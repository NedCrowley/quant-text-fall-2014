        "[\"This paper provides a historical overview of the way journalists have reported the issue of poverty. The paper outlines three identifiable paradigms relating to how journalists frame poverty. The first paradigm was dominated by intellectuals from the Victorian-era who promoted ideas about poverty within an individualist framework that used various intellectual justifications that blamed the poor for their own poverty. The ideals promoted by Victorian-era intellectuals could be understood as operating through the conceptual lens of \\xe2\\x80\\x98social Darwinism\\xe2\\x80\\x99.  These elite narratives became unsustainable following the great depression, the rise of workers movements and the expansion of the democratic franchise in the United Kingdom and the United States. In the aftermath of the Second World War a transatlantic economic consensus of collectivism developed with the creation of the New Deal in the United States and the British welfare state. These narratives dominated until the late 1970's when the press embarked on a widespread critique of social welfare programs. The critique of social welfare programs manifested itself as a critique of the poor themselves. This developed into a range of critiques which reflected the individualist narratives of the Victorian-era.  Discourses that blamed the poor for their own poverty re-emerged through concepts like the \\xe2\\x80\\x98underclass\\xe2\\x80\\x99 which echoed the \\xe2\\x80\\x98social Darwinism\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of the Victorian-era. This paper will examine the use of the \\xe2\\x80\\x98underclass\\xe2\\x80\\x99 concept by journalists by focusing on its links to the discourses of the Victorian-era and its development and promotion by intellectual elites who, in the contemporary-era work for Conservative think tanks.\",\n",
        " 'The UN declaration of human rights articulates a right to health inseparable from rights to other basic needs -- food, housing, education, gainful employment, old age pension, and leisure. The premise is that the promotion and protection of health requires living conditions that assure human dignity. At the turn of the 21st century, several governments in Latin America assumed the responsibility to guarantee a life of dignity for all their citizens.  One such country, Venezuela, stood up to the challenge by appropriating, via the electoral system, the power of the state to turn it into an instrument of the power of the people. This Poder Popular, or popular power, had been suppressed in Venezuela despite decades of Western-style liberal democracy, which granted a right to vote yet in practice suppressed the actual political, economic, cultural and social participation of the majority of Venezuelans in their society. Since 1999, the Venezuelan people have found new and powerful ways of expression through a revolutionary Constitution enshrining a range of people-centered public policies.   This presentation will familiarize participants with these policies by describing the historical development of the struggle of the Venezuelan people for a life of dignity.  It will highlight the role of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMissions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d, the Bolivarian Government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s instruments to guarantee universal rights to food, housing, health, education, gainful employment, information, and leisure, among other factors contributing to human welfare.  It will also elaborate on current challenges to, and opportunities for, achieving the goal of social justice embedded in the Bolivarian vision.']"

Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this paper investigates how the level of family disadvantage of schoolmates in grades 7-8 (school-level index based on parents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 education, poverty status, family structure, and teenage parenting) relates to the educational attainment of African American males in early adulthood.  How do patterns for black males compare with those for black females and white youth, after accounting for individual family disadvantages and other family, school, and individual covariates?  Results support the hypothesis that concentrated schoolmate disadvantage more negatively relates to educational attainment among African American males than females.  Among black males, schoolmate disadvantage negatively predicts high school graduation and college entry, net of individual, family, and school factors.  Among black males, each unit increase in the school median family disadvantage index is associated with a 29% decline in the odds of completing high school (odds ratio=.71, p<.05) and a 35% decline in the odds of entering college (odds ratio=.65, p<.01), conditional on completing high school.   By contrast, schoolmate disadvantage shows no relationship to educational attainment for black females after accounting for individual family disadvantage.  Gender patterns differ among whites.')\n",

Approximately 7.4% of boys and 17.9% of girls reported purposefully hurting themselves without wanting to die at least once during the previous 12 months. Fighting, forced sex, being bullied, being sad, planning suicide, attempting suicide, identifying as gay or lesbian, trying to change body weight, and alcohol, tobacco, and drug use were significantly correlated with self-injury.

As the official museum for documenting and displaying Belgian colonialism in Central Africa from 1885-1960, the RMCA has received ardent criticism and praise from contemporary publics in Belgium and beyond.

Using the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS), the Education Longitudinal Study (ELS), and Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM), I attempt to address these issues by examining (1) the prevalence of disruptions in high school, (2) the relationship between victimization in school and disruptions in school, (3) student- and school-level factors related to disruptions, and (4) the ability of curriculum track placement and school disciplinary practices to mediate the relationship between student and school factors and disruptions. Findings suggest that disruptions in high school are remarkably common but are experienced to a greater extent by historically marginalized students in traditionally troubled schools. However, after student and school factors are held constant in HLM analyses, only student-level factors are related to disruptions in school. This indicates that disruptions in school are not due to features of troubled schools themselves, but are due to the background characteristics of the students such schools educate.

We estimated weighted Cox regression models. Men had higher summary AL than women (p < .001), and higher metabolic and cardiovascular risk (both p < .001); women had higher inflammatory risk (p < .001). Men were twice as likely to have ever smoked than women (66% vs. 38%). AL had a strong, positive association with earlier death for men and women (both p < .001).  This effect remained strong regardless of predictors entered. Lifetime tobacco use was the sole health behavior associated with earlier mortality for both men and women (both p < .001), and was stronger for women (HR = 1.83) than men (HR = 1.57), despite their lower prevalence of lifetime smoking. Conclusions: AL continues is a strong pathway in mortality research in that its effect appears independent of numerous demographic, socioeconomic, and correlated health variables. Lifetime tobacco use is a strong predictor of earlier mortality. Further research is needed on how tobacco use is influenced by neighborhood structure for men and women, including investigation into tobacco advertisement and availability, and associations with stress and AL.
