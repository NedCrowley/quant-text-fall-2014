Kim, Young-Choon & Mooweon Rhee. 2010. 'the Contingent Effect of Social Networks on Organizational Commitment: a Comparison of Instrumental and Expressive Ties in a Multinational High-technology Company.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:4 479-502.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	0	This article examines the relationship between social networks and organizational commitment in a globalized workplace. The authors find not only that organizational commitment is affected by the network properties of size, power connection, and national/ethnic composition but also that these network effects are contingent upon whether the content conveyed in the relationship is instrumental or expressive. Results demonstrate that organizational commitment is (1) positively associated with network size in instrumental ties but not in expressive ties, (2) positively associated with the power of network partners in instrumental ties but less so in expressive ties, and (3) positively associated with national/ethnic diversity in expressive ties but not in instrumental ties. Findings highlight the relational foundation of organizational commitment and suggest that social networks of employees, contingent upon specific content, present different opportunities to their level of commitment to the organization.	2	Young-Choon Kim; Mooweon Rhee
Hull, Brooks & Jody Lipford. 2010. 'Free Riding, Market Structure, and Church Member Donations in South Carolina.' Review of Religious Research. 52:2 172-187.	Review of Religious Research	2010	1	The research literature on factors influencing member donations to churches is extensive. This paper uses unique data from South Carolina Baptist congregations to confirm much of the research, particularly including the potential for free-riding by members, but also extends that research by exploring the differential effect on donations of competition among Baptist congregations and between Baptist and non-Baptist congregations. We employ hierarchical linear modeling, rarely used in religious research but particularly well suited to the data, some of which is by congregation and some of which is by county. Previous empirical and theoretical work offers contradictory conclusions. We review the theory, clarifying some issues. Our results confirm that free riding increases as congregations grow larger, an effect mitigated by the increasing level of services offered as congregations grow. Importantly competition between Baptist congregations reduces and competition with non-Baptist congregations increases per member donations.	2	Brooks B. Hull; Jody Lipford

Tubergen, Frank. 2010. 'Determinants of Second Language Proficiency Among Refugees in the Netherlands.' Social Forces. 89:2 515-534.	Social Forces	2010	1	Little is known about the language acquisition of refugees in Western countries. This study examines how pre- and post-migration characteristics of refugees are related to their second language proficiency. Data are from a survey of 3,500 refugees, who were born in Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, former Yugoslavia and Somalia, and who resided in the Netherlands. The analysis shows that speaking and reading skills are better among refugees who received more pre-migration schooling, who migrated from a major city, and who arrived in the host country at a younger age. Post-migration characteristics are also important. Language skills are better among refugees who only lived in a refugee reception center for a short while, who completed an integration course, who received post-migration education, who intend to stay in the host country, and who have fewer health problems.	1	Frank Tubergen
Pudrovska, Tetyana. 2010. 'Why Is Cancer More Depressing for Men Than Women Among Older White Adults?.' Social Forces. 89:2 535-558.	Social Forces	2010	0	Using data from two waves of the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (N = 8,054), I examine gender differences in psychological adjustment to cancer among older white adults. Results from different types of longitudinal models reveal that cancer has more adverse psychological implications for men than women. Men's higher levels of depression are reduced after adjustment for adherence to masculinity ideals of strength, independence and invincibility. Cancer poses a threat to the masculine identity because it entails lack of control over one's body and other consequences incompatible with traditional masculinity. This study contributes to sociological knowledge of the ways in which gender shapes psychological resilience and vulnerability to cancer through meanings people attach to gender roles.	1	Tetyana Pudrovska
Rude, Jesse & Daniel Herda. 2010. 'Best Friends Forever? Race and the Stability of Adolescent Friendships.' Social Forces. 89:2 585-607.	Social Forces	2010	4	Our research uses two waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to analyze the stability of same- and cross-race friendships. We find the following: First, interracial friendships are less stable than same-race friendships, even after controlling for a variety of contextual and dyadic characteristics, such as school racial composition and friends' similarities in attitudes and behaviors. Second, measures of dyadic similarity (aside from race) are weak predictors of friendship stability. Third, measures of reciprocity and closeness are strong predictors of friendship stability and appear to dampen the effects of racial difference. These results indicate that race is of continuing significance in structuring the social lives of American adolescents. They call into question the assumption that the factors that drive friendship formation also drive friendship stability. And, they suggest that more attention should be paid to the quality of interracial friendships, as measured by degree of reciprocity and closeness.	2	Jesse Rude; Daniel Herda
Smangs, Mattias. 2010. 'Delinquency, Social Skills and the Structure of Peer Relations: Assessing Criminological Theories by Social Network Theory.' Social Forces. 89:2 609-631.	Social Forces	2010	1	This article explores the plausibility of the conflicting theoretical assumptions underlying the main criminological perspectives on juvenile delinquents, their peer relations and social skills: the social ability model, represented by Sutherland's theory of differential associations, and the social disability model, represented by Hirschi's control theory. It does so by applying the principles associated with Granovetter's theory of strong and weak ties, drawing out its theoretical implications for the criminological theories and deriving a number of hypotheses. The article uses ``strategic research materials'' in the form of a data set strongly biased towards the social disability model and containing information on co-offending relations among a population (N = 580) of juveniles in a Swedish town during a three-year period. Results from cross-sectional empirical analyses using, among other things, the Quadratic Assignment Procedure, clearly support the social ability model. The robustness of the initial analyses is checked through longitudinal analyses applying actor-oriented statistical models for network evolution. The article's implications for criminological, as well as multidisciplinary, research are discussed.	1	Mattias Smangs
Dahl, Michael & Olav Sorenson. 2010. 'the Social Attachment to Place.' Social Forces. 89:2 633-658.	Social Forces	2010	7	Many theories either implicitly or explicitly assume that individuals readily move to places that improve their financial well-being. Other forces, however, offset these tendencies; for example, people often wish to remain close to family and friends. We introduce a methodology for determining how individuals weigh these countervailing forces, and estimate how both financial and social factors influence geographic mobility in the Danish population. Our results suggest that individuals respond to opportunities for higher pay elsewhere, but that their sensitivity to this factor pales in comparison to their preferences for living near family and friends.	2	Michael S.

Michel, Noemi & Manuela Honegger. 2010. 'Thinking Whiteness in French and Swiss Cyberspaces.' Social Politics. 17:4, SI 423-449.	Social Politics	2010	0	Despite their insistence on the common European colonial roots of whiteness, critical whiteness studies tend to focus on Anglophone contexts. This article explores the theoretical and analytical potential of deploying the concept of whiteness in other spaces, namely French and Swiss cyberspaces. First, we define whiteness as a ``white vanguard narrative'' which generates a discursive border distinguishing subjectivities or practices, and which changes across time and space. Second, we explore the discursive operation of whiteness in two cyber-debates hosted by a French blog and a Swiss blog. This comparative micropolitical analysis of discursive spaces-marked by very different colonial legacies-reveals the fluidity and heterogeneity of the marking processes through which racialized power relations continue to be disseminated in postcolonial Europe.	2	Noemi Michel; Manuela Honegger
Swan, Elaine. 2010. 'States of White Ignorance, and Audit Masculinity in English Higher Education.' Social Politics. 17:4, SI 477-506.	Social Politics	2010	1	Drawing upon recent literature on what has been called ``epistemologies of ignorance'' in relation to race, this paper examines an audit of a research project on equality and diversity in a UK university. It argues the audit functioned as a technology of ignorance. This paper suggests that the audit drew upon the cultural associations between white male academic masculinity with notions of quantification, detachment, and disembodied aggression. In this way, ignorance is seen as a form of labor. In particular, this paper suggests that current forms of neoliberal audit in UK universities could be understood in terms of Haraway's notion of scientific gentlemanly modest witnessing. But rather than the scientific gentlemanly masculinity, neoliberal audit legitimates a hyper-rational audit masculinity which casts women and racialized minorities as subjective, interested, and emotional and in so doing performs epistemic violence which maintains whiteness.	1	Elaine Swan
Leonard, Pauline. 2010. 'Old Colonial or New Cosmopolitan? Changing White Identities in the Hong Kong Police.' Social Politics. 17:4, SI 507-535.	Social Politics	2010	0	This paper explores the construction of whiteness, masculinity, and expatriate citizenship in the changing landscape of postcolonial Hong Kong. The context of the Hong Kong Police Force and the career of a long-serving senior British officer are used to examine changes in the meanings of whiteness in the new national and organizational contexts which have followed the handover of the Region from the British to the Chinese in 1997. Analysis reveals the place the organization may play in the construction of white identities and privileges and how, in the intersection of organizational practices and policies with personal biography, whiteness may serve to resist broader initiatives for integration. Although in their global mobility white skilled migrants may suggest performances of new cosmopolitan forms of citizenship, this paper argues that shifts towards a postidentity politics of cultural hybridity and integration can seem slow to appear in transnational expatriate contexts.	1	Pauline Leonard
O'Connell, Anne. 2010. 'an Exploration of Redneck Whiteness in Multicultural Canada.' Social Politics. 17:4, SI 536-563.	Social Politics	2010	2	As Canada celebrates forty years of official multiculturalism (1971), a shifting urban/rural dyad (Neal) is central to its configuration. Its urban centers are positioned as diverse racialized spaces unlike their less diverse and more white rural counterparts. In this paper, I explore the relationships between rurality, whiteness, and multiculturalism through the rise of the redneck in North America and the Canadian Redneck Games in rural Ontario. While seemingly politically incorrect, I argue that these expressions of rural whiteness provide both critique and coherence to liberal whiteness and multicultural policies. Celebrations of rural whiteness uphold the frontier narratives (Furniss), the past which helps structure multiculturalism as a contemporary form of white liberal tolerance of and benevolence toward Indigenous peoples and racialized others. These mutually sustaining narratives constitute a contemporary politics which is unable to address past colonial crimes and contemporary racial violence.	1	Anne O'Connell
Lively, Kathryn, Lala Steelman & Brian Powell. 2010. 'Equity, Emotion, and Household Division of Labor Response.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 73:4 358-379.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	3	Building upon insights generated by social psychological scholarship on equity, emotions, and identity, we use the General Social Survey (1996) Modules on Emotion and Gender and the National Survey of Family and Households (1992-1994) to investigate the relationship between perceived inequity in the household division of labor and emotion. These surveys enable us to assess the degree to which patterns identified in short-term laboratory studies of relative strangers are generalizable to enduring relationships among intimates. We move beyond existing studies that link inequity in the home with depression by incorporating a broader scope of emotions and further by distinguishing between underbenefiting and overbenefiting-i.e., doing what one considers more or less than one's fair share-and by examining these processes for women and men. We find general support for principles of equity theory: That is, emotions are closely tied to perceived inequity in the division of household labor. Guided by insights from Kemper's structural interactional theory of emotion and affect control theory, we show that this pattern differs by specific emotions, the direction of the inequity, and the sex of the perceiver. Implications for understanding emotion, equity theory, and family are then elaborated.	3	Kathryn J. Lively; Lala Carr Steelman; Brian Powell
Baker, Joseph. 2010. 'Social Sources of the Spirit: Connecting Rational Choice and Interactive Ritual Theories in the Study of Religion.' Sociology of Religion. 71:4 432-456.	Sociology of Religion	2010	3	In recent years rational choice approaches have increasingly been employed in the sociological study of religion; however, theory and research from this perspective typically overlook the role of emotionally efficacious collective rituals. This study synthesizes interactive ritual theory with the rational choice concept of strictness, which highlights the level of behavioral prohibitions religious groups place on adherents. Analyses of data from the first wave of the National Congregations Study indicate a positive relationship between a group's level of behavioral strictness and the production of an enthusiastic, outwardly emotive worship style. In general, the effort is made to highlight the utility of combining a focus on the production of collective, social ``goods'' in religious groups with considerations of interactive rituals and emotion.	1	Joseph O.

Frank, David, Bayliss Camp & Steven Boutcher. 2010. 'Worldwide Trends in the Criminal Regulation of Sex, 1945 to 2005.' American Sociological Review. 75:6 867-893.	American Sociological Review	2010	12	Between 1945 and 2005, nation-states around the world revised their criminal laws on sexual activities. This global reform wave-across countries and domains of sexual activity-followed from the reconstitution of world models of society around individuals rather than corporate bodies. During the post-World War II period, this process rearranged the global cultural and organizational underpinnings of sex, eroding world-level support for criminal laws aimed at protecting collective entities-especially the family and the nation-and strengthening world support for laws aimed at protecting individualized persons. To make our case, we use unique cross-national and longitudinal data on the criminal regulation of rape, adultery, sodomy, and child sexual abuse. The data reveal striking counter-directional trends in sex-law reforms, which simultaneously elaborated regulations protecting individuals and dissolved laws protecting collective entities. World-level negative-binomial regression analyses and country-level event-history analyses confirm our main propositions. The findings demonstrate a sweeping revolution in criminal-sex laws, rooted in the intensified global celebration of free-standing personhood.	3	David John Frank; Bayliss J. Camp; Steven A. Boutcher
Tanaka, Keiko & Patrick Mooney. 2010. 'Public Scholarship and Community Engagement in Building Community Food Security: the Case of the University of Kentucky.' Rural Sociology. 75:4 560-583.	Rural Sociology	2010	1	P>The current call for public scholarship and community engagement by universities and disciplinary organizations has created opportunities to develop innovative ways to integrate research, instruction, and outreach. This article discusses a collaboration among scholars at the University of Kentucky and alternative agrifood movement organizations that has evolved as they pursue an alternative agrifood system in Kentucky. This collaboration made instructional programs in sociology and the honors world food issues track places in which both students and instructors can examine ``problems'' of the conventional agrifood system, conduct research, and develop collaborative relationships with community activists. We draw on Burawoy's discussion of public sociology and its interface with professional, critical, and policy sociologies. Supplementing our discussion with literature from social movements and science studies, we demonstrate how this integrated approach can render sociological knowledge and skills useful as critical support of alternative agrifood movements. We argue that the ``experiential classroom'' is an excellent site for the critical examination within the agrifood movements of oppositional culture. This, in turn, makes possible students' recognition of injustice in the existing agrifood system.	2	Keiko Tanaka; Patrick H. Mooney
Winson, Anthony. 2010. 'the Demand for Healthy Eating: Supporting a Transformative Food ``movement''.' Rural Sociology. 75:4 584-600.	Rural Sociology	2010	2	P>To the extent that social science scholarship engages real-world developments it remains grounded and better able to resist elite agendas. With this in mind this article argues for the critical encounter with what I argue is the most significant struggle around food and agriculture today-the amorphous and broad-based movement that strives to resist the further degradation of food environments and ensure healthy eating in society. This struggle is inevitably engaged with contemporary neoliberal agendas that have transformed and degraded food environments as they have privileged profit making over healthy diets. The article considers different sites where the struggle over healthy eating is taking place, both at the level of the state and more extensively in civil society. It considers the debate over bovine growth hormone in Canada and the wider efforts to turn around school food environments as examples of state-centered and civil-society struggles, respectively, that illustrate different dimensions of the healthy-eating movement today. In each case the agendas of transnational food corporations are seen to be directly contradicting efforts to ensure healthy diets. The article considers some notable successes among advocates of healthy eating, in the United States and Canada and most notably in Britain, and examines some of the factors that may account for this success. Overall, I argue that this struggle has the potential to challenge the hegemony of neoliberal discourse in fundamental ways. The article concludes with a call for academics, and rural sociologists in particular, to give a much greater priority to healthy-eating struggles, and considers a number of areas where academic practitioners can aid activists' efforts to resist the further degradation of diets and establish healthier food environments.	1	Anthony Winson
Santoro, Marco. 2010. 'Constructing an Artistic Field as a Political Project: Lessons From La Scala.' Poetics. 38:6, SI 534-554.	Poetics	2010	5	This article revisits the ``high culture model'' of Paul DiMaggio by taking as its empirical reference the experience of opera in Italy particularly the history of one of the foremost institutions of the operatic world, the theater La Scala, from the late 1700s through the early 1900s. Five aspects are discussed as relevant for an understanding of opera in Italy: the imprinting effect of the court system, the heritage of the Risorgimento (i.e., the historical period in which national unity was gained in the 1800s), the ascension of the middle classes and the making of a working class, the role of professionals acting as cultural entrepreneurs with international links and careers (especially that of Arturo Toscanini), and the influence of mass political parties and regimes. By arguing that the construction of an institutional field of opera should be framed also as a project of extension of political control over civil society promoted by parties (Socialists) and regimes (Fascism), this articles sheds new comparative light on classification in art while also contributing a sociological explanation for the apparently ambivalent status of opera (in Italy and possibly elsewhere) as a genre that is both highbrow and popular.	1	Marco Santoro
Godart, Frederic & Harrison White. 2010. 'Switchings Under Uncertainty: the Coming and Becoming of Meanings.' Poetics. 38:6, SI 567-586.	Poetics	2010	5	While structure and culture often are proclaimed dual and yet autonomous, this paper spells out a processual approach in which structure and culture are seen as intertwined and interdependent formations. To that end, we aim at understanding how meanings come to be, then build into process, and become integrated in a set of constructs of differing scopes, scales, and levels collectively known as ``culture.'' Meanings are ``sparks'' generated by irregular switchings across socio-cultural compounds called ``netdoms,'' mixtures of social networks and semiotic domains. Switchings originate from identities mitigating uncertainty from biophysical sources and from attempts at control by other identities. A ``story'' concatenates meanings in a relational structure within a horizon of possibilities. Netdoms constitute the fabric of socio-cultural life, wherein domains-through stories-provide the interpretive texture, while networks-through relations-supply the social texture. Socio-cultural formations invoking more complex compounds of stories (story-lines and plots) thereby frame social time, enabling, through narratives, mobilization for social action. We further model a level of syncopated complexity, denoted ``style,'' which illuminates the puzzle of how culture and structure fit together.

UK on January 15th, 2008, at the Harvard Business School on March 17, 2008, and at the American Sociological Association Annual Meeting in San Francisco on August 8, 2009.)	2	Frederic C.

Fontdevila, Jorge. 2010. 'Indexes, Power, and Netdoms: a Multidimensional Model of Language in Social Action.' Poetics. 38:6, SI 587-609.	Poetics	2010	0	Across a wide range of scholarship on language, tensions emerge about the relationship between grammar and practice. I explore these tensions and argue that they can be expressed along three analytical dimensions: semiotic, power, and relational. The semiotic dimension shows that language communicates not only symbolic-referential content but primarily the nature of the speech event as a socio-cultural phenomenon in its own right. Thus meaning-and cultural semiosis in general-is mostly about reflexive indexicality. The power dimension points to language as an ambiguous game embedded in conflict and seldom about building consensus. The relational dimension captures whether language stems from the face-to-face or from social network traces of broader interactional times and spaces. I conclude with a multidimensional model of communicative action, and assert that these tensions symbolic versus indexical, consensus versus conflict, face-to-face versus network-arise from uncritically conflating the empirical with the analytical. My goal is to contribute to broader metatheoretical debates on the linkages between structure and agency in social action.	1	Jorge Fontdevila

Poetics	2010	2	This article analyzes debates over workfare in New York City in the 1990s in order to shed light on three related questions with respect to policy debates in general. How should we understand the creation of meaning in policy debates? How should we understand the different power that actors and their claims may have in shaping the boundaries and terms of these debates, and how is this power related to the question of meaning? And finally, if we are to understand policy debates as changeable, how do we account for changes in the power of actors and claims within them, and in the meanings that they enable? In order to focus on the interactions among multiple actors, claims, and institutional settings I turn to structural analysis of culture and the network-analytic techniques associated with it. By breaking down more than ten years of claim-making into eight periods and by coding actors, their claims, and the contexts in which they make them. I look at how actors, claims, and settings combine to produce variously contested and settled meanings of political claims, and at changes in the power actors and claims have in setting the terms of political debate as a whole.	1	John Krinsky
Kaplan, Elaine. 2010. 'Doing Care on the Run: Family Strategies in the Contested Terrain of Gender and Institutional Intransigence.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 39:6 587-618.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	1	This study draws on the literature on care and on parents' perceptions of their teenagers' needs and on their own abilities and their spouses' ability to perform the necessary caring tasks. Ethnographic interviews with 30 working parents revealed three specific caring strategies-the scheduling parent, the worry-shift parent, and the parent of last resort-all designed to maintain a sense of control over their teenagers. Rather than produce strategies that are based on negotiations with family members, parents in this study tended to develop their own individual strategies when confronted with a set of problems in caring for young teenagers, principle among these is the contested nature of teenagers' need for care-contested by the educational institution, by employers, by spouses, and teenagers themselves. The study concludes by suggesting that these parents' strategies lead to unequal divisions of emotional care that are shaped by gender and institutional	1	Elaine Bell Kaplan
Hochschild, Thomas. 2010. '``our Club'': Place-work and the Negotiation of Collective Belongingness.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 39:6 619-645.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	1	This research examines the process by which vying social groups negotiate collective belongingness within contested space. At an American Legion veterans' post, two factions-the Skeet Club and the New Regime-developed strong emotional attachments to the location. The Skeet Club consisted of ineligible townspeople who had illegally gained access to the post through the help of several legitimate members. For Skeet Club members, the post was a beloved social club where strong social bonds had developed over the course of many years. For the New Regime, the post was first and foremost a shrine to honor and assist military veterans. These divergent interpretations resulted in a process the author calls place-work, whereby members of the two factions struggled to establish a definition of the location that would allow their respective groups to feel that ``we belong.'' The four place-work strategies observed include (1) the presentation of group value, (2) deference to organizational culture, (3) spatial control, and (4) out-group intimidation. Through these strategies, ``collective belongingness'' was constructed, presented, and maintained as a resource in intergroup conflict. This study builds on the literatures regarding place, emotion, and intergroup conflict.	1	Thomas R. Hochschild
Leverentz, Andrea. 2010. 'People, Places, and Things: How Female Ex-prisoners Negotiate Their Neighborhood Context.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 39:6 646-681.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	4	While many prisoners share the public and policy makers' concerns about returning to their former neighborhood when they are released from prison, recently released ex-prisoners often do not have the resources to move to a new neighborhood. Using multiple in-depth interviews with female ex-prisoners in Chicago, the author addresses how these women frame their often disadvantaged and racially segregated neighborhood contexts so that they are consistent with their desire to desist from offending. While some women believed they should avoid old neighborhoods, many reframed their neighborhood context as a neutral or positive force, both for them and the community. Three common frames emerged in the data, all of which emphasize the women's self-efficacy and agency: drugs are unavoidable and so neighborhood is irrelevant, there is comfort in familiarity, and their pasts can be used to help and inspire others in their community. In addition, the author addresses the ways in which these frames are influenced by their involvement in drug treatment programming and by race, class, and gender. These findings suggest a need to expand how research and policy address the neighborhood context of prisoner reentry.	1	Andrea Leverentz
Shwed, Uri & Peter Bearman. 2010. 'the Temporal Structure of Scientific Consensus Formation.' American Sociological Review. 75:6 817-840.	American Sociological Review	2010	12	This article engages with problems that are usually opaque: What trajectories do scientific debates assume, when does a scientific community consider a proposition to be a fact, and how can we know that? We develop a strategy for evaluating the state of scientific contestation on issues. The analysis builds from Latour's black box imagery, which we observe in scientific citation networks. We show that as consensus forms, the importance of internal divisions to the overall network structure declines. We consider substantive cases that are now considered facts, such as the carcinogenicity of smoking and the non-carcinogenicity of coffee. We then employ the same analysis to currently contested cases: the suspected carcinogenicity of cellular phones, and the relationship between vaccines and autism. Extracting meaning from the internal structure of scientific knowledge carves a niche for renewed sociological commentary on science, revealing a typology of trajectories that scientific propositions may experience en route to consensus.	2	Uri Shwed; Peter S.

Andrews, Kenneth & Neal Caren. 2010. 'Making the News: Movement Organizations, Media Attention, and the Public Agenda.' American Sociological Review. 75:6 841-866.	American Sociological Review	2010	15	Increasingly, scholars have come to see the news media as playing a pivotal role in shaping whether social movements are able to bring about broader social change. By drawing attention to movements' issues, claims, and supporters, the news media can shape the public agenda by influencing public opinion, authorities, and elites. Why are some social movement organizations more successful than others at gaining media coverage? Specifically, what organizational, tactical, and issue characteristics enhance media attention? We combine detailed organizational survey data from a representative sample of 187 local environmental organizations in North Carolina with complete news coverage of those organizations in 11 major daily newspapers in the two years following the survey (2,095 articles). Our analyses reveal that local news media favor professional and formalized groups that employ routine advocacy tactics, mobilize large numbers of people, and work on issues that overlap with newspapers' focus on local economic growth and well-being. Groups that are confrontational, volunteer-led, or advocate on behalf of novel issues do not garner as much attention in local media outlets. These findings have important implications and challenge widely held claims about the pathways by which movement actors shape the public agenda through the news media.	2	Kenneth T.

Turco, Catherine. 2010. 'Cultural Foundations of Tokenism: Evidence From the Leveraged Buyout Industry.' American Sociological Review. 75:6 894-913.	American Sociological Review	2010	11	Existing explanations of tokenism predict similar experiences for all numerically small, low-status groups. These explanations, however, cannot account for variation in the experiences of different low-status minority groups within the same setting. This article develops a theory of tokenism that explains such variation. Drawing on 117 interviews in the leveraged buyout industry (LBO) and a comparison of the differing experiences of female and African American male tokens in that setting, I argue that tokenism is contingent on the local cultural context in which it is embedded. Specifically, I identify two elements of an occupation's culture-its hierarchy of cultural resources and its image of the ideal worker-that can specify some status characteristics as more relevant to and incompatible with the occupation's work than others. In LBO, the industry values cultural resources that, on average, women lack but men possess, and the ideal worker is defined such that it directly conflicts with cultural beliefs about motherhood. Consequently, in this context, gender is a more relevant status characteristic for exclusion than is race, and female tokens are differentially disadvantaged. In addition to revising received wisdom about tokenism, this study integrates and advances social psychological and cultural theories of exclusion by deepening our understanding of the role of cultural resources and schemas in occupational inequality.	1	Catherine J.

Lim, Chaeyoon & Robert Putnam. 2010. 'Religion, Social Networks, and Life Satisfaction.' American Sociological Review. 75:6 914-933.	American Sociological Review	2010	38	Although the positive association between religiosity and life satisfaction is well documented, much theoretical and empirical controversy surrounds the question of how religion actually shapes life satisfaction. Using a new panel dataset, this study offers strong evidence for social and participatory mechanisms shaping religion's impact on life satisfaction. Our findings suggest that religious people are more satisfied with their lives because they regularly attend religious services and build social networks in their congregations. The effect of within-congregation friendship is contingent, however, on the presence of a strong religious identity. We find little evidence that other private or subjective aspects of religiosity affect life satisfaction independent of attendance and congregational friendship.	2	Chaeyoon Lim; Robert D. Putnam
Kim, ChangHwan & Arthur Sakamoto. 2010. 'Have Asian American Men Achieved Labor Market Parity With White Men?.' American Sociological Review. 75:6 934-957.	American Sociological Review	2010	6	We use the 2003 National Survey of College Graduates to investigate earnings differentials between white and Asian American men. We extend prior literature by disaggregating Asian Americans by their immigration status in relation to the U.S. educational system, and by accounting for the effects of field of study and college type. Net of the latter variables and other demographic controls, native-born Asian American men have 8 percent lower earnings than do measurably comparable white men. Our findings show that Asian American men who were schooled entirely overseas have substantial earnings disadvantages, while Asian American men who obtained their highest degree in the United States but completed high school overseas have an intermediate earnings disadvantage. Net of the control variables, including region of residence, only 1.5-generation Asian American men appear to have reached full parity with whites. Most Asian American men lag at least slightly behind white men in terms of full equality in the labor market net of the measured covariates in our statistical models. No one theoretical approach seems able to explain our findings; instead, we suggest the relevance of several perspectives, including the racialized hierarchy view, the demographic heterogeneity approach, and assimilation theory.	2	ChangHwan Kim; Arthur Sakamoto

American Sociological Review	2010	11	Research consistently demonstrates that females engage in less criminal behavior than males across the life course, but research on the variability of the gender gap across contexts is sparse. To address this issue, we examine the gender gap in self-reported violent crime among adolescents across neighborhoods. Multilevel models using data from the Project of Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) indicate that the gender gap in violent crime decreases as levels of neighborhood disadvantage increase. Furthermore, the narrowing of the gender gap is explained by gender differences in peer influence on violent offending. Neighborhood disadvantage increases exposure to peer violence for both sexes, but peer violence has a stronger impact on violent offending for females than for males; this produces the reduction in the gender gap at higher levels of disadvantage. We also find that the gender difference in the relationship between peer violence and offending is explained, in part, by (1) the tendency for females to have more intimate friendships than do males and (2) the moderating effect of peer intimacy on the relationship between peer violence and self-reported violent behavior.	2	Gregory M.

Shlay, Anne & Gillad Rosen. 2010. 'Making Place: the Shifting Green Line and the Development of ``greater'' Metropolitan Jerusalem.' City \& Community. 9:4 358-389.	City \& Community	2010	6	This paper is about place making in Jerusalem, an important city at the heart of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. It examines how place making in Jerusalem has had the consequence of shifting what is known as the Green Line. The Green Line represents the armistice or ceasefire boundaries following the end of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Development of different parts of captured territories after the 1967 War has shifted and rendered unstable perceptions of the Green Line and has wreaked havoc with prevailing conceptions over what constitutes Jerusalem. Symbolic and social boundary reconstruction is at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, a powerfully organized mechanism that tilts power to Israel with the use of bulldozers, bricks, and cranes as well as tanks and weapons. The shifting Green Line represents a battle line of an idea war over Israel's ability to claim legitimacy over a new Jerusalem. This paper examines the dynamic processes of how boundaries are being shifted through narratives of various actors involved in these processes.	2	Anne B. Shlay; Gillad Rosen
Gazit, Nir. 2010. 'Boundaries in Interaction: the Cultural Fabrication of Social Boundaries in West Jerusalem.' City \& Community. 9:4 390-413.	City \& Community	2010	2	Boundary work projects are relevant in any social context, but they seem to carry particular significance in multicultural or multinational and highly contested urban settings. This study examines how daily artifacts such as local newspapers are used by various urban social groups in their local boundary work projects. The analysis is based on the particular case of West Jerusalem, and focuses on how Jewish communities use the popular local Jerusalem newspaper Kol Ha'Ir (''Whole of the City''). The study shows that local newspapers have three functions: (1) they are important components in the local cultural tool kit that various groups use and relate to; (2) they are cultural objects exploited by communities to redefine and regulate their particular identities and to sustain a common ground for local solidarity; and (3) they serve as mechanisms that construct and maintain an ethnonational front toward rival communities within their urban space. This study also suggests that in order to facilitate such a complex task of boundary work, cultural objects must be polysemous. First, they should produce to some degree a consensus among their various consumers on their content and social significance. Second, they should permit a range of interpretations regarding their particular social meaning for each group.	1	Nir Gazit
Larkin, Craig. 2010. 'Remaking Beirut: Contesting Memory, Space, and the Urban Imaginary of Lebanese Youth.' City \& Community. 9:4 414-442.	City \& Community	2010	2	Throughout the centuries Beirut has had an endless capacity for reinvention and transformation, a consequence of migration, conquest, trade, and internal conflict. The last three decades have witnessed the city center's violent self-destruction, its commercial resurrection, and most recently its national contestation, as oppositional political forces have sought to mobilize mass demonstrations and occupy strategic space. While research has been directed to the transformative processes and the principal actors involved, little attention has been given to how the next generation of Lebanese are negotiating Beirut's rehabilitation. This article seeks to address this lacuna, by exploring how postwar youth remember, imagine, and spatially encounter their city. How does Beirut's rebuilt urban landscape, with its remnants of war, sites of displacement, and transformed environs, affect and inform identity, social interaction, and perceptions of the past? Drawing on Henri Lefebvre's analysis of the social construction of space (perceived, conceived, and lived) and probing the inherent tensions within postwar youths' encounters with history, memory, and heritage, the article presents a dynamic and complex urban imaginary of Beirut. An examination of key urban sites (Solidere's Down Town) and significant temporal moments (Independence Intifada) reveals three recurring tensions evident in Lebanese youth's engagement with their city: dislocation and liberation, spectacle and participant, pluralism and fracture. This article seeks to encourage wider discussion on the nature of postwar recovery and the construction of rehabilitated public space, amidst the backdrop of global consumerism and heritage campaigns.	1	Craig Larkin
Woolfson, Charles. 2010. '`hard Times' in Lithuania: Crisis and `discourses of Discontent' in Post-communist Society.' Ethnography. 11:4 487-514.	Ethnography	2010	6	This article analyses the intersection of global recession with the underlying crisis of neo-liberalism in Baltic Lithuania, and the disappointment of expectations regarding the promised benefits of free market capitalism for the citizens of post-communist society. Drawing on an empirical analysis of Lithuania, a new European Union member state and former Soviet republic, the post-communist trajectory of neo-liberal economic and social development is critiqued. Global economic and financial crisis has resulted in a social and economic `shock'. It occurred in an environment already marked by disappointment, alienation and high outward migration. Through an analysis of `voice' expressed in `discourses of discontent', the article attempts to chart the impact of `hard times'. It predicts a new `exit' in the form of a surge of outward migration resulting from the failures of `voice', and the concerning possibility of `internal exit'.	1	Charles Woolfson
Green, Paul. 2010. 'Generation, Family and Migration: Young Brazilian Factory Workers in Japan.' Ethnography. 11:4 515-532.	Ethnography	2010	1	This article focuses on the significance of generational difference and kinship ties in the lives of young Brazilian migrants living and working in Japan. On these terms, I transcend an ongoing tendency in transnational migration studies to highlight the importance of economic motivation, a myth of return and the primary significance of communal ties in the shaping of everyday migrant experiences. By treating generational difference as a kin relationship I consider the central influence of family in shaping the experiences and future plans of young Brazilian migrants in Japan. By considering generational difference as a migrant relationship I discuss young people's perceptions of freedom, familial obligation and easy money in the light of contested understandings of what it means to be a Brazilian migrant in Japan. Through this analysis, the article offers fresh insights into both migration between Brazil and Japan and understandings of belonging, difference and attachment in transnational social spaces.	1	Paul Green

Ethnography	2010	3	Drawing on data generated from a six-year ethnographic study of one Wing Chun Kung Fu Association in England, this article explores the ways in which this martial art is constructed as a form of religion and functions as a secular religious practice for core members of this association. Two key features of this process are identified. The first involves the ways in which Wing Chun evolves from an everyday secular practice into something that takes on sacralized meanings for participants while the second focuses on the development of a Wing Chun habitus over time. The article closes with a discussion of how the findings relate to broader discussions of martial arts practices, religion and spirituality in Western cultures.	3	George Jennings; David Brown; Andrew C.

Forsey, Martin. 2010. 'Ethnography as Participant Listening.' Ethnography. 11:4 558-572.	Ethnography	2010	3	Anyone involved in ethnographic research knows that in practice participant listening is an important technique employed by ethnographers, particularly among those of us who live in an `interview society'; yet its importance is barely acknowledged in the ethnographic literature. It is curious that ethnographers seem not to have reflected much on a gap between what we say we do and our real life practice. Based partly on my own research into schools and schooling, alongside the work of various other practitioners, I argue the need to better acknowledge the importance of engaged listening for ethnography, and the ways in which personal style (visual learners versus aural learners) impacts ethnographic data production. I also examine the use of interviews in social research, exploring ways in which we might construe `the interview' conducted with an ethnographic imaginary as an `experience-near' event in Western settings: they offer truly ethnographic moments.	1	Martin Gerard Forsey

Gender \& Society	2010	9	Using the 1979-2006 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we investigate how the earnings bonus for fatherhood varies by characteristics associated with hegemonic masculinity in the American workplace: heterosexual marital status, professional/managerial status, educational attainment, skill demands of jobs, and race/ethnicity. We find the earnings bonus for fatherhood persists after controlling for an array of differences, including human capital, labor supply, family structure, and wives' employment status. Moreover, consistent with predictions from the theory of hegemonic masculinity within bureaucratic organizations, the fatherhood bonus is significantly larger for men with other markers of workplace hegemonic masculinity. Men who are white, married, in households with a traditional gender division of labor, college graduates, professional/managerial workers and whose jobs emphasize cognitive skills and deemphasize physical strength receive the largest fatherhood earnings bonuses.	2	Melissa J.

Maume, David, Rachel Sebastian & Anthony Bardo. 2010. 'Gender, Work-family Responsibilities, and Sleep.' Gender \& Society. 24:6 746-768.	Gender \& Society	2010	4	This study adds to a small but growing literature that situates sleep within gendered work-family responsibilities. We conducted interviews with 25 heterosexual dual-earner working-class couples with children, most of whom had one partner (usually the mother) who worked at night. A few men suffered disrupted sleep because of their commitment to being a coparent to their children, but for most their provider status gave them rights to longer and more continuous sleep. By contrast, as they were the primary caregiver during sentient hours, women's sleep was curtailed and interrupted by responding to the needs of family members at night and at the beginning of each day, and this was true for women who worked nights as well as days. Furthermore, in struggling to meet their daily employment and familial obligations while tired and sleepy, women further stressed their bodies in ways that can cause cumulative sleep debt. This article demonstrates that sleep deficits are another manifestation of gender inequality, with important implications for long-term health and well-being.	3	David J. Maume; Rachel A.

Winslow, Sarah. 2010. 'Gender Inequality and Time Allocations Among Academic Faculty.' Gender \& Society. 24:6 769-793.	Gender \& Society	2010	7	This article focuses on faculty members' allocation of time to teaching and research, conceptualizing these-and the mismatch between preferred and actual time allocations-as examples of gender inequality in academic employment. Utilizing data from the 1999 National Study of Postsecondary Faculty, I find that (1) women faculty members prefer to spend a greater percentage of their time on teaching, while men prefer to spend more time on research, although these preferences are themselves constrained; (2) women faculty members spend a greater percentage of their workweek on teaching and a smaller percentage on research than men, gaps that cannot be explained by preferences or educational and institutional attributes; and (3) women faculty members have larger time allocation mismatches than men-that is, their actual time allocations to both teaching and research diverge more from their preferred time allocations than those of men. These findings shed light on how gender inequality is both produced and maintained in this aspect of academic employment and have implications for job satisfaction, productivity, and the recruitment and retention of current and future faculty members, especially women.	1	Sarah Winslow
Bell, Shannon & Yvonne Braun. 2010. 'Coal, Identity, and the Gendering of Environmental Justice Activism in Central Appalachia.' Gender \& Society. 24:6 794-813.	Gender \& Society	2010	5	Women generally initiate, lead, and constitute the rank and file of environmental justice activism. However, there is little research on why there are comparatively so few men involved in these movements. Using the environmental justice movement in the Central Appalachian coalfields as a case study, we examine the ways that environmental justice activism is gendered, with a focus on how women's and men's identities both shape and constrain their involvement in gendered ways. The analysis relies on 20 interviews with women and men grassroots activists working for environmental justice in the coalfields of Appalachia. We find that women draw on their identities as ``mothers'' and ``Appalachians'' to justify their activism, while the hegemonic masculinity of the region, which is tied to the coal industry, has the opposite effect on men, deterring their movement involvement. We explore the implications of these findings for understanding the relationship of gender to environmental justice activism.	2	Shannon Elizabeth Bell; Yvonne A. Braun
Meadow, Tey. 2010. '``a Rose Is a Rose'' on Producing Legal Gender Classifications.' Gender \& Society. 24:6 814-837.	Gender \& Society	2010	1	Gender is perhaps the most pervasive, fundamental, and universally accepted way we separate and categorize human beings. Yet in recent years, U.S. courts and administrative state agencies have confronted a growing challenge from individuals demanding to have their gender reclassified. Transgender people create a profound category crisis for social institutions built on the idea that biological sex is both immutable and dichotomous. During the past four decades, the central legal question shifted from how to allocate specific individuals to categories to the permeability of gender categories themselves. This analysis of 38 judicial gender determinations provides a glimpse of the literal construction of the gender order and of the ways institutions gender individuals. It also provides powerful evidence that cultural anxieties about reproduction and the heterosexual, conjugal family underscore institutional efforts to manage the uncertainty of postmodern gender identities.	1	Tey Meadow
Portes, Alejandro, Rosa Aparicio, William Haller & Erik Vickstrom. 2010. 'Moving Ahead in Madrid: Aspirations and Expectations in the Spanish Second Generation1.' International Migration Review. 44:4 767-801.	International Migration Review	2010	6	This paper examines determinants of aspirations and expectations among children of immigrants based on a statistically representative sample of 3,375 second generation youths interviewed in 101 public and private secondary schools in metropolitan Madrid. We review the past literature on status attainment in general and aspirations and expectations, in particular, and draw from it a set of six hypotheses to guide the analysis. Most theoretical statements in this field have been developed on the basis of U.S. data; studies in other immigrant-receiving countries, especially outside the Anglophone world, have been scarce. The study thus provides an opportunity to test and refine existing hypotheses in a different national context. We present breakdowns of educational and occupational aspirations and expectations by gender, parental education and type of school attended. This is followed by multivariate regressions of all four dependent variables on these three plus other predictors suggested by the research literature. This analysis ends with structural equation models - recursive and non-recursive - that provide an integrated theoretical statement of the causal structure of ambition in the Spanish context. Implications of our findings for theory and policy are examined. Suggestions for future research in this field are discussed.	4	Alejandro Portes; Rosa Aparicio; William Haller; Erik Vickstrom
Connor, Phillip & Douglas Massey. 2010. 'Economic Outcomes Among Latino Migrants to Spain and the United States: Differences by Source Region and Legal Status.' International Migration Review. 44:4 802-829.	International Migration Review	2010	3	Using representative national surveys, this paper compares economic outcomes among Latin American migrants to Spain and the United States in the first cross-national comparison using quantitative data. Considering the geographic location and social proximity of each country with respect to Latin America, we detect a critical selection effect whereby the majority of Latin American migrants to Spain originate in South America from middle class backgrounds, whereas most migrants to the United States are Central Americans of lower class origins. This selection effect accounts for cross-national differences in the probability of employment, occupational attainment, and wages earned. Despite differences in the origins and characteristics of Latino immigrants to each country, demographic and human and social capital factors appear to operate similarly in both places; and when models are estimated separately by legal status, we find that effects are more accentuated for undocumented compared with documented migrants, especially in the United States.	2	Phillip Connor; Douglas S.

International Migration Review	2010	2	We evaluate recent revisions of assimilation theory by comparing the labor market performance of Mexican immigrants and their descendents to those of native white and black Americans. Using the Current Population Survey Contingent Worker Series, we examine public and non-standard employment and fringe benefits in addition to earnings. We find little evidence that Mexican Americans cluster in non-standard work, noting instead intergenerational improvement in benefits and pay. However, all Mexican-origin workers are disadvantaged relative to native whites in terms of benefits. It is only within the public sector that the labor market outcomes of Mexican-origin workers converge with native whites.	2	Renee Reichl Luthra; Roger Waldinger

International Migration Review. 44:4 869-898.	International Migration Review	2010	1	This paper examines the way immigrant earnings are determined in Australia. It uses the overeducation/required education/undereducation framework and a decomposition of the native-born/foreign-born differential in the payoff to schooling. This decomposition links overeducation to the less-than-perfect international transferability of immigrants' human capital, and undereducation to favorable selection in immigration. Comparisons are offered with findings from analyses for the U.S. and Canada to enable assessment of the relative impacts of favorable selection and the limited international transferability of human capital to the lower payoff to schooling for the foreign born. The sensitivity of the results of the decomposition to several measurement issues is assessed.	2	Barry R. Chiswick; Paul W. Miller

International Migration Review. 44:4 899-932.	International Migration Review	2010	7	We quantified determinants of international migratory inflows to 17 Western countries and outflows from 13 of these countries between 1950 and 2007 in 77,658 observations from multiple sources using panel-data analysis techniques. To construct a quantitative model that could be useful for demographic projection, we analyzed the logarithm of the number of migrants (inflows and outflows separately) as dependent variables in relation to demographic, geographic, and social independent variables. The independent variables most influential on log inflows were demographic [log population of origin and destination and log infant mortality rate (IMR) of origin and destination] and geographic (log distance between capitals and log land area of the destination). Social and historical determinants were less influential. For log outflows from the 13 countries, the most influential independent variables were log population of origin and destination, log IMR of destination, and log distance between capitals. A young age structure in the destination was associated with lower inflows while a young age structure in the origin was associated with higher inflows. Urbanization in destination and origin increased international migration. IMR affected inflows and outflows significantly but oppositely. Being landlocked, having a common border, having the same official language, sharing a minority language, and colonial links also had statistically significant but quantitatively smaller effects on international migration. Comparisons of models with different assumed correlation structures of residuals indicated that independence was the best assumption, supporting the use of ordinary-least-squares estimation techniques to obtain point estimates of coefficients.	2	Keuntae Kim; Joel E.

Burgoon, Brian, Janice Fine, Wade Jacoby & Daniel Tichenor. 2010. 'Immigration and the Transformation of American Unionism.' International Migration Review. 44:4 933-973.	International Migration Review	2010	0	Does immigration hamper union organizing in the United States? The prevailing literature strongly suggests that it does and for two reasons: first, immigrants increase the labor pool and diminish union influence over the labor market. And second, immigrants may be harder to organize than native workers. In this dominant view, unions are well served to restrict immigration and have always done so. But how, then, to explain the fact that American labor has long been deeply divided over the response to immigration? Drawing on new archival research and interviews, this paper uncovers a neglected side of American labor history in which many union leaders have extended solidarity to immigrants and sought to organize them. Moreover, analysis of time series data on immigration and union density corroborates the implicit theory of this alternate account of labor history: immigration has, in fact, no statistically significant effect - either positive or negative - on union density over time. Depending on specific conditions and strategies, unions can and have been successful in organizing during periods of high immigration.	4	Brian Burgoon; Janice Fine; Wade Jacoby; Daniel Tichenor

Those proposals concern the publishing of descriptive empirical research notes, meta-analysis review essays, detailed methodological information, arguments about causation, and analytical emphases on the substantive power of variables rather than mere statistical significance. The purpose and expected result of these proposed publishing adjustments is to increase the quality, value, and cumulative nature of the scholarship produced in the SSSR.	1	Christian Smith

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	10	This study examines the stability of religious preference among people who claim no religious preference in national surveys (i.e., religious nones). Using data from the Faith Matters Study, General Social Survey, and American National Election Study, we show that about 30 percent of religious nones in the first wave of the survey claim an affiliation with a religious group a year later. The percentage of religious nones remained stable in the two waves because a similar number of respondents moved in the opposite direction. Using various measures of religiosity, we show that most of these unstable nones report no significant change in religious belief or practice. We call them liminal nones as they stand halfway in and halfway out of a religious identity. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings on the controversies surrounding the rise of religious nones in recent years.	3	Chaeyoon Lim; Carol Ann MacGregor; Robert D. Putnam

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	4	Building off of Dean Kelley's and Laurence Iannaccone's earlier work, we develop a path model of the strictness thesis that investigates and compares how congregational strictness, evangelical theology, demographic characteristics, and denominational identity variously contribute to congregational growth and decline. Using the U. S. Congregational Life Survey (2001), we test this model at the congregational level and find significant support for the mechanisms at the core of both Kelley's and Iannaccone's versions of the strictness thesis, particularly that even after controlling for the other dynamics mentioned, congregational strictness has both an indirect and a direct positive effect on congregational growth. We also find, however, that evangelical theology, fertility, and denominational identity all play important roles in the prediction of growth, leading us to assert our integrated model as a new and more fully robust understanding of congregational growth and decline.	2	Jeremy N.

Whitehead, Andrew. 2010. 'Financial Commitment Within Federations of Small Groups: the Effect of Cell-based Congregational Structure on Individual Giving.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:4 640-656.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	2	According to available research, congregations with strict rules and dense social networks are better able to screen out free-riders (''selection'') and encourage greater levels of commitment among members (''production''). Both selection and production raise levels of individual giving. Research testing these processes generally utilizes a measure of network density. This study examines whether organizations that are a ``federation of small groups'' are better able to monitor members and hold them accountable, thus assuring acceptable levels of commitment on the part of members. Results of multilevel modeling using data from the 2001 U. S. Congregational Life Survey indicate that cell-based congregations elicit higher levels of financial giving among congregants, net of all other effects, including network density. Moreover, cross-level interactions between the cell-based congregation variable and theological exclusivity as well as attendance are significant and positive. Cell-based congregations provide a context in which individual-level predictors of giving become more robust.	1	Andrew L. Whitehead

Evidence From 26 Religious Markets in Europe and North America Between 1981 and 2006.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:4 657-672.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	3	This study tests the deregulation hypothesis of religious market theory in 26 European and Northern American countries by examining differences in religious involvement between and within countries. The deregulation hypothesis, which is assumed to be universally valid, predicts that religious involvement is higher in deregulated religious markets. Moreover, countries having deregulated religious markets for a longer period of time are supposed to have higher levels of involvement. Therefore, we test the duration hypothesis. This test is important, as it also has been argued that it may take time for deregulation to have an effect on religious involvement. Multilevel analysis on the stacked European and World Value Surveys of 1981, 1990, 2000, and 2006 show that deregulation fosters church attendance, but duration of deregulation does not increase church attendance. Although the deregulation hypothesis cannot be rejected, we find that modernization corrodes church attendance to a larger extent than deregulation can stimulate church attendance.	4	Olav Aarts; Manfred Te Grotenhuis; Ariana Need; Nan Dirk De
Hirschle, Jochen. 2010. 'From Religious to Consumption-related Routine Activities? Analyzing Ireland's Economic Boom and the Decline in Church Attendance.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:4 673-687.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	3	Using Ireland, which experienced an economic boom in the mid 1990s, as a case study, the negative association between economic growth and religious practice is examined by testing two competing hypotheses. Secularization theory argues that the cultural changes that accompany economic growth lead to a decline in religious values. As religious values diminish, so does attendance at religious services. An alternative explanation is that economic growth increases individual purchasing power and therefore consumption-related behavior. Consumption supplants religion by providing alternative intermediaries (symbols, infrastructures, and practices) for social behavior, but only marginally affects religious values. Using data from the 1988 to 2005 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP), analyses show that the economic boom in Ireland was clearly associated with a decline in religious attendance, while religious values remained stable. Thus, in Ireland the consequences of economic growth deviate from the predictions of secularization theory and therefore support the consumption argument.	1	Jochen Hirschle

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	0	Generally regarded as a rural phenomenon, the spread of religious revivalism in the Second Great Awakening may have also been associated with urbanization and early industrialism. This report of a secondary analysis of data originally collected by John Hammond (The Politics of Benevolence [1979]) provides support for the urban argument. Ordinary least-squares and Poisson regression analyses of the incidence of revivalism indicate that revivalism is associated with population size, township manufacturing, location in agricultural counties, and proximity to other towns experiencing revivals. Among urban places and manufacturing towns, the highest levels of revivalism are found in New York's western region. However, the results also uncover a strand of revivalism in the rural northern part of the state that cannot be reduced to the principal variables. The significance of these findings for the study of the Second Great Awakening and American evangelicalism broadly is highlighted.	1	Richard Lee Rogers

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:4 710-723.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	1	Prayer has increasingly been used as an empirical measure of religiosity. Recent developments include Ladd and Spilka's Inward, Outward and Upward Prayer Scale, which measures what respondents think about while praying, and Poloma and Pendleton's Measure of Prayer Type, which measures four different dimensions of prayer as well as degree of intimacy with the divine. The present study provides a factor analytical evaluation of both measures, including an examination of total scale and subscale reliability. The measures were administered to a sample of 518 Irish respondents. Although the total scales and subscales were found to be reliable, confirmatory factor analysis revealed that the hypothesized factor structures were a less than optimal fit of the data, while correlational analysis revealed a conceptual overlap between the measures.	3	Michael J.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	8	The study examines the indirect effects of religious fundamentalism on prejudice through cognitive style and fear of invalidity. Undergraduates (n = 199) completed measures of religious fundamentalism, homophobia, modern racism, hostile and benevolent sexism, need for cognition, need for structure, preference for consistency, and fear of invalidity. Need for cognition partially mediated the relationship between religious fundamentalism and both homophobia and benevolent sexism. Preference for consistency partially mediated the relationship between religious fundamentalism and hostile sexism. The indirect effect of religious fundamentalism on modern racism through preference for consistency approached statistical significance. The interaction between need for structure and fear of invalidity partially mediated the relationship between religious fundamentalism and both homophobia and hostile sexism, with individuals high in need for structure and low in fear of invalidity having higher religious fundamentalism and prejudice.	4	Eric D.

I test whether mortality differences associated with religious affiliation can be attributed to differences in socioeconomic status (years of education and household wealth), attendance at religious services, or health behaviors, particularly cigarette and alcohol consumption. A baseline report of attendance at religious services is used to avoid confounding effects of deteriorating health. Socioeconomic status explains some but not all of the mortality difference. While Catholics, evangelical Protestants, and black Protestants benefit from favorable attendance patterns, attendance (or lack of) at services explains much of the higher mortality of those with no religious preference. Health behaviors do not mediate the relationship between mortality and religion, except among evangelical Protestants. Not only does religion matter, but studies examining the effect of ``religiosity'' need to consider differences by religious affiliation.	1	Allison R. Sullivan
Ogland, Curtis, Thankam Sunil, John Bartkowski & Xiaohe Xu. 2010. 'Religious Influences on Teenage Childbearing Among Brazilian Female Adolescents: a Research Note.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:4 754-760.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	1	Scholars have shown increasing interest in the social implications of Protestant and, specifically, Pentecostal expansion in Latin America over the past several decades. This study uses data from the National Demographic and Health Survey in Brazil to explore the influence of religious affiliation and attendance on the reproductive behavior of unmarried female adolescents (ages 15-19). Results demonstrate that religiously affiliated female adolescents are less likely to have had a child during their teen years when compared with their unaffiliated peers. These protective effects are quite robust for adolescents who claim a Pentecostal affiliation, which is consistent with the doctrine of sanctification, including norms of sexual restraint. Results also demonstrate that teens who attend worship services frequently are significantly less likely to have had a child. These findings augment prior research on religion and fertility while calling attention to the protective effects associated with emergent niches in Brazil's increasingly diversified religious economy.	4	Curtis P.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	2	Despite the importance of young people in determining future trends in women's advancement in the predominantly Muslim countries of the Middle East, no quantitative study to date has focused exclusively on the relationship between Islamic religiosity and gender egalitarianism among youth in the region. Using data from the Youth, Emotional Energy, and Political Violence Survey, I investigate the relationship between Islamic religiosity and gender egalitarianism among youth in Saudi Arabia and Egypt, devoting special attention to gender differences within countries. Particular dimensions of Islamic religiosity have different effects on gender egalitarianism by group, reflecting social currents in each country's civic sphere. For young men in both contexts, orthodoxy and mosque attendance are negatively associated with gender egalitarianism. In contrast, for Egyptian young women self-identified religiosity positively affects gender egalitarianism while for Saudi Arabian women, Islamic religiosity has no effect.	1	Jaime Kucinskas

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	2	This article considers the ways in which power and gender are practiced in the interactional situations of interview refusals in organizational research. The research draws on two episodes of male telemarketers' refusals in the context of call centers. Utilizing an ethnographic approach together with nonparticipant observations enabled the analysis of the interview refusals while providing valid and informative data. By arguing that gender is filtered into the interaction particularly through power negotiations and actualized for the most part in conflict between the female researcher and the male participants, the article offers an example of how gender can shape and influence the data collection process.	1	Tuija Koivunen
Avison, William. 2010. 'Incorporating Children's Lives Into a Life Course Perspective on Stress and Mental Health.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:4 361-375.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	6	Emerging themes in demography, developmental medicine, and psychiatry suggest that a comprehensive understanding of mental health across the life course requires that we incorporate the lives of children into our research. If we can learn more about the ways in which the stress process unfolds for children, we will gain important insights into the factors that influence initial set points of trajectories of mental health over the life course. This will simultaneously extend the scope of the stress process paradigm and elaborate the life course perspective on mental health. Incorporating children's lives into the sociology of mental health will also extend the intellectual influence of the discipline on sociomedical and biomedical research on mental illness. I contend that sociology's greatest promise in understanding trajectories of mental health across the life course lies in a systematic analysis of the social and social-psychological conditions of children, the stressful experiences that arise out of these conditions, and the processes that mediate and moderate the stress process in childhood. In this regard, there are three major issues that sociologists could begin to address: (1) the identification of structural and institutional factors that pattern children's exposure to stress; (2) the construction of a stress universe for children; and (3) the identification of key elements of the life course perspective that may set or alter trajectories of mental health in childhood and adolescence.	1	William R.

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	9	China has been experiencing pronounced changes in its sex ratio, but little research has explored the consequences of these changes for sexual behavior and health. We merge data from the 1999-2000 Chinese Health and Family Life Survey with community-level data from the 1982, 1990, and 2000 Chinese censuses to examine the relationship between the local sex ratio and several dimensions of men's sexual behavior and sexual health. Multilevel logistic regression models show that, when faced with a relative abundance of age-matched women in their community, Chinese men are slightly less likely to have intercourse with commercial sex workers, but are more likely to engage in premarital noncommercial intercourse and to test positive for a sexually transmitted infection. These findings are consistent with hypotheses derived from demographic-opportunity theory, which suggests that an abundance of opposite-sex partners will increase the risk of early, frequent, and multi-partner sex and, through this, sexually transmitted infection risk.	2	Scott J.

Ueno, Koji. 2010. 'Mental Health Differences Between Young Adults With and Without Same-sex Contact: a Simultaneous Examination of Underlying Mechanisms.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:4 391-407.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	1	Previous research has documented that sexual minorities are more likely than heterosexual people to experience mental health problems, but little is known about how these disparities emerge. Analysis of data from Miami-Dade County, Florida, shows that young adults reporting same-sex contact have higher levels of depressive symptoms and drug use than those without such contact, but that different processes explain the disparities in the two outcomes. A substantial portion of the gap in depressive symptoms is explained by sexual minorities' higher levels of stress exposure and their lower levels of family support and psychological resources. The gap in drug use is not explained by these processes, but is partially explained by self-exploratory attitudes and permissiveness of drug use in social networks. This study highlights the importance of using multiple outcome measures in research that examines mechanisms underlying mental health disparities across social groups.	1	Koji Ueno

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	29	What are the social consequences of the recent expansion of newborn screening in the United States? The adoption of new screening technologies has generated diagnostic uncertainty about the nature of screening targets, making it unclear not only whether a newborn will develop a disease but also what the condition actually is. Based on observations in a genetics clinic and in-depth interviews with parents and geneticists, we examine how parents and clinical staff work out the social significance of uncertain newborn screening results. We find that some newborns will experience a specific trajectory of prolonged liminality between a state of normal health and pathology. Based on a review of related literatures, we suggest ``patients-in-waiting'' as an umbrella concept for those under medical surveillance between health and disease.	2	Stefan Timmermans; Mara Buchbinder

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	7	Much research has explored the role of social networks in promoting health through the provision of social support. However, little work has examined how social networks themselves may be structured by health. This article investigates the link between individuals' health and the characteristics of their social network positions. We first develop theoretical predictions for how health may influence the structure of adolescent networks. We then test these predictions using longitudinal analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health). We find important relationships between the health status of adolescents and the characteristics of the social network positions within which they are embedded. Overall we find that adolescents in poor health form smaller local networks and occupy less central global positions than their healthy peers. These results also have implications for social network research, expanding the scope of factors responsible for the network positions individuals occupy.	3	Steven A. Haas; David R.

Gorman, Bridget, Jen'nan Read & Patrick Krueger. 2010. 'Gender, Acculturation, and Health Among Mexican Americans.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:4 440-457.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	12	This study examines whether the relationship between acculturation and physical health varies by gender among Mexican Americans, and if the mechanisms that mediate the acculturation-health relationship operate differently by gender. Using the 1998-2007 National Health Interview Study, we construct a composite measure of acculturation and estimate regression models for the total number of health conditions, hypertension, heart disease, and diabetes. Immigrants with the lowest levels of acculturation are the healthiest, but this association is stronger for men. Medical care plays a central role in accounting for gender and acculturation differences across health outcomes-increased access to and utilization of medical care is associated with worse health, which suggests that better health among recent arrivals (particularly men) partially results from their lack of knowledge about their own poor health.	3	Bridget K.

Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:4 458-477.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	6	We analyze data from the South African Stress and Health Study, a nationally representative in-person psychiatric epidemiologic survey of 4,351 adults conducted as part of the World Mental Health Survey Initiative between January 2002 and June 2004. All blacks (Africans, Coloreds, and Indians) initially report higher levels of non-specific distress and anger/hostility than whites. Access to socioeconomic resources helps explain differences in non-specific distress between Coloreds and whites and Indians and whites. However, only when social stressors are considered do we find few differences in psychological distress (i.e., non-specific distress and anger/hostility) between Africans and whites. In addition, self-esteem and mastery have independent effects on non-specific distress and anger/hostility, but differences between Coloreds and whites in feelings of anger/hostility are not completely explained by self-esteem and mastery. The findings contribute to the international body of work on social stress theory, challenge underlying assumptions of the minority status perspective, and raise a series of questions regarding mental health disparities among South Africans.	6	Pamela Braboy Jackson; David R.

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	7	Just as postsecondary schooling serves as a dividing line between the advantaged and disadvantaged on outcomes like income and marital status, it also serves as a dividing line between the healthy and unhealthy. Why are the better educated healthier? Human capital theory posits that education makes one healthier via cognitive (skill improvements) and noncognitive psychological resources (traits such as conscientiousness and a sense of mastery). I employ the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (1957-2005) to test the relative strength of measures of cognitive human capital versus noncognitive psychological human capital in explaining the relationship between education and health outcomes among high school graduates. I find little evidence that noncognitive psychological human capital is a significant mediator, but find a relatively significant role for cognitive human capital, as measured by high school academic performance. It is not just higher educational attainment; academic performance is strongly linked to health in later life.	1	Pamela Herd
Dochartaigh, Niall & Lorenzo Bosi. 2010. 'Territoriality and Mobilization: the Civil Rights Campaign in Northern Ireland.' Mobilization. 15:4 405-424.	Mobilization	2010	0	This article assesses how the concept of territoriality can expand our understanding of the relationship between space and political mobilization. While the spatial aspects of social movement mobilization have received increased attention over the last decade, the specifically territorial aspects of mobilization remain undertheorized. This article elaborates on Sack's (1986) characterization of territoriality as a means to exert power by delimiting area. We analyze territoriality's role in the civil rights campaign in Northern Ireland through the late 1960s. The empirical analysis indicates that significant campaign power was rooted in the territorial boundaries and contexts that were deployed in the course of mobilization. Our intent in introducing the concept of territoriality is threefold: first, to help explain how mobilization is interwoven, through agency, with local context; second, to emphasize the utility of spatial concepts in the social movement literature; and third, to broaden the comparative range of case studies in the field of collective action by considering societies where boundaries are actively contested (weakly ``naturalized''). We conclude with a discussion of how the concept of territoriality enhances a new reading of our empirical case and an analysis of the study's theoretical implications for our understanding of the relationship between mobilization and boundaries.	2	Niall O.

Mobilization	2010	16	Researchers studying Internet activism have disagreed over the extent to which Internet usage alters the processes driving collective action, and therefore also over the utility of existing social movement theory. We argue that some of this disagreement owes to scholars studying different kinds of Internet activism. Therefore, we introduce a typology of Internet activism, which shows that markedly different findings are associated with different types of Internet activism and that some types of Internet activism have been studied far more frequently than others. As a consequence, we ask an empirical question: is this skew in the selection of cases, and hence apparent trends in findings, a reflection of the empirical frequency of different types of Internet activism? Troublingly, using unique data from random samples of websites discussing 20 different issue areas commonly associated with social movements, we find a mismatch between trends in research cases studied and empirical frequency.	5	Jennifer Earl; Katrina Kimport; Greg Prieto; Carly Rush; Kimberly Reynoso
Ho, Ming-sho. 2010. 'Co-opting Social Ties: How the Taiwanese Petrochemical Industry Neutralized Environmental Opposition.' Mobilization. 15:4 447-463.	Mobilization	2010	2	This article seeks to understand how social ties can be manipulated by industrial producers in such a way that local opposition to pollution is neutralized. Social movement researchers argue that mobilization cannot proceed without pre-existing social ties, and further reflection suggests the nature of social ties is tremendously consequential. Clientelist ties are characterized by mass dependence and cooperation as beneficiaries expect favors from above. Thus, when clientelist leaders are politically excluded, a strong community-based protest is likely to take place under their leadership. However, if clientelist leaders are incorporated to share the benefits of industrial development, the result is likely to be community acquiescence even though popular grievances are endemic. This paper analyzes Taiwan's environmental politics since the late-1980s by focusing on how material compensations incorporated the previously excluded politicians. Elites thus played the role of redistributors and brokers, rather than protest leaders, and consequently, popular discontent over pollution was contained.	1	Ming-sho Ho

Mobilization	2010	1	Research on state repression of protest focuses on two key factors: threat and weakness. States repress protest events when they threaten state authorities and social norms (threat), when they lack organizational strength and political voice (weakness), or when they do both. I test these competing explanations in the context of Western European protests from 1975 to 1989. This analysis goes beyond previous research by exploring the effect of threat and weakness in multiple domestic contexts. The findings suggest that threat is the most powerful explanation of repression, whereas weakness only occasionally predicts repression and depends on country-specific contexts. The importance of the findings lie in their ability to emphasize (1) the universality of situational threat to police ``on-the-ground'' over theories that view a calculating state ``up-above,'' and (2) the seemingly unified perception (in advanced democracies) of protest as an increasingly legitimate form of political participation that does not beget repression.	1	Phillip M.

Mobilization	2010	2	Scholars have argued that since the 1960s, protest policing in Western democracies has moved toward emphasizing cooperative relationships with challenging groups. This evolution is referred to as the negotiated management model of protest control. Much of the literature that informs this perspective is based on either analyses of a limited subset of demonstrations or from national-level observation. Few studies have examined whether negotiated management practices hold at city levels. This research examines city-level protest policing using 1,152 demonstrations occurring between 1998 and 2004 in Montreal, Toronto, and Vancouver, Canada. Bayesian logistic regression models are estimated using arrests as the response variable. The main findings suggest that only protestor premobilization and the police use of force are uniformly related to arrests; that there is considerable variation across cities; and that the larger pattern of results is not consistent with negotiated management practices.	1	Patrick Rafail

Mobilization	2010	0	Social movements are arenas where individuals can voice concerns about politics, culture, and social change. Movements work to create frames and collective identities that resonate with the public and bind participants together. However, movement participants are not always completely free to cultivate and adopt frames and identities. The emergence of countermovements, in particular, can fundamentally affect these tactics. However, we find that frame and identity resonance can also be influenced by other factors and conditions. We explore these issues based on participant observation and interviews with activists at two ongoing anti-Iraq war protests and one ongoing pro-invasion protest, both of which occurred over a three-month period in early 2003. We find that local context, movement-countermovement dynamics, the ability to assuage oppositional challenges, and intra-movement unity and cooperation shape overall movement trajectories and success.	2	Sharon S.

Schultz, Jennifer & Ronald Breiger. 2010. 'the Strength of Weak Culture.' Poetics. 38:6, SI 610-624.	Poetics	2010	3	The theoretical work of Granovetter on the strength of weak social ties needs to be extended to the study of cultural objects and relations. The tie that binds an actor to a cultural taste might be strong (purposive, intensive in time or commitment, fostered by a tightly integrated community bound by social symbols and representations) or weak (banal, non-instrumental, non-demanding, non-exclusive). Weak culture can be ``strong'' in several different respects. We elucidate various possibilities and conundrums: whether weak culture bridges across otherwise disconnected social groups, or bonds actors to a wider collectivity than is possible on the basis of strong-culture commitments; weak culture as signifying elaborated (as opposed to restricted) genre codes, versus the moderation of genre commitments; and weak culture as enabling publics and institutional domains as well as enabling movement across domains. Then, in analysis of items from the US General Social Survey Culture Module (1993; N = 1606), we illustrate the strength of weak culture (operationalized as ``liking'' versus ``loving'' musical genres) in producing perceptions of an integrated national society.	2	Jennifer Schultz; Ronald L.

Population Research and Policy Review	2010	1	Using large nationally representative longitudinal data on changes in happiness and mortality and multivariate increment-decrement life tables, we assess length of quality life through cohort estimates of happy life expectancies. We examine population-based and status-based life expectancies in absolute term of years and relative term of proportions. We find that happy life expectancies exceed unhappy life expectancies in both absolute and relative terms for the overall population and population in each state of happiness at any given age. Being happy (as opposed to unhappy) at any age brings a longer life and more of the future life spent in happiness. We also examine social differentials in the estimates of happy life expectancy at each age by sex, race, and education. The educational gap in happy life expectancies is larger than the sex and race gaps. For the better educated, longer life consists of a longer happy life and shorter unhappy life in both years and proportions and regardless of happy or unhappy status at any given age.	2	Yang Yang; Muhammad Waliji
Swanson, David & Jerome McKibben. 2010. 'New Directions in the Development of Population Estimates in the United States?.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:6 797-818.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	4	The advent of a continuously updated Master Area File (MAF) following the 2000 census represents an information resource that can be tapped for purposes of developing timely, cost-effective, and precise population estimates for even the smallest of geographical units (e.g., census blocks). We argue that the MAF can be enhanced (EMAF) for these purposes. In support of our argument we describe a set of activities needed to develop EMAF, each of which is well within the current capabilities of the U.S. Census Bureau and discuss various costs and benefits of each. We also describe how EMAF would provide population estimates containing a wide range of demographic (e.g., age, race, and sex) and socio-economic characteristics (e.g., educational attainment, income, and employment). As such, it could largely negate and eliminate the need for many of the traditional demographic methods of population estimation and possibly reduce the number of sample surveys. We identify important challenges that must be surmounted in order to realize EMAF and make suggestions for doing so. We conclude by noting that the idea of the EMAF could be of interest to other countries with MAF files and strong administrative records systems that, like the United States, are facing the challenge of producing good population information in the face of increasing census costs.	2	David A.

Thomas, Kevin. 2010. 'Family Contexts and Schooling Disruption Among Orphans in Post-genocide Rwanda.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:6 819-842.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	1	This study examines the relationship between orphan status and schooling disruption in post-genocide Rwanda. The results indicate that while non-orphans have more favorable schooling outcomes in two-parent than in single-parent families, the reverse is true among Rwandan orphans. In single-mother households, paternal orphans, i.e. orphans with only a living mother, have better outcomes than their orphan and non-orphan counterparts. In contrast, paternal orphans have worse outcomes than other children in two-parent households, especially in households headed by males. Maternal orphans are more likely to experience schooling disruptions than non-orphans regardless of family structure. The maternal-orphan disadvantage is nevertheless greater in female-headed than in male-headed households. As expected, non-related orphans are more disadvantaged than orphans related to their household heads. However, non-related orphans have a greater disadvantage in two-parent than in single-parent households. The results also suggest that within households, the provision of childcare to children below schooling age is an impediment to orphan's schooling. These impediments are, however, greater for double-orphans than paternal or maternal orphans.	1	Kevin J. Thomas

Population Research and Policy Review. 29:6 843-864.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	1	Using survey data from Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) recipients in Madison County, New York, we evaluate the effectiveness of the EITC in improving the economic well-being of low-income households. In particular, we examine the impact of the EITC across household types. For tax years 2002 through 2004, we find that the EITC is responsible for significantly lowering the poverty rate of EITC recipients, from 57 to 49\%. In fact, for households below the poverty line, the EITC fills 31\% of the gap between their adjusted gross income and the poverty line. The EITC has the largest impact on single parent households, lowering their poverty rate by 11.2 percentage points and reducing their poverty gap by almost 35\%. However, the EITC has negligible effects on the poorest households in the sample-childless singles. A majority (64\%) of EITC recipients intends to use at least some of the refund on basic needs and almost half plan on using part of their refund for debt repayment. This suggests that the EITC helps the majority of recipients get by but does not increase their economic mobility. Somewhat surprisingly, single parent households in the sample are not that different from married parent households in terms of EITC amounts, poverty rates, use of credit, and participation in government programs, despite earning less.	3	Nicole B.

Ma, Sai & Brian Finch. 2010. 'Birth Outcome Measures and Infant Mortality.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:6 865-891.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	2	Recent studies have proposed alternative birth outcome measures as means of assessing infant mortality risk; nevertheless, there hasn't yet been an integrated analysis of these approaches. We review 14 strategies, including various combinations of birth weight, gestational age, fetal growth rate, and Apgar scores-as predictors of early neonatal, late neonatal, and postneonatal mortality, and infant mortality. Using the NCHS linked birth/infant death file for 2001, we construct multivariate logit models and assess the associations between each of the 14 key birth outcome measures and four mortality outcomes. We find that all evaluated birth outcome measures are strong predictors, but Apgar scores are the strongest among all models for all outcomes, independent of birth weight and gestational age. Apgar scores' predictive power is stronger for Mexican-, white-, and female-infants than for black- and male-infants. Second, all birth outcome measures remain significantly associated with mortality, but their predictive power reduces drastically over time. These findings suggest a rule of thumb for predicting infant mortality odds: when available, Apgar scores should always be included along with birth weight (or LBW status) and gestational age. Additionally, these findings argue for the continued study of low birthweight, gestational age, and Apgar scores as independently salient health outcomes.	2	Sai Ma; Brian Karl Finch

Population Research and Policy Review	2010	6	As the baby boom cohorts expand the number of U.S. retirees, population estimates of the employment, withdrawal and reentry behaviors of older Americans' remain scarce. How long do people work? How frequently is retirement reversed? How many years are people retired? What is the modal age of retirement? And, how do the patterns for women compare to those for men? Using the 1992-2004 Health and Retirement Study, we estimate multistate working life tables to update information on the age-graded regularities of the retirement life course of men and women in the United States. We find that at age 50 men can expect to spend half of their remaining lives working for pay, while women can expect to spend just one-third. Half of all men and women have left the labor force by ages 63 and 61, respectively. Although the majority of retirement exits are final, variation in the nature and duration of the retirement process is substantial, as about a third of men's and women's exits are reversed. By quantifying these patterns for men and women, we provide a sound empirical basis for evaluating policy designed to address the financial pressures population aging places on public and private pension systems.	3	David F.

Dey, Ian & Fran Wasoff. 2010. 'Another Child? Fertility Ideals, Resources and Opportunities.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:6 921-940.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	0	Low fertility in most developed countries has prompted policy concern in relation to labour market supply, pensions, and expenditure on health and welfare services as well as policy debate about both the cost of children and the opportunity costs of parenthood. The extent to which family policy interventions can be effective in slowing or reversing fertility decline is much debated. This paper, based on a fertility module of the Scottish Social Attitudes Survey 2005, examines the current fertility, and ideal and expected fertility of a nationally representative sample of 455 parents of reproductive age and focuses on whether they plan to have another child. It compares the characteristics of those who intend to have another child with those who do not, and how parents with one child differ from those with more children. It addresses three questions about family size: (1) fertility ideals, (2) resources and the economic implications of childbearing, and (3) opportunities for childbearing and the effects of a late start on fertility expectations. It concludes that, despite a sustained period of low fertility in Scotland, childbearing ideals are robust and explanations of low fertility must derive from difficulties in realising those ideals. Difficulties in realising fertility aspirations are associated less with resources than with opportunities for childbearing, especially the timing of first birth. Those who delay their first birth are less likely to realise their ideal family size, and their lower fertility is associated with the opportunity costs of childbearing in terms of foregone qualifications, careers and earnings.	2	Ian Dey; Fran Wasoff

Qualitative Sociology	2010	2	In contemporary art, the curator plays an important role in the production of artistic meaning through exhibition-making. Although sociology has tended to see this work as the exercise of tacit or embodied knowledge, curatorial knowledge and plans may be elaborated and altered by the situated actions of exhibition installation. While curators know a successful installation ``when they see it,'' this depends on the indexical particularities of artworks and environments which cannot be predicted in advance. In demonstrating the practical ways in which culture is mobilized in situations of object (inter) action, this paper emphasizes the ``making'' in artistic meaning-making.	1	Sophia Krzys Acord
Pagis, Michal. 2010. 'From Abstract Concepts to Experiential Knowledge: Embodying Enlightenment in a Meditation Center.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:4, SI 469-489.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	3	How do abstract philosophies turn into lived reality? Based on 2 years of ethnographic observations and in-depth interviews of vipassana meditation practitioners in Israel and the United States, the paper follows the process through which meditators embody the three main Buddhist tenets: dissatisfaction, impermanence and not-self. While meditators consider these tenets central to Buddhist philosophy, it is only through the practice of meditation that the tenets are experienced on the bodily level and thereby are ``realized'' as truth. This realization takes place in the situated environment of the meditation center, where participation in long meditation retreats facilitates the production of specific subjective experiences that infuse the knowledge of Buddhist tenets with embodied meaning. The paper illustrates how abstract concepts and embodied experience support one another in the construction of meditators' phenomenological reality and suggests a general framework for studying the variety of relations that exist between the conceptual and embodied dimensions of different types of knowledge.	1	Michal Pagis
Whooley, Owen. 2010. 'Organization Formation as Epistemic Practice: the Early Epistemological Function of the American Medical Association.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:4, SI 491-511.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	2	This research explores how social actors adjudicate knowledge claims within intellectual environments where epistemic standards are contested. Through the case study of 19th century debates over cholera in the United States, I examine the strategies deployed by orthodox and homeopathic physicians in the struggle over medical knowledge during this ``epistemic contest.'' The 1832 cholera epidemic ushered in a crisis for orthodox medicine, as epistemological standards for adjudicating medical knowledge claims became challenged and ill-defined. Failing to muster an effective cultural response to homeopathy, orthodoxy adopted an organizational strategy, forming the American Medical Association and offering professional membership as a proxy indicator of legitimate knowledge. The AMA created an organizational/intellectual space insulated from homeopathy, which translated into a concerted campaign to exclude homeopaths from government institutions and affected the nature of orthodox knowledge on cholera. This case reveals that epistemic contests are not waged by cultural means only; organizational practices form an integral part of actors' repertoires in adjudicating epistemological claims in practice.	1	Owen Whooley
Malor, Chantelle. 2010. 'Bureaucracy, Democracy and Exclusion: Why Indigenous Knowledge Holders Have a Hard Time Being Taken Seriously.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:4, SI 513-531.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	0	This paper explores inherent tensions between two democratic ideals: citizen representation and accountability of the state. Specifically, I argue that the method by which state officials make themselves accountable through their creation of the appearance of transparency results in the exclusion of alternative, non-scientific ways of knowing, including those that are gendered, local and indigenous, because these ways of knowing often employ non-standardized methods which are not ``transparent'' in the same way as science and therefore easily dismissed by state officials as indefensible to citizens' questioning. I explore this tension by drawing on examples from ethnographic work I completed with two groups of knowledge practitioners, Kwakwaka'wakw First Nations (Native American) traditional marine harvesters and government biologists, both of whom work with clams.	1	Chantelle Malor
Krause, Monika. 2010. 'Accounting for State Intervention: the Social Histories of ``beneficiaries''.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:4, SI 533-547.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	1	How does the state imagine the people? In what ways does it come to know the targets of its policies? This paper examines the transformation of the state through a focus on the visions implied in tools and practices of results-based management in state bureaucracies. When scholars have discussed the state's vision or imagination they have often critically examined how the state constructs aggregates of the population as a whole. But an emphasis on or critique of aggregation can only be the beginning of understanding the multiple and sometimes contradictory ways in which people are imagined in governance today. Results-based management has created a new way in which the state imagines people. In some policy arenas citizens have been turned into ``beneficiaries'' through the practices of state managers. Beneficiaries differ from citizen in a number of ways: Citizens are thought to benefit from policies with broad goals; beneficiaries are shown to benefit from specific interventions. Citizens are owed service; beneficiaries are selected for intervention if it suits specific funding priorities. Citizens are the origins of politics and the end of policies; beneficiaries are a means to an organization's success.	1	Monika Krause

Qualitative Sociology	2010	1	This research note uses in-depth interviews, ethnographic observations, and archival records to examine the self-understandings of think tank-affiliated policy experts. I argue that policy experts draw on a series of idioms those of the academic scholar, the political aide, the entrepreneur, and the media specialist to construct a unique albeit synthetic professional identity. The essence of the policy expert's role lies in a continuous effort to balance and reconcile the contradictory imperatives associated with these idioms. An analysis of the policy expert's mixed ``professional psyche'' offers a useful point of entry into the objective social structure of the think tank.	1	Thomas Medvetz

Review of Religious Research	2010	3	This study examines demographic and denominational differences in religious involvement (organizational, non-organizational, subjective) among Caribbean Blacks (Black Caribbeans) residing in the U.S.A. using data from the National Survey of American Life. Caribbean Blacks who were born in the U.S. had lower levels of religious involvement than those who immigrated, and respondents originating from Haiti (as compared to Jamaica) had higher levels of religious involvement, while persons from Trinidad-Tobago reported lower service attendance than did Jamaicans. Older persons, women, and married persons generally demonstrated greater religious involvement than their counterparts, while highly educated respondents expressed lower levels of self-rated religiosity Denominational differences indicated that Baptists reported high levels of religious involvement; however, in several cases, Pentecostals and Seventh Day Adventists reported greater involvement.	4	Robert Joseph Taylor; Linda M.

Brown, R.. 2010. 'Religion, Economic Concerns, and African American Immigration Attitudes.' Review of Religious Research. 52:2 146-158.	Review of Religious Research	2010	1	The present study assesses the relationship between exposure to political cues from clergy and African American immigration attitudes. At first glance, these findings suggest that the more political messages that African Americans hear from their clergy, the more critical they are of the immigrant presence. However, a more careful look at the data suggests that these political messages only sway the immigration attitudes of those who are worried about their own or the nation's economic well being. This may suggest that economically concerned African Americans are particularly sensitive to political cues that emphasize policies, immigration being among them, that may threaten African American life chances.	1	R.

Yancey, George. 2010. 'Who Has Religious Prejudice? Differing Sources of Anti-religious Animosity in the United States.' Review of Religious Research. 52:2 159-171.	Review of Religious Research	2010	1	Research indicates that older, less educated, politically conservative, and highly religious individuals are disproportionately likely to exhibit animosity because of race, sex, and sexuality. But little work explores animosity towards traditionally oriented social groups, such as religious conservatives. Theories about the unique characteristics of those possessing animosity predicts little animosity from progressives against fundamentalists while the theory of ethnocentrism predicts that progressives possess animosity towards fundamentalists as a social out-group. I use the National Elections Survey to document the degree of animosity a variety of religious groups face and who is likely to exhibit that animosity. In particular I investigate whether animosity towards conservative social groups comes from similar sources as animosity towards progressive social groups. Animosity towards atheists is higher than towards other religious groups, but the level of animosity towards fundamentalists is not trivial. Regression analysis indicates that political progressiveness and educational attainment, two factors predicting tolerance toward progressive religious groups, is positively correlated with animosity towards fundamentalists. Animosity towards religious conservatives may manifest itself differently than animosity towards progressive social groups due to contrasting characteristics of those possessing it.	1	George Yancey
Acevedo, Gabriel. 2010. 'Collective Rituals or Private Practice in Texas? Assessing the Impact of Religious Factors on Mental Health.' Review of Religious Research. 52:2 188-206.	Review of Religious Research	2010	0	A growing body of literature addresses the linkages between religion and mental health. While the preponderance of the empirical evidence points to positive effects that religious variables have on mental health, less is known about the specific mechanisms that may explain this recurrent religion-mental health link. Using a random sample of adults in the state of Texas, a social capital perspective is applied and ordered logistic regression techniques used to determine the impact of religion/religiosity variables on mental health. Specifically, the study contrasts individualistic and collectivist forms of religious expression and argues that it is the nature of the religious phenomenon under consideration and not religiosity per se which has the most direct impact on mental health. Findings suggest that collectivist religious practices like church attendance and participation in church related activities are linked to positive mental health outcomes. Conversely, individualistic practices, as measured by consumption of religious media, prayer, and reading of scripture, seem to be associated with lower measures of overall mental health. Implications for the religious social capital perspective are discussed.	1	Gabriel A. Acevedo

Review of Religious Research	2010	0	This study computed the percentage changes recorded on six separate performance indicators between 1991 and 2000 in order to calculate the effect of the Decade of Evangelism on the mainland dioceses of the Church of England. The performance indicators were usual Sunday attendance, Easter Sunday communicants, Christmas communicants, electoral roll membership, total baptism figures, and total confirmation figures. Statistical procedures (including cluster analysis, analysis of variance, canonical correlation analysis, and multiple regression) were then employed in order to identify from the range of variables routinely collected by the central church authorities policy-related factors associated with church growth (or at least reduced decline) over this period. These analyses identified four areas, concerned with expanding non-stipendiary ministry, with encouraging the ordination of women, with resisting church closure, and with promoting a financial policy that includes planned subscriptions and charitable giving. These conclusions are offered as an applied example of using statistics as a tool for mission and as the basis for evidence-based policy.	3	Leslie J. Francis; Patrick Laycock; Andrew Village
Lam, Pui-Yan. 2010. 'Bound by Denominational Ties: Dilemmas of Asian Ministry in the Episcopal Church.' Review of Religious Research. 51:2 134-155.	Review of Religious Research	2010	0	Previous ethnographic studies have noted that Asian-American churches tend to be non-denominational or loosely linked to their denominations. Yet, the question why Asian American congregations lack denominational ties remains unanswered. This research attempts to address the question through the experience of Asian immigrants in the Episcopal Church. I collected data from (1) participant observation at the annual conference of the Asian American Ministry in the Episcopal Church (known as the Episcopal Asiamerica Ministry) in 2002, 2003 and 2004, (2) in-depth interviews with individuals active in Asian-American ministry at congregational, diocesan, and national levels, and (3) documents, news articles, and reports from church archives. I examine some of the dilemmas that clergy and lay leaders in Asian ministry face as they struggle to balance between the demands of the denominations and the needs of their constituencies. Moreover, the hierarchical structure of the denomination may delay the establishment of new immigrant congregations and impose restrictions on the selection of location and clergy. This adds various costs to the development of Asian ministry and diminishes benefits (such as a sense of belonging) that members of immigrant congregations receive.	1	Pui-Yan Lam
Merrill, Ray, Randy Baker, Lisa Gren & Joseph Lyon. 2010. 'Health and Missionary Service Among Senior Couples in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.' Review of Religious Research. 51:2 156-165.	Review of Religious Research	2010	0	The purpose of this study is to quantify the extent that health influences participation in missionary service among seniors in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. A retrospective cohort study was conducted based on claims and enrollment data from the Deseret Mutual Benefit Administrators (DMBA) database for the years 1997 through 2005. Church missionary records were linked to the DMBA database. Claims rates and costs per visit are presented for the year immediately prior to missionary service and compared with earlier years for doctor office visits and services, pharmacy claims, diabetes, mental illness (anxiety/depression), inpatient hospitalization, cancer, and heart disease. Claims rates and costs per visit are also compared between missionary and non-missionary groups. Among those who go on to serve a mission, superior health exists in the year prior to missionary service compared with earlier years. More importantly, better health status is observed in the missionary group in earlier years compared with the non-missionary control group, suggesting religious activity in the Years prior to missionary preparation positively affects health.	4	Ray M.

Calfano, Brian. 2010. 'Assessing Context and Ideology on the Behavior of Denominational Bureaucrats.' Review of Religious Research. 51:2 166-180.	Review of Religious Research	2010	0	Though the behavior of American congregational clergy has long received scholarly attention, a similar assessment of those in the denominational bureaucracy has languished I begin to remedy this by testing the usefulness of two dominant theoretical lenses that have proven successful in understanding clergy activity at the congregational level. The first, referred to here as the preference approach, assumes that bureaucratic activity like that of their congregational counterparts, is largely the result of personal ideology. The second, referred to here as the contextual approach, draws on work that has situated congregational pastors in their larger professional settings to lease out the effects of work groups and community on elite activity. Using data from a recent survey of bureaucrats in the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), I find that indicators associated with the contextual approach are more consistent predictors of bureaucratic activity than ideology This suggests that future studies of denominational bureaucrats should be conducted with an eve toward the contextual realities that these religious elites confront.	1	Brian Robert Calfano

Review of Religious Research	2010	0	This study has two principal aims. The first goal is to evaluate empirically new measures of close companion friendships that arise in church. The second goal is to embed these measures in a conceptual model that seeks to assess the relationship between close companion friends at church and health. Based on data from a nationwide sample of older people, the findings reveal that the newly devised measures are psychometrically, sound. In addition, the results provide empirical support for the following linkages that are contained in our conceptual model: older-people who have a close companion friend at church are more likely to feel they belong in their congregation; old adults who believe they belong in their congregation are more likely to feel grateful to God; and older individuals who feel grateful to God tend to rate their health more favorably.	2	Neal Krause; John Cairney

Review of Religious Research	2010	0	The interconnection between fundamentalism beliefs, spirituality, and four inlet-related dimensions of empathy (empathic concern, personal distress, perspective-taking, and fantasy abilities) remains relatively unexplored at this time. As such, the purpose of this project is to establish whether or not the four different aspects of empathy are related to religious fundamentalism and a sense of spirituality, controlling for religiosity, religious affiliation and other sociodemographic controls. Results suggest that fundamentalist beliefs will lead to lower amounts Of empathic concern, perspective-taking, and,fantasy abilities, whereas a sense of spirituality will contribute to higher levels of the same three aspects of empathy Personal distress was found to be unrelated to either fundamentalism or spirituality	1	Christopher Bradley

Rural Sociology	2010	3	P>Justifiably concerned about power dynamics between researchers and participants in participatory research, much of the literature proposes guidelines for including participant voices at every step of the research process. We find these guidelines insufficient for dealing with constraints set up by the social organizational structures in which researchers and participants find themselves. We argue that the process of building relationships between scientists and farmers is unavoidably imperfect, but nonetheless necessary and rewarding. We contend that the potential problems of participatory research originate more from the social organizational structures in which it takes place than in failure to follow particular rules. By acknowledging these structures and the resultant interests of participant and researcher we can make room for the messy reality of negotiating participatory relationships. We suggest that transformative engagement can be born of what we term the ``maculate conceptions'' of dialogic process and the building of mutual trust.	5	Alexandra Lyon; Michael Bell; Nora Swan Croll; Randall Jackson; Claudio Gratton
Friedland, William. 2010. 'New Ways of Working and Organization: Alternative Agrifood Movements and Agrifood Researchers.' Rural Sociology. 75:4 601-627.	Rural Sociology	2010	2	P>The remarkable growth of alternative agrifood movements-organics, fair trade, localism, Slow Food, farmers' markets, community-supported agriculture, food security, food safety, food sovereignty, anti-genetically modified organisms, animal welfare, and others-and their attraction to younger academic scholars offer a unique opportunity to explore ways to strengthen such movements utilizing the structural position and distinctive skills of academic researchers. The various movements constitute the major resource; sympathetic academic researchers are a second resource. Mobilizing these two resources in a new organization, the Alternative Agrifood Researchers without Borders, has the potential to contribute to strengthening the movements and their original progressive orientations and advancing civil society. To be effective, a new organization should parallel existing structures in state and market but focus on progressive goals aimed at reducing inequalities and expanding political and social participation. In building a body of literature usable for comparative analysis, the goal should be more effective alternative agrifood movements providing better services to broader global constituencies while simultaneously improving academic research quality. I draw on three social theories-resource mobilization, strategic intervention, and structural parallelism-to encourage careful revision of established academic paradigms.	1	William H. Friedland

Thus, the author aims at raising some questions about the ethnographic practice of embodied phenomena such as the mystical experiences among the Syrian Sufis.	1	Paulo G. Pinto

Drawing primarily on a discourse analysis of the case, the authors identify a profound disjuncture between the ways in which the law and religious discourse framed the actions of the Trident Three. They explore the ways in which religious claims are reshaped by legal discourse as isolated actions rather than as actions set in a broader moral context with transcendental implications. Their project is to conduct a socio-legal analysis of competing discourses, paying particular attention to the ways in which power relations are worked out. They also acknowledge the contribution of social movements literature to an understanding of the ways in which groups deploy notions of ``the good society'' or ``the public good'' in order to ground their justification of choice of action.	2	Lisa Ann Smith; Lori G.

Dein, Simon. 2010. 'a Messiah From the Dead: Cultural Performance in Lubavitcher Messianism.' Social Compass. 57:4 537-554.	Social Compass	2010	0	The scholarly literature on millennialism commonly employs Festinger's theory of cognitive dissonance to understand how groups deal with failed prophecy. For many years Lubavitcher Hasidim held that their spiritual leader, Menachem Schneerson-the Lubavitcher Rebbe-was the Jewish Messiah and that he would reveal himself as such, ushering in the redemption. He died, however, in 1994 without fulfilling his followers' messianic expectations. The author presents recent ethnographic data from fieldwork among Lubavitcher Hasidim illustrating the role of ritualistic performances and modern communication media (television, radio and the internet) in maintaining a sense of the Rebbe's continuing presence. This ritualised reaffirmation of belief-a collective experience of symbolic fulfilment-provides disappointed followers with social and psychological support to render such an experience less cognitively distressing.	1	Simon Dein
Breen, Richard. 2010. 'Educational Expansion and Social Mobility in the 20(th) Century.' Social Forces. 89:2 365-388.	Social Forces	2010	2	Sociologists consider inequality in educational attainment to be a major cause of inequality between people in their chances of occupying a more advantageous class position. However, there is dispute as to whether educational inequality according to social class background declined during the 20(th) century. What is not in doubt is the expansion of education in the advanced economies during this time, and several authors have pointed to educational expansion as a mechanism by which inequalities in social mobility chances may be reduced. I measure this effect and compare it with the impact of educational equalization on social mobility in Britain, Sweden and Germany during the 20(th) century. I find that in all three countries educational expansion promoted greater social mobility.	1	Richard Breen

Social Forces	2010	1	While income inequality among college graduates is well documented, inequality in occupational status remains largely unexplored. We examine whether and how occupational specificity of college majors is related to college graduates' transition into the labor market and their subsequent occupational trajectories. Analyses of NLSY79 indicate that occupationally specific degrees are beneficial at the point of entry into the labor market but have the lowest growth in occupational status over time. Students earning credentials focusing on general skills, in contrast, begin in jobs with low occupational status but subsequently report the greatest growth. These findings illuminate specific ways in which educational and occupational systems interact and provide a novel approach for understanding inequality in labor market outcomes among college graduates.	2	Josipa Roksa; Tania Levey

Numerous studies have found a positive relationship between education and subsequent civic participation. However, little is known about possible variation in effects by selection into higher education, a critical omission considering education's expressed role as a key mechanism for integrating disadvantaged individuals into civic life. I disaggregate effects and examine whether civic returns to higher education are largest for disadvantaged low likelihood or advantaged high likelihood college goers. I find evidence for significant effect heterogeneity: civic returns to college are greatest among individuals who have a low likelihood for college completion. Returns decrease as the propensity for college increases.	1	Jennie E. Brand

Shadow education in the United States, such as test prep for college entrance exams, has received considerably less attention. Drawing on the National Education Longitudinal Study, we analyze the likelihood of participation in, and the implications of, SAT preparation. Social class inequalities in test preparation, particularly costly SAT courses and private tutoring, are notable and have at least moderate consequences for SAT scores and selective college enrollment. We also find racial/ethnic variations in the use of test preparation. We consider the implications of these findings for understanding shadow education, stratification and educational mobility in the United States.	3	Claudia Buchmann; Dennis J. Condron; Vincent J.

We estimate wage trajectories for four groups: documented Mexican immigrants, undocumented Mexican immigrants, U.S-born Mexican Americans and native non-Latino whites. Our estimates reveal a gross 17 percent wage disparity between documented and undocumented Mexican immigrant men, and a 9 percent documented-undocumented wage disparity for Mexican immigrant women. When worker human capital and occupation are held constant, these wage gaps reduce to 8 and 4 percent, respectively. We also find large differences in returns to human capital with undocumented Mexican immigrants having the lowest wage returns to human capital and having very slow wage growth over time.	3	Matthew Hall; Emily Greenman; George Farkas

Also, physical health and ``balance in life'' (i.e., balance between work/household obligations and leisure) are strongly and negatively associated with depression symptoms.

It uses excerpts from qualitative interview material to highlight the contemporary figures of the ``white worried man'' and the ``white women savior'' and the relationship between them. Through this, it explores how shifts from white pride to white shame reflect shifts in the focus of whiteness away from civilizing the racialized Other to civilizing the white self. Through this analysis, it further complicates shame theory arguing for an understanding of [white] shame as constituted through a relational economy, differentiated through class and gender as well as race.	1	Shona Hunter
Khanna, Nikki & Cathryn Johnson. 2010. 'Passing as Black: Racial Identity Work Among Biracial Americans.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 73:4 380-397.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	7	Drawing on interview data with black-white biracial adults, we examine the considerable agency most have in asserting their racial identities to others. Extending research on ``identity work'' (Snow and Anderson 1987), we explore the strategies biracial people use to conceal (i.e., pass), cover, and/or accent aspects of their racial ancestries, and the individual and structural-level factors that limit the accessibility and/or effectiveness of some strategies. We further find that how these biracial respondents identify is often contextual-most identify as biracial, but in some contexts, they pass as monoracial. Scholars argue that passing may be a relic of the past, yet we find that passing still occurs today. Most notably, we find a striking reverse pattern of passing today-while passing during the Jim Crow era involved passing as white, these respondents more often report passing as black today. Motivations for identity work are explored, with an emphasis on passing as black.	2	Nikki Khanna; Cathryn Johnson
Verkuyten, Maykel, Jochem Thijs & Hidde Bekhuis. 2010. 'Intergroup Contact and Ingroup Reappraisal: Examining the Deprovincialization Thesis.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 73:4 398-416.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	7	According to the deprovincialization thesis, interethnic contact involves a reappraisal and distancing from the ingroup. Contact can broaden one's horizon by acknowledging and recognizing the value of other cultures and thereby putting the taken-for-granted own cultural standards into perspective. The current research uses data from three surveys to examine the relationship between quantity of outgroup contact and ingroup distance (ingroup identification and ingroup feelings) among native Dutch participants. More positive contact with ethnic outgroups was expected to lead to a higher endorsement of multiculturalism, that, in turn, is related to a stronger distancing from the ingroup. Findings in all three studies support the deprovincialization thesis. In addition, in Study 3, mediation is found independently of outgroup threat. Findings across the three studies confirm the stability of the results and cross-validate the deprovincialization thesis.	3	Maykel Verkuyten; Jochem Thijs; Hidde Bekhuis
Sharp, Shane. 2010. 'How Does Prayer Help Manage Emotions?.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 73:4 417-437.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	9	Many individuals use prayer to manage negative emotions, but scholars know little about how prayer accomplishes this task. Using in-depth interview data from victims of intimate partner violence, I argue that prayer is an imaginary social support interaction that provides individuals with resources they use to perform individual emotion management strategies. In particular, interactions with God through prayer provide individuals (1) an other to whom one can express and vent anger; (2) positive reflected appraisals that help maintain self-esteem; (3) reinterpretive cognitions that make situations seem less threatening; (4) an other with whom one can interact to ``zone out'' negative emotion-inducing stimuli; and (5) an emotion management model to imitate. Most of these resources help individuals deal primarily with a particular type of emotion and have an appreciable influence on social action. The analysis presented suggests that scholars should investigate how interactions with imagined others help individuals manage emotions.	1	Shane Sharp

(1) The Hyatt Hotel used a traditional strategy of labor substitution in the context of a new global economy. During this ongoing economic crisis, housekeepers, who were promised good jobs and benefits, had worked hard on a steep climb toward fulfilling the American Dream. The resourcefulness of the unions, who saw the loss of these jobs as a threat to the entire industry, and articulate laid-off workers, who captured the media's attention, kept this newsworthy. (2) When faced with choices over ``whose side are we on,'' our strategies for how to act need to be different than academic posturing. I answer the question of how we should act when we become actors in these situations, which is what the ESS was confronted with over the Hyatt's housekeeper firing.	1	Rosanna Hertz
Pescosolido, Bernice & Sigrun Olafsdottir. 2010. 'the Cultural Turn in Sociology: Can It Help Us Resolve an Age-old Problem in Understanding Decision Making for Health Care?.' Sociological Forum. 25:4 655-676.	Sociological Forum	2010	6	Culture has long shaped individuals' response to problems. A classic puzzle in the sociology of health and illness is discrepancy between theory and research regarding cultural beliefs and medical care service use. ``Utilization research,'' examining individuals' responses to the onset of health problems, has not consistently found an effect of culture on the uptake of formal treatment. While ethnographic research often describes how culture shapes illness behaviors, survey-based studies rarely find significant effects of predispositions once ``need'' is controlled. In quantitative studies, individuals report supportive treatment beliefs or predispositions to use services but low utilization levels, reinforcing claims about lack of utility of cultural ideologies in health-care decision making. We ask whether innovations in the sociology of culture and cognition provide the theoretical scaffolding to conceptualize and measure culture in health service utilization. Examining data from the General Social Survey, we focus on how different approaches to culture might explain the paradox of high cultural predispositions and low actual use. Children with mental health problems provide a comparison between suggestions and endorsements. Suggestions, sources of care offered by individuals in response to a case description without any other social cues, align with new cultural approaches, and are measured by responses to open-ended questions about what should be done for the child described (meeting clinical criteria for ADHD, major depression, asthma, or ``daily troubles''). Endorsements, requiring less cognitive work and cultural resistance, align with traditional conceptualizations of culture, and are measured by closed-ended questions that ask respondents to agree or disagree with seeking help from different treatment options placed later in the survey. We find that suggestions reveal cultural predispositions to use services corresponding closely to reported utilization levels; endorsements reveal high, unrealistic cultural predispositions to use services. Further, suggestions are associated with sociodemographics that proxy culture (e.g., race), while endorsements are associated only with perceived need.	2	Bernice A. Pescosolido; Sigrun Olafsdottir
Miller, Amanda & Sharon Sassler. 2010. 'Stability and Change in the Division of Labor Among Cohabiting Couples.' Sociological Forum. 25:4 677-702.	Sociological Forum	2010	4	Because cohabitors express preferences for egalitarian relationships, it is generally presumed (by researchers and the popular press) that cohabiting couples engage in fairly equitable exchanges of domestic and paid work. This article explores how some cohabiting couples ``do gender'' through the division of labor-both paid and domestic work. Data are from in-depth interviews with both partners from 30 cohabiting couples (N = 60) who have moderate levels of education. Few of these couples began their relationships sharing both paid work and domestic labor equally. Furthermore, the number of couples engaged in equal exchanges declined over time, while those relying on conventional exchanges grew. The devalued nature of domestic work, the persistence of gender privilege, and the ``stalled'' revolution are evident in how these working-class cohabiting couples arrange their divisions of labor, reasons for changes, and why women are less able than men to opt out of housework.	2	Amanda Miller; Sharon Sassler
Warner, Catharine. 2010. 'Emotional Safeguarding: Exploring the Nature of Middle-class Parents' School Involvement.' Sociological Forum. 25:4 703-724.	Sociological Forum	2010	0	Although discussion of parents' school involvement generally surrounds academic success, there are also emotional motivations for parents' school interventions. In this exploratory analysis, based on interviews with 21 parents and teachers, I show how these middle-class parents' concerns for children extend beyond grades and academic success to the children's own emotional comfort with schooling. I discuss examples of emotional safeguarding, a parental practice to protect children's happiness at school. Results also suggest that emotional and academic concerns for children at school are interrelated, and parents often approach the emotional with the academic in mind. Parents focus on reducing children's anxiety or discomfort at school with the ultimate goal of instilling a love of learning. The parents in this study perceive an emotional route to achieving academic success for their middle-class children. Unlike parents, teachers in the study identify parents' concerns as academic or a product of parents' anxiety. This research introduces the possibility that while parents' academic concerns are very real, they are also accompanied by equal and occasionally greater concerns for children's happiness and well-being at school.	1	Catharine H.

Mayer, Brian, Phil Brown & Rachel Morello-Frosch. 2010. 'Labor-environmental Coalition Formation: Framing and the Right to Know.' Sociological Forum. 25:4 746-768.	Sociological Forum	2010	0	This article examines the formation of a cross-movement coalition between elements of the labor and environmental movements in New Jersey. We explain the successful formation and initial political campaign of the New Jersey Work Environment Council with an expansion of the theoretical perspective of frame analysis. We propose a model of a coalition collective action frame that offers several important insights into the active role coalition actors play in the construction of a common frame uniting union and environmental activists. Using qualitative data gathered from interviews, observations, and document analyses of two major campaigns, we argue that the coalition frame allowed new political opportunities to be created, leading to the establishment of the most sweeping right-to-know laws in the United States. We conclude the discussion of coalition framing by examining political constraints on the framing possibilities of coalitions, specifically by exploring how the discursive shift from the right to know to the right to act failed to expand the influence of the cross-movement coalition as originally expected by its members.	3	Brian Mayer; Phil Brown; Rachel Morello-Frosch
Munson, Ziad. 2010. 'Mobilizing on Campus: Conservative Movements and Today's College Students.' Sociological Forum. 25:4 769-786.	Sociological Forum	2010	3	Social movement scholars have known for some time that students, and particularly college students, play an important role in modern social movements. Yet the full extent of conservative mobilizing, both today and in the past, is frequently overlooked. This article highlights the critical role college campuses have played in the rise of conservative movements in the United States over the last 40 years. In doing so, it develops a concept of transition points to help explain the mechanisms responsible for the longstanding finding that college students form an important core of many social movements. Transition points are marked by both changes in routines and changes in social network configuration. The utility of the transition point concept is explored through ethnographic and interview data from the American pro-life movement.	1	Ziad Munson

Sociological Forum	2010	2	Over half of young adults have cohabited, but relatively little is known about the role delinquency and substance use play in youths' odds of cohabiting as well as the implications of cohabitation for early adult offending and substance use. This study focuses on the reciprocal relationship between cohabitation during late adolescence and young adulthood and self-reported offending and substance use. Using longitudinal data, we find that net of traditional predictors, delinquency involvement is associated with increased odds of cohabitation and cohabiting at younger ages while substance use is not related to cohabiting during early adulthood. Further analysis indicates that cohabitation is associated with lower reports of substance use. However, cohabitation is not associated with self-reported offending. The results help unravel the connection between cohabitation experience, offending and substance use, and early adult outcomes.	4	Robert A. Lonardo; Wendy D. Manning; Peggy C. Giordano; Monica A.

Jarvinen, Margaretha & Gale Miller. 2010. 'Methadone Maintenance as Last Resort: a Social Phenomenology of a Drug Policy.' Sociological Forum. 25:4 804-823.	Sociological Forum	2010	1	Drawing on qualitative interviews with drug addicts in Copenhagen, Denmark, this article offers a phenomenological reading of a methadone maintenance program. The program is set within the principles of harm reduction, meaning that its aim is not to cure the participants' addiction but to keep them stable on substitution medicine and slow the deterioration of their lives. We analyze the program's implications for participants' sense of agency and constraint and for their orientations toward the past, present, and future. A major concern is with the program as a last resort policy that challenges neoliberal ideals of self-governance and self-development. While the program increases the participants' sense of stability by providing them with methadone and by allowing them to better address their economic, housing, and other needs of everyday life, it also represents a context of physical, emotional, and social dependence. The interviews cast the program as a paradox that simultaneously increases participants' sense of stability and vulnerability. In essence, the Danish methadone program has the effect of both helping the participants by reducing the drug-related harm in their lives and of fostering conditions of inferiorization and enduring nonbecoming.	2	Margaretha Jarvinen; Gale Miller
Ostertag, Stephen. 2010. 'Processing Culture: Cognition, Ontology, and the News Media.' Sociological Forum. 25:4 824-850.	Sociological Forum	2010	1	This article discusses how people cognitively engage with the contemporary, mainstream, U.S. news in ways that yield ontological services. It treats the news as both a system of signs and a cultural object, and assesses how people mentally intercept, negotiate, and use the news in ways that foster a sense of control and order over an unstable and unpredictable social world (i.e., ``ontological security'') (Giddens, 1991). Based on interview data, it argues that through criticisms, consumption orientations, lay theorizing, and ``ignorant othering,'' all orbiting and drawing from the contemporary, mainstream, U.S. news, people cognitively sift through and simplify a broader frenzied social environment. In so doing, they are able to mentally establish at minimum a sense of rudimentary understanding and at most a sense of trusted certainty of what is real and true of the world outside their immediate social circles.	1	Stephen F.

Sociological Perspectives	2010	2	Toxic or harmful working conditions are an important problem for workers and organizations. Fully understanding the consequences of such conditions has been difficult because in-depth information across organizational contexts is scarce. The current article makes use of a new data set based on content coding the full population of organizational ethnographies (N = 212) to secure in-depth evaluations across a wide range of organizational contexts. The analysis confirms the role of lack of autonomy and lack of skills as toxic working conditions but suggests an equally important role for organizational chaos. Importantly, returning to the narrative accounts allows exploration of the buffering and exacerbating roles of coworker relations and employee involvement and the mechanisms through which these work to moderate other conditions.	2	Lindsey Joyce Chamberlain; Randy Hodson
Keene, Jennifer & Anastasia Prokos. 2010. 'Gendered Disparities in Take-ups of Employee Health Benefits.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:4 503-526.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	1	Using a sample of 2,271 workers from the 2002 National Study of the Changing Workforce whose employers offered personal health insurance, this article investigates the gendered nature of health insurance benefit take-ups. These analyses include family and employment characteristics in addition to employers' contributions to health insurance premiums, a measure that is unexamined in sociological analyses of health benefits. Progressive logistic regression models predict the effects of gender and family characteristics. Results indicate that women with employed spouses are less likely to take up their own health benefits than are comparable men, net of basic employment characteristics. Gender differences disappear, however, when controlling for the level of employer contributions: women and men are equally likely to draw on their own employer's health benefits once we account for their out-of-pocket expense. The authors conclude that family contexts and employment structures jointly influence individuals' choices about their health benefits. The gendered structure of employment and, specifically, gendered patterns in employer contributions to health benefits are a better explanation for women's lower chances of benefit take-ups than gender relations within families.	2	Jennifer Reid Keene; Anastasia H.

Oselin, Sharon. 2010. 'Weighing the Consequences of a Deviant Career: Factors Leading to an Exit From Prostitution.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:4 527-549.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	3	Research on how individuals leave sex work examines this transition by focusing on either structural/economic conditions that keep them in the trade or internal changes that prompt exiting. Leaving certain roles, such as those deemed criminal and deviant, may be more challenging due to labeling, stigma, and a lack of resources. In this study, the author analyzes the particular factors that lead women to exit street prostitution via enrollment in ``helping'' organizations. The author finds extant theories do not fully capture how multiple factors combine to pull women off the streets. Rather, the author contends it is both internal and external factors that lead women to initially exit prostitution. This study draws on interviews with thirty-six street prostitutes from four different U. S. cities to address these concerns.	1	Sharon S. Oselin
Pyke, Karen. 2010. 'What Is Internalized Racial Oppression and Why Don't We Study It? Acknowledging Racism's Hidden Injuries.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:4 551-572.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	2	Despite sociology's longstanding interest in inequality, the internalization of racial oppression among the racially subordinated and its contribution to the reproduction of racial inequality has been largely ignored, reflecting a taboo on the subject. Consequently, internalized racism remains one of the most neglected and misunderstood components of racism. In this article, the author argues that only by defying the taboo can sociology expose the hidden injuries of racism and the subtle mechanisms that sustain White privilege. After reviewing the concept and providing examples of the phenomenon, the author draws on critical social theory to examine reasons for the taboo, such as a theoretical fixation on resistance, a penchant for racial essentialism, and the limitations of an identity politics. The author concludes by offering a method for studying internalized racism and resistance concurrently within the matrix of intersecting forms of oppression.	1	Karen D. Pyke

Sociological Perspectives. 53:4 573-592.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	0	This study examines the earnings of African immigrants across three waves of U. S. Census data (1980, 1990, and 2000). The authors find that the U. S. labor market favors White male immigrants, followed by Black male and White female immigrants, and finally Black women. The authors also find that male immigrants earned more per hour than female immigrants regardless of race. Considering change over time, this study finds that the earnings gap between Black and White male immigrants is growing larger over time, the positive association between foreign work experience and earnings is attenuated over time, and for women, the positive effect of earning a college degree on earnings is growing stronger over time. These findings confirm many of the conclusions reached by other race and gender scholars; however, the authors extend this work by focusing on male and female African immigrants, who are largely under-represented in the literature, and by examining change over time.	2	Casey Borch; Mamadi K.

The authors explore the effects of socioeconomic differences (education, occupational status, and income) on four dimensions of individual global exposure. The results obtained from the regression analysis suggest that social class is a critical determinant in explaining individual global exposure.	2	Ming-Chang Tsai; Richard P. Appelbaum

We develop a theory of resource substitution which implies that education improves health more for women than men. Data from a 1995 survey of U.S. adults with follow-ups in 1998 and 2001 support the hypothesis. Physical impairment decreases more for women than for men as the level of education increases. The gender gap in impairment essentially disappears among people with a college degree. Latent growth SEM vectors also show that among the college educated, men's and women's life course patterns of physical impairment do not differ significantly.	2	Catherine E. Ross; John Mirowsky

The demand-side factor, percentage of women in an occupation, helps explain authority differences between men and women in most groups. Supply-side factors, and, in white-black comparisons, occupational location, contribute to differences by race and ethnicity within genders. In the later period, education is particularly important for Hispanic men reflecting, we believe, the recent surge in immigration rates.	2	Beth Mintz; Daniel H. Krymkowski

Clark, Rob. 2010. 'Technical and Institutional States: Loose Coupling in the Human Rights Sector of the World Polity.' Sociological Quarterly. 51:1 65-95.	Sociological Quarterly	2010	10	While human rights treaties have become increasingly popular over the past quarter century, there has not been a corresponding improvement in human rights practices. This discrepancy implies that a country's formal pledge to uphold human rights principles is ``loosely coupled'' from its actual performance. In this study, I develop a model of loose coupling based on organizational research and apply it to the human rights sector of the world polity. Empirically, I identify a set of institutional states whose human rights practices fall short of their treaty commitments, as well as a set of technical states whose practices exceed their commitments. Analyzing an unbalanced data set with a maximum of 755 observations across 167 countries during the 1975 to 2000 period, I use random effects models to predict a state's location on the Human Rights Decoupling Index (HRDI). The findings illustrate the importance of several organizational concepts for predicting a state's HRDI score. In particular, the analyses reveal the countervailing effects of globalization. While economic globalization (i.e., trade and foreign investment) is associated with the technical (positive) end of the HRDI, cultural globalization (i.e., memberships in international organizations) is associated with the institutional (negative) end.	1	Rob Clark

Taking a multidimensional approach to identity and drawing on reflected appraisals (how they think others see them), I examine racial identity among black-white adults in the South and the lingering influence of the one-drop rule. Most respondents internally identify as black and when asked to explain these black identities, they describe how both blacks and whites see them as black. I argue that the one-drop rule still shapes racial identity, namely through the process of reflected appraisals.	1	Nikki Khanna

We address this by exploring how students perceive their creative contributions to college life. By analyzing narratives, we find that the majority of creativity is associated with everyday experiences and social interactions, in contrast to a popular and scholarly focus on extraordinary individual achievement in domains like art and science. We also find strong trends in sociability as students negotiate both ``where they stand'' with regards to those around them as well as ``how they stand out'' as individuals.	3	Mark A.

Sociological Quarterly	2010	5	Despite extensive research on multiracial youth in recent years, to date, no empirical studies have analyzed how racial context may affect biracial adolescents' sense of belonging in a social institution beyond families. In this study, we examine how the racial makeup of the student body affects self-identified biracial adolescents' school attachment. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find that the proportions of white or black students in school significantly affect the school attachment of Hispanic/black, Asian/black, and American Indian/black biracial adolescents, but school racial composition in general has little influence on biracial adolescents with a partial-white identification (i.e., black/white, Hispanic/white, Asian/white, and American Indian/white). Our analyses also show that on average, students of most biracial groups display lower school attachment than their corresponding monoracial groups, but the differences from the monoracial groups with the lower school attachment are generally small. We discuss the implications of our findings for biracial adolescents' perceived racial boundaries and contemporary American race relations.	2	Simon Cheng; Joshua Klugman
Fine, Gary. 2010. 'the Sociology of the Local: Action and Its Publics.' Sociological Theory. 28:4 355-376.	Sociological Theory	2010	8	Sociology requires a robust theory of how local circumstances create social order. When we analyze social structures not recognizing that they depend on groups with collective pasts and futures that are spatially situated and that are based on personal relations, we avoid a core sociological dimension: the importance of local context in constituting social worlds. Too often this has been the sociological stance, both in micro-sociological studies that examine interaction as untethered from local traditions and in research that treats culture as autonomous from action and choice. Building on theories of action, group dynamics, and micro-cultures, I argue that a sociology of the local solves critical theoretical problems. The local is a stage on which social order gets produced and a lens for understanding how particular forms of action are selected. Treating ethnographic studies as readings of ongoing cultures, I examine how the continuing and referential features of group life (spatial arenas, relations, shared pasts) generate action and argue that local practices provide the basis for cultural extension, influencing societal expectations through the linkages among groups.	1	Gary Alan Fine

Sociological Theory	2010	0	Based on qualitative analysis of the Soviet press and official state documents, this article argues that the Communist Party was, counterintuitively, an agent of capitalist dispositions in the Soviet Union during 1970s-1980s. Understanding the spirit of capitalism not simply as an ascetic ethos but in broader terms of the cult of individualism, I demonstrate that the Soviet party-state promoted ideas and values of individuality, self-expression, and pleasure seeking in the areas of work and consumption. By broadening our conception of the spirit of capitalism, tracing the formation of capitalist dispositions as well as institutions, and showing that the culture of capitalism can come from within the old regime, I further the agenda of neoclassical sociology of studying varieties of origins, paths, and destinations of modern capitalisms.	1	Anna Paretskaya

I develop this claim through a case study of seventeenth-century France, where the power of impersonal rule, exercised through logistics, was fundamental to state formation. Logistical activity circumvented patrimonial networks, disempowering the nobility and supporting a new regime of impersonal rule: the modern, territorial state.	1	Chandra Mukerji

Sociology of Religion	2010	4	It has long been assumed that higher education has a corrosive effect on religious belief and practice. Contrary to research from the 1970s and 80s, however, recent studies show that the college experience has little effect on the religiosity of college students. In this paper, I reconcile these opposing viewpoints by showing that higher education has a liberalizing effect, but only for a minority of students. A sample of church-going Protestants demonstrates that those with higher education are more theologically liberal, but the type of education matters more than the amount of higher education. Exposure to secular theories and whether one attends secular or religious schools have robust effects on theological liberalism.	1	Sam Reimer
Manglos, Nicolette. 2010. 'Born Again in Balaka: Pentecostal Versus Catholic Narratives of Religious Transformation in Rural Malawi.' Sociology of Religion. 71:4 409-431.	Sociology of Religion	2010	5	Pentecostal membership and born-again conversion have been growing in popularity across Africa. Yet despite the many explanations posited for their growth, few studies have attended to the local meanings attached to the born-again identity specifically. In this study, I compare narratives of born-again conversion among a sample of Pentecostal and Catholic young people in Malawi, in order to better understand its meaning and appeal as a religious identity. I argue that the born-again identity is highly salient for those who claim it; and that although its roots are in Pentecostalism, it has diffused widely into other denominations. I also argue that for these young people, it is described not primarily as a conversion of belief but as a conversion to a new moral lifestyle; and that the major difference between Pentecostals and Catholics is in their expressed sense of the attainability of this conversion, not of its desirability. The connection between the born-again lifestyle and the impact of modernity in the development context is also explored.	1	Nicolette D. Manglos
Kraus, Rachel. 2010. 'They Danced in the Bible: Identity Integration Among Christian Women Who Belly Dance.' Sociology of Religion. 71:4 457-482.	Sociology of Religion	2010	2	Christianity has expectations regarding appropriate gender roles, the body, and sexuality. Belly dance helps women creatively express themselves, move their bodies in new ways, become empowered, and feel sensual. Many Christian belly dancers also consider the dance to be spiritual. Yet, most of these women do not personally experience conflict between belly dance and Christianity. Utilizing interviews with 27 Catholic and Protestant female belly dancers, this project examines how Christian belly dancers integrate their identities derived from both worlds without experiencing conflict. Results show that along with maintaining dual roles, selectively defining religion, and separating roles, belly dancers use a new strategy that I call ``setting intention'' to integrate their Christianity and belly dancing. These findings illustrate how identity integration techniques are used without a history of conflict, and how people combine their identities derived from religious institutions with spiritually meaningful leisure activities that challenge some of their religion's tenets.	1	Rachel Kraus

This case extends our understanding of how social movements make strategic use of political openings and also illustrates the circumstances under which an ethnic difference framing can be a more effective political strategy for achieving rights for black populations than a racial equality framing.	1	Tianna S.

American Journal of Sociology	2010	4	The authors use employment histories from survey data to examine personal network use and stratification in the Russian labor market from 1985 to 2001. Institutional changes associated with the Soviet collapse increased the use of networks and shaped their prevalence and benefits in theoretically coherent ways. In Russia, networks positively affect job quality, whether measured by occupation, current earnings, or wage arrears. These findings relate to recent debates over whether job contacts provide advantages and how social capital relates to postsocialist inequalities involving gender, Communist Party membership, and education. Russia also exhibits a previously overlooked relationship between network use and locality type.	2	Theodore P. Gerber; Olga Mayorova

It finds no racial difference in the reemployment wage, but there is a large racial disparity in the chances of reemployment among workers with equivalent characteristics and experience. This lower reemployment rate of displaced black workers may be due to individual differences in search behavior, but it is also consistent with contemporary accounts of hiring discrimination.	1	Thomas S.

Our aim is to advance the scientific understanding of early sexual experiences by explicitly considering contraceptive use and by differentiating between the consequences of parental family experiences during Childhood and those during adolescence and young adulthood. Thanks to unique, highly detailed data measuring parental family experiences throughout the life course and sexual dynamics early in life it is possible to provide detailed empirical estimates of the relationship between parental family experiences and contraceptive use at first sex a relationship about which we know relatively little. Findings reveal (1) significant simultaneous consequences of many different dimensions of parental family experiences for the timing of first sex and the likelihood of using contraception at first sex, but the specific dimensions of family important for the specific behavior vary across racial groups: and (2) that parental family experiences influence the timing of sex and contraceptive use differently.	2	Sarah R.

Fomby, Paula & Cynthia Osborne. 2010. 'the Influence of Union Instability and Union Quality on Children's Aggressive Behavior.' Social Science Research. 39:6 912-924.	Social Science Research	2010	4	We investigate whether mother's poor union quality attenuates the association between union instability and young children's behavioral adjustment. Using data from three waves of the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Study to consider children born to married or cohabiting mothers (N = 1730), we determine that children who have experienced poor union quality between mothers and their partners have higher predicted aggressive behavior scores at age 3, regardless of whether they have experienced union transitions, compared to children who have experienced high-quality, stable unions. Children who have experienced instability in the context of higher-quality unions and relatively less acrimonious dissolutions are similar to children raised in high-quality stable unions in terms of predicted aggressive behavior scores.	2	Paula Fomby; Cynthia Osborne
Adkins, Kate & Claire Dush. 2010. 'the Mental Health of Mothers in and After Violent and Controlling Unions.' Social Science Research. 39:6 925-937.	Social Science Research	2010	2	Studies have shown that intimate partner violence (IPV) is associated with poor mental health. But, does women's, and specifically mother's, mental health improve after leaving a union marked by IPV? We used two waves of the Fragile Families and Child Well-Being Study (n = 2610) to examine the association between IPV as measured by controlling and violent behaviors, and maternal mental health and union dissolution. Mothers in unions marked by IPV reported poorer mental health, became more depressed and maintained high levels of anxiety over time regardless of whether or not their union dissolved, compared to mothers who were in non-abusive unions. Mothers in stable non-abusive unions became more depressed over time, but at a lower magnitude than mothers in controlling and violent unions. Mothers in non-abusive unions that dissolved also became more depressed and anxious over time. Overall, we find that women are still at risk for mental health problems even after leaving IPV unions.	2	Kate S. Adkins; Claire M. Dush

Social Science Research	2010	2	The rise in singlehood among young adults is often seen as an indication that young adults are nowadays more individualized, suggesting that singlehood is viewed as a positive experience. Using the Panel Study of Social Integration in the Netherlands, we examined singles' (N = 836) relational attitudes across young adulthood. Singles were not very positive about singlehood and a large majority felt more positive about a partner relationship than about being alone. Most singles were also more positive about living together than about steady dating and cohabitation was more popular than marriage. We furthermore examined whether values, life-course experiences and ageing influence singles' relational attitudes. Value orientations and age proved to be the most consistent predictors. Singles with liberal values and older singles had less positive attitudes toward relational commitment than less liberal and younger singles. The findings suggest that the positive image of singlehood needs to be reconsidered.	2	Anne-Rigt Poortman; Aart C. Liefbroer
Kawamura, Sayaka & Susan Brown. 2010. 'Mattering and Wives' Perceived Fairness of the Division of Household Labor.' Social Science Research. 39:6 976-986.	Social Science Research	2010	0	Using data on married women from the sixth survey wave of the Marital Instability over the Life Course (2000, N = 489), we examine the influence of mattering, or the extent to which wives believe they are important to their husbands, on wives' perceptions of fairness of the division of household labor. Mattering taps into wives' beliefs about their husbands' supportiveness of them, as evidenced by respect, concern, and appreciation. We find that the more wives believe they matter to their husbands, the more likely they are to report the division of housework is fair, regardless of the share of housework wives perform, time availability, relative resources, and gender role attitudes. This research contributes to prior work on wives' perceived fairness of the division of household labor by demonstrating the salience of broader emotional dynamics in the marriage.	2	Sayaka Kawamura; Susan L.

How Opportunity, Incentives and Confidence Affect Donations to Different Types of Charitable Organizations.' Social Science Research. 39:6 1073-1087.	Social Science Research	2010	4	This study is the first to investigate charitable giving to as many as 64 different organizations, predicting what type of charitable organization receives donations from which particular people. We test hypotheses with conditional logistic regression analysis, using the Giving in the Netherlands Panel Study (N(households) = 1246; N(organizations) = 64). We found that providing people with the opportunity to give increases donations, while which people will donate is conditional on the type of request made. Furthermore, we found some support for the argument that organizations receive more donations from people that have specific incentives (social status motives, religious and political values) to donate to these organizations. Finally, only organizations striving for difficult goals receive more donations from people with higher levels of confidence.	1	Pamala Wiepking
Yu, Wei-hsin. 2010. 'Enduring an Economic Crisis: the Effect of Macroeconomic Shocks on Intragenerational Mobility in Japan.' Social Science Research. 39:6 1088-1107.	Social Science Research	2010	3	After the burst of its ``bubble'' economy in 1989, Japan experienced an astonishingly long economic recession whose gravity surpassed any seen in the industrialized world since the 1930s. While this recession is likely to have important consequences on the well-known workplace arrangements and career mobility patterns in that country, systematic analyses of such consequences are nearly absent. This study examines changes in the rates and directions of job mobility in Japan using work history data collected in 2005 from a nationally representative sample of men and women. I find evidence that Japanese firms have largely retained the core elements of the permanent employment system. The norm that stresses men's loyalty to their employers, however, appears to have weakened, resulting in higher voluntary job turnover among male workers. In addition, the gender gap in lifetime mobility processes has narrowed, but not because Japanese women have gained opportunities in the workplace. Rather, economic stagnation has led to greater fluctuations in employment and wages over men's life course, thereby closing the gender gap. Beyond illustrating the changing stratification process in Japan, the findings have general implications for understanding how economic crises impact employment relations, institutional transformations, and social change in advanced industrialized countries.	1	Wei-hsin Yu

Social Science Research	2010	2	This study investigates racial differences in the short-term and long-term effect of living in public housing as a child on socioeconomic attainment among young adults from low-income families. Using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 data and state-level public housing information, propensity score matching estimations addressed the self-selection problems encountered when evaluating the impact of welfare programs. The study findings indicate that Blacks with short-term public housing residence during adolescence seem to be more disadvantaged in terms of housing self-sufficiency and car ownership in an early adulthood than their low-income Black counterparts who lived in private housing. In the long run; however, public housing residence had very small effects on socioeconomic attainment of both White and Black young adults. The benefits of public housing in terms of providing a secure residence for economically vulnerable groups; therefore, outweigh any potential negative impacts.	1	Yumiko Aratani

Social Science Research	2010	1	Researchers have explored the considerable negative effect of an individual's or his spouse's poor health on their wealth accumulation. Health selection may also operate across generations, affecting the wealth of children whose parents suffer from poor health. We develop an intergenerational model of health selection in wealth using life course theory to understand whether parents' non-fatal serious health events affect inter vivos financial transfers to children. First, we estimate the relationship between parents' serious health events in adulthood and wealth accumulation, showing that data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study reproduce results from research using U.S. national panel studies and supporting the generalizability of our intergenerational health selection results. Second, we find strong evidence of intergenerational health selection. Individuals with less initial wealth and who experience a serious health event are about 34\% more likely to transfer money to their children and transfer 60\% more money to their children when they do.	2	Megan Andrew; Erin Ruel

Social Science Research	2010	0	This article investigates structural sources of earnings losses in the U.S. labor market, analyzing data from the Outgoing Rotation Groups and Displaced Worker Supplements of the 2003 2008 Current Populations Survey. After introducing the data and methodology, a descriptive model of inter-industry earnings differentials in the full labor market between 2003 and 2008 is presented to motivate a baseline claim that industry of employment represents a salient partition of the distribution of good and bad jobs over this time period. Then, the current wages of two groups of workers in 2006 and 2008, who were displaced from their jobs in the prior 3 years, are modeled. Earnings losses of re-employed workers are analyzed, conditional on re-employment in alternative industries, while simultaneously adjusting for observed determinants of selection into employment. The findings demonstrate that displaced workers who are then re-employed suffer from earnings losses in their new jobs. These losses are larger among those who switch industries, especially among those who move to traditional low-wage industries in the service sector. The losses are also larger for those who held their prior jobs for 3 or more years, and they cannot be explained away by differences in the skill requirements between the jobs from which individuals are displaced and those in which they are re-employed. The findings are discussed with reference to structural theories of labor market inequality from sociology and economics, which represent valuable complementary perspectives to individualistic skill-based accounts of earnings differences.	2	Youngjoo Cha; Stephen L.

Social Science Research	2010	5	An operational definition of Guanxi behavior (a type of Chinese social networking) was developed, and several personality and social psychological variables were tested for their relationship with the Guanxi behaviors (in relation to family, friends, and doing favors) developed from the definition. Correlations computed from self reports of 382 Chinese citizens affirmed the expected relationships, and regressions revealed Family Emotional Support, Gregariousness, Chinese Values, and Face to be positively and significantly related to, and explained 41-55\% of the variance for, the Guanxi social-networking behaviors. In addition, the Guanxi behaviors explained significant variance for Coworker Support, Life Satisfaction, and Attribution-to-Self for success in life. Concepts are discussed in relation to Chinese culture, as well as attachment and needs theories.	2	Robert J. Taormina; Jennifer H. Gao
Peng, Yusheng. 2010. 'When Formal Laws and Informal Norms Collide: Lineage Networks Versus Birth Control Policy in China.' American Journal of Sociology. 116:3 770-805.	American Journal of Sociology	2010	1	Ancestor worship and bloodline continuation are the core norms of lineage in China. Beginning in the late 1970s, these cultural norms came into direct confrontation with the state birth control policy. Pitched against each other are the antinatalist laws backed by the powerful and unyielding state apparatus on the one side and the ancient pronatalist norms backed by revived lineage networks on the other. Even though the draconian state policies did succeed in dramatically reducing the overall birthrates, data analyses show that villages with strong kinship networks tend to have higher birthrates. The findings demonstrate the normative capacity of social networks to bend the iron bars of formal institutions. A general framework is developed for analyzing the roles of social networks in four ideal-typical juxtapositions of formal and informal institutions: normativism, legalism, congruence, and conflict.	1	Yusheng Peng

American Journal of Sociology	2010	1	Class differences in educational decision making are important for inequality. A unique Swedish population-level database of university applications and individuals' ranking of different programs is used to analyze class differences in preferences for different program characteristics. Compared to individuals from service class backgrounds, individuals from manual labor class backgrounds choose programs of shorter duration with lower grade point requirements located closer to their parents' home. Children from the service class instead prefer programs with higher earnings risk and avoid nontraditional institutions. Taken together, the differences in degree choice lead to substantial differences in expected earnings levels and expected unemployment risks.	1	Martin Haellsten

American Journal of Sociology	2010	7	This article introduces a network model that pictures occupants of robust positions as recipients of diversified support from durably located others and portrays occupants of fragile positions as dependents on tenuously situated others. The model extends Herfindahl's index of concentration by bringing in the recursiveness of Bonacich's method. Using Newcomb's study of a college fraternity, we find empirical support for the contention that fragility reduces future growth in status. Applications of the model to input-output networks among industries in the U.S. economy and to hiring networks among academic departments are also presented. Implications for future research are discussed.	3	Matthew S. Bothner; Edward Bishop Smith; Harrison C. White
Groen, Jeffrey & Anne Polivka. 2010. 'Going Home After Hurricane Katrina: Determinants of Return Migration and Changes in Affected Areas.' Demography. 47:4 821-844.	Demography	2010	5	This article examines the decision of Hurricane Katrina evacuees to return to their pre-Katrina areas and documents how the composition of the Katrina-affected region changed over time. Using data from the Current Population Survey, we show that an evacuee's age, family income, and the severity of damage in an evacuee's county of origin are important determinants of whether an evacuee returned during the first year after the storm. Blacks were less likely to return than whites, but this difference is primarily related to the geographical pattern of storm damage rather than to race per se. The difference between the composition of evacuees who returned and the composition of evacuees who did not return is the primary force behind changes in the composition of the affected areas in the first two years after the storm. Katrina is associated with substantial shifts in the racial composition of the affected areas (namely, a decrease in the percentage of residents who are black) and an increasing presence of Hispanics. Katrina is also associated with an increase in the percentage of older residents, a decrease in the percentage of residents with low income/education, and an increase in the percentage of residents with high income/education.	2	Jeffrey A.

Flippen, Chenoa. 2010. 'the Spatial Dynamics of Stratification: Metropolitan Context, Population Redistribution, and Black and Hispanic Homeownership.' Demography. 47:4 845-868.	Demography	2010	3	Racial and ethnic inequality in homeownership remains stubbornly wide, even net of differences across groups in household-level sociodemographic characteristics. This article investigates the role of contextual forces in structuring disparate access to homeownership among minorities. Specifically, I combine household- and metropolitan-level census data to assess the impact of metropolitan housing stock, minority composition, and residential segregation on black and Hispanic housing tenure. The measure of minority composition combines both the size and rate of growth of the coethnic population to assess the impact on homeownership inequality of recent trends in population redistribution, particularly the increase in black migration to the South and dramatic dispersal of Hispanics outside traditional areas of settlement. Results indicate remarkable similarity between blacks and Hispanics with respect to the spatial and contextual influences on homeownership. For both groups, homeownership is higher and inequality with whites is smaller in metropolitan areas with an established coethnic base and in areas in which their group is less residentially segregated. Implications of recent trends in population redistribution for the future of minority homeownership are discussed.	1	Chenoa A. Flippen
Iceland, John & Kyle Nelson. 2010. 'the Residential Segregation of Mixed-nativity Married Couples.' Demography. 47:4 869-893.	Demography	2010	2	This article examines the ways in which mixed-nativity marriage is related to spatial assimilation in metropolitan areas of the United States. Specifically, we examine the residential patterns of households with a mixed-nativity and, in some cases, interracial marriage to determine whether they are less segregated from the native-born than entirely foreign-born households. Using restricted-use data from the 2000 census, we find that compared with couples in which both spouses are foreign-born, mixed-nativity couples tend to be less segregated from various native-born racial and ethnic groups. Further, among both foreign-born Asians and Hispanics, those with a native-born non-Hispanic white spouse are considerably less segregated from native-born white households than from other foreign-born Asian and Hispanic households. We also find that even though nativity status matters for black couples in a manner consistent with assimilation theory foreign-born and mixed-nativity black households still each display very high levels of segregation from all other native-born racial/ethnic groups, reaffirming the power of race in determining residential patterns. Overall, our findings provide moderate support for spatial assimilation theory and suggest that cross-nativity marriages often facilitate the residential integration of the foreign-born.	2	John Iceland; Kyle Anne Nelson
Light, Audrey & Taehyun Ahn. 2010. 'Divorce as Risky Behavior.' Demography. 47:4 895-921.	Demography	2010	3	Given that divorce often represents a high-stakes income gamble, we ask how individual levels of risk tolerance affect the decision to divorce. We extend the orthodox divorce model by assuming that individuals are risk averse, that marriage is risky, and that divorce is even riskier. The model predicts that conditional on the expected gains to marriage and divorce, the probability of divorce increases with relative risk tolerance because risk averse individuals require compensation for the additional risk that is inherent in divorce. To implement the model empirically, we use data for first-married women and men from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to estimate a probit model of divorce in which a measure of risk tolerance is among the covariates. The estimates reveal that a 1-point increase in risk tolerance raises the predicted probability of divorce by 4.3\% for a representative man and by 11.4\% for a representative woman. These findings are consistent with the notion that divorce entails a greater income gamble for women than for men.	2	Audrey Light; Taehyun Ahn
Lyngstad, Torkild & Alexia Prskawetz. 2010. 'Do Siblings' Fertility Decisions Influence Each Other?.' Demography. 47:4 923-934.	Demography	2010	9	Individuals' fertility decisions are shaped not only by their own characteristics and life course paths but also by social interaction with others. However, in practice, it is difficult to disentangle the role of social interaction from other factors, such as individual and family background variables. We measure social interaction through the cross-sibling influences on fertility. Continuous-time hazard models are estimated separately for women's first and second births. In addition to individual socioeconomic variables, demographic variables, and an unobserved factor specific to each sibling pair, siblings' birth events and their timing enter as time-varying covariates. We use data from longitudinal population-wide Norwegian administrative registers. The data cover more than 110,000 sibling pairs and include the siblings' fertility, education, income, and marital histories. Our results indicate that cross-sibling influences are relatively strong for the respondents' first births but weak for the second parity transition.	2	Torkild Hovde Lyngstad; Alexia Prskawetz
Stecklov, Guy, Calogero Carletto, Carlo Azzarri & Benjamin Davis. 2010. 'Gender and Migration From Albania.' Demography. 47:4 935-961.	Demography	2010	3	This article examines the dynamics and causes of the shift in the gender composition of migration, and more particularly, in women's access to migration opportunities and decision-making. Our analysis focuses on Albania, a natural laboratory for studying international migration where out-migration was essentially nonexistent from the end of World War II to the end of the 1980s. Interest in the Albanian case is heightened because of the complex layers of inequality existing at the time when migration began: relatively low levels of inequality within the labor market and educational system a product of the Communist era while household relations remained heavily steeped in tradition and patriarchy. We use micro-level data from the Albania 2005 Living Standards Measurement Study, including migration histories for family members since migration began. Based on discrete-time hazard models, the analysis shows a dramatic increase in male migration and a gradual and uneven expansion of the female proportion of this international migration. Female migration, which is shown to be strongly associated with education, wealth, and social capital, appears responsive to economic incentives and constraints. Using information on the dependency of female migration to the household demographic structure as well as the sensitivity of female migration to household-level shocks, we show how household-level constraints and incentives affect male and female migration differently Throughout this period, however, women's migration behavior appears more directly aligned with household-level factors, and there is little evidence to suggest that increased female migration signals rising behavioral independence among Albanian women.	4	Guy Stecklov; Calogero Carletto; Carlo Azzarri; Benjamin Davis
Chen, Feinian & Kim Korinek. 2010. 'Family Life Course Transitions and Rural Household Economy During China's Market Reform.' Demography. 47:4 963-987.	Demography	2010	0	This article investigates the effect of family life course transitions on labor allocation strategies in rural Chinese households. We highlight three types of economic activity that involve reallocation of household labor oriented toward a more diversified, nonfarm rural economy: involvement in wage employment, household entrepreneurship, and/or multiple activities that span economic sectors. With the use of data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS 1997, 2000, and 2004), our longitudinal analyses of rural household economic activity point to the significance of household demography, life course transitions, and local economic structures as factors facilitating household labor reallocation. First, as expected, a relatively youthful household structure is conducive to innovative economic behavior Second, household entrances and exits are significant, but their impacts are not equal. Life events such as births, deaths, marriage, or leaving home for school or employment affect household economy in distinctive ways. Finally, the reallocations of household labor undertaken by households are shaped by local economic structures: in particular the extent of village-level entrepreneurial activity, off-farm employment, and out-migration.	2	Feinian Chen; Kim Korinek
Chakraborty, Tanika & Sukkoo Kim. 2010. 'Kinship Institutions and Sex Ratios in India.' Demography. 47:4 989-1012.	Demography	2010	4	This article explores the relationship between kinship institutions and sex ratios in India at the turn of the twentieth century. Because kinship rules vary by caste, language, religion, and region, we construct sex ratios by these categories at the district level by using data from the 1901 Census of India for Punjab (North), Bengal (East), and Madras (South). We find that the male-to-female sex ratio varied positively with caste rank, fell as one moved from the North to the East and then to the South, was higher for Hindus than for Muslims, and was higher for northern Indo-Aryan speakers than for the southern Dravidian-speaking people. We argue that these systematic patterns in the data are consistent with variations in the institution of family, kinship, and inheritance.	2	Tanika Chakraborty; Sukkoo Kim

Demography	2010	5	This article examines pathways to adulthood among Dutch cohorts born in the second half of the nineteenth century. Although largely overlooked by previous studies, theory suggests that life courses of young adults born during this period were already influenced by a process of standardization, in the sense that their life courses became more similar over time. Using data from a Dutch registry-based sample, we examine household trajectories: that is, sequences of living arrangements of young adults aged 15-40. Our study shows that for successive cohorts, household trajectories became more similar We identified six types of trajectories: early death, life-cycle service, early family formation, late family formation, singlehood, and childless but with partner Over time, early family formation gradually became the ``standard'' trajectory to adulthood. However, late family formation and singlehood, common pathways within the preindustrial western European marriage pattern, remained widespread among cohorts born in the late nineteenth century. Laboring class youths, farmers' daughters, young people of mixed religious background, and urban-born youngsters were the nineteenth century forerunners of a standard pathway to adulthood.	3	Hilde Bras; Aart C.

Kirby, James & Toshiko Kaneda. 2010. 'Unhealthy and Uninsured: Exploring Racial Differences in Health and Health Insurance Coverage Using a Life Table Approach.' Demography. 47:4 1035-1051.	Demography	2010	6	Millions of people in the United States do not have health insurance, and wide racial and ethnic disparities exist in coverage. Current research provides a limited description of this problem, focusing on the number or proportion of individuals without insurance at a single time point or for a short period. Moreover: the literature provides no sense of the joint risk of being uninsured and in need of medical care. In this article, we use a life table approach to calculate health- and insurance-specific life expectancies for whites and blacks, thereby providing estimates of the duration of exposure to different insurance and health states over a typical lifetime. We find that, on average, Americans can expect to spend well over a decade without health insurance during a typical lifetime and that 40\% of these years are spent in less-healthy categories. Findings also reveal a significant racial gap: despite their shorter overall life expectancy, blacks have a longer uninsured life expectancy than whites, and this racial gap consists entirely of less-healthy years. Racial disparities in insurance coverage are thus likely more severe than indicated by previous research.	2	James B. Kirby; Toshiko Kaneda

Demography. 47:4 1053-1077.	Demography	2010	3	Multistate life table methods are often used to estimate the proportion of remaining life that individuals can expect to spend in various states, such as healthy and unhealthy states. Sullivan's method is commonly used when panels containing data on transitions are unavailable and true multistate tables,cannot be generated. Sullivan's method requires only cross-sectional mortality data and cross-sectional data indicating prevalence in states of interest. Such data often come from sample surveys, which are widely available. Although the data requirements for Sullivan's method are minimal, the method is limited in its ability to produce estimates for subpopulations because of limited disaggregation of data in cross-sectional mortality files and small cell sizes in aggregated survey data. In this article, we develop, test, and demonstrate a method that adapts Sullivan's approach to allow the inclusion of covariates in producing interval estimates of state expectancies for any desired subpopulation that can be specified in the cross-sectional prevalence data. The method involves a three-step process: (I) using Gibbs sampling to sample parameters from a bivariate regression model; (2) using ecological inference for producing transition probability matrices from the Gibbs samples; (3) using standard multistate calculations to convert the transition probability matrices into multistate life tables.	2	Scott M.

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	2	This article explains the emergence, growth, and institutional anchoring of bioethics in both policy and clinical arenas. Under the heading of principlism, bioethics developed a public language for resolving disputes that allowed it to transform disputes involving sacred matters into profane work routines. At the same time, having principlism as a common language for solving practical disputes allowed ``ethics work'' in health care to be separated from moral theorizing as a practical activity. Two issues-the right to die and the protection of research subjects-serve to illustrate the process through which bioethics established a large institutional footprint in health care.	1	Charles L.

Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:1 S80-S93.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	12	Among notable issues in health care policy and practice over the past 50 years have been those centered on the changing dynamics in clinical encounters, predominantly the relationship between physicians and patients and access to health care. Patient roles have become more active, diverse, long-term, and risk-based, while patient-provider relationships are multifaceted, less paternalistic, and more pivotal to health outcomes. Extensive literatures on help-seeking show how much social influences affect both undertreatment and inappropriate high utilization of health care. The challenge in trying to contain the growth of health care costs is two-fold: developing better ways of defining need for care and promoting better access for those who could benefit most from health care. Both of these strategies need to be considered in the context of addressing racial, ethnic, socioeconomic, and health status disparities. Rebuilding the primary care sector as a sociologically informed strategy and a key component of health care reform may optimize both health care delivery and patient outcomes.	2	Carol A.

Using symbolic interactionist concepts, as well as work from the interdisciplinary field of science and technology studies, we review and synthesize critical connections in and across sociology's intellectual relationship with medical technology. Next, we discuss key findings in these literatures, noting a shift from a focus on the effects of technology on practice to a reconfiguration of human bodies.We also look toward the future, focusing on connections between technoscientific identities and embodied health movements. Finally, we call for greater engagement by medical sociologists in studying medical technology and the process of policy-making-two areas central to debates in health economics and public policy.	2	Monica J.

Conrad, Peter & Kristin Barker. 2010. 'the Social Construction of Illness: Key Insights and Policy Implications.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:1 S67-S79.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	13	The social construction of illness is a major research perspective in medical sociology. This article traces the roots of this perspective and presents three overarching constructionist findings. First, some illnesses are particularly embedded with cultural meaning-which is not directly derived from the nature of the condition-that shapes how society responds to those afflicted and influences the experience of that illness. Second, all illnesses are socially constructed at the experiential level, based on how individuals come to understand and live with their illness. Third, medical knowledge about illness and disease is not necessarily given by nature but is constructed and developed by claims-makers and interested parties. We address central policy implications of each of these findings and discuss fruitful directions for policy-relevant research in a social constructionist tradition. Social constructionism provides an important counterpoint to medicine's largely deterministic approaches to disease and illness, and it can help us broaden policy deliberations and decisions.	2	Peter Conrad; Kristin K.

Mechanic, David & Donna McAlpine. 2010. 'Sociology of Health Care Reform: Building on Research and Analysis to Improve Health Care.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:1 S147-S159.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	5	Health reform efforts in the United States have focused on resolving some of the fundamental irrationalities of the system whereby costs and services utilization are often not linked to improved patient outcomes. Sociologists have contributed to these efforts by documenting the extent of problems and by confronting central questions around issues of accountability, reimbursement, and rationing that must be addressed in order to achieve meaningful reform that controls costs, expands access, and improves quality. Major reform rarely occurs without ``paying off'' powerful interests, a particularly difficult challenge in the context of a large and growing deficit. Central to achieving increased coverage and access, high quality, and cost control is change in reimbursement arrangements, increased accountability for both costs and outcomes, and criteria for rationing based on the evidence and accepted as legitimate by all stakeholders. Consensus about health reform requires trust. The traditional trust patients have in physicians provides an important base on which to build.	2	David Mechanic; Donna D. McAlpine
Phelan, Jo, Bruce Link & Parisa Tehranifar. 2010. 'Social Conditions as Fundamental Causes of Health Inequalities: Theory, Evidence, and Policy Implications.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:1 S28-S40.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	53	Link and Phelan (1995) developed the theory of fundamental causes to explain why the association between socioeconomic status (SES) and mortality has persisted despite radical changes in the diseases and risk factors that are presumed to explain it. They proposed that the enduring association results because SES embodies an array of resources, such as money, knowledge, prestige, power, and beneficial social connections that protect health no matter what mechanisms are relevant at any given time. In this article, we explicate the theory, review key findings, discuss refinements and limits to the theory, and discuss implications for health policies that might reduce health inequalities. We advocate policies that encourage medical and other health-promoting advances while at the same time breaking or weakening the link between these advances and socioeconomic resources. This can be accomplished either by reducing disparities in socioeconomic resources themselves or by developing interventions that, by their nature, are more equally distributed across SES groups.	3	Jo C.

Thoits, Peggy. 2010. 'Stress and Health: Major Findings and Policy Implications.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:1 S41-S53.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	63	Forty decades of sociological stress research offer five major findings. First, when stressors (negative events, chronic strains, and traumas) are measured comprehensively, their damaging impacts on physical and mental health are substantial. Second, differential exposure to stressful experiences is a primary way that gender, racial-ethnic, marital status, and social class inequalities in physical and mental health are produced. Third, minority group members are additionally harmed by discrimination stress. Fourth, stressors proliferate over the life course and across generations, widening health gaps between advantaged and disadvantaged group members. Fifth, the impacts of stressors on health and well-being are reduced when persons have high levels of mastery, self-esteem, and/or social support. With respect to policy, to help individuals cope with adversity, tried and true coping and support interventions should be more widely disseminated and employed. To address health inequalities, the structural conditions that put people at risk of stressors should be a focus of programs and policies at macro and meso levels of intervention. Programs and policies also should target children who are at lifetime risk of ill health and distress due to exposure to poverty and stressful family circumstances.	1	Peggy A. Thoits

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	15	A pressing concern in contemporary health policy is whether the medical profession's mandate to take care of clients has been undermined by the influx of money into health care. We examine the medical profession's transformation over the past decades. First, we review how sociologists have viewed the medical profession over the past half-century as one stakeholder among other stakeholders vying for market share and power in the health care field.We then examine three recent challenges to the profession that exemplify the tension between self-interest and collective altruism to act in the best interest of patients: (1) the rise of patient consumerism, (2) the advent of evidence-based medicine, and (3) the increasing power of the pharmaceutical industry. We show the resilience of the medical profession as it adapts and transforms in response to these challenges. We conclude with implications to help inform policy makers' assessments of how the medical profession will react to policy initiatives.	2	Stefan Timmermans; Hyeyoung Oh

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	34	Social relationships-both quantity and quality-affect mental health, health behavior, physical health, and mortality risk. Sociologists have played a central role in establishing the link between social relationships and health outcomes, identifying explanations for this link, and discovering social variation (e.g., by gender and race) at the population level. Studies show that social relationships have short- and long-term effects on health, for better and for worse, and that these effects emerge in childhood and cascade throughout life to foster cumulative advantage or disadvantage in health. This article describes key research themes in the study of social relationships and health, and it highlights policy implications suggested by this research.	2	Debra Umberson; Jennifer Karas Montez
Williams, David & Michelle Sternthal. 2010. 'Understanding Racial-ethnic Disparities in Health: Sociological Contributions.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:1 S15-S27.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	28	This article provides an overview of the contribution of sociologists to the study of racial and ethnic inequalities in health in the United States. It argues that sociologists have made four principal contributions. First, they have challenged and problematized the biological understanding of race. Second, they have emphasized the primacy of social structure and context as determinants of racial differences in disease. Third, they have contributed to our understanding of the multiple ways in which racism affects health. Finally, sociologists have enhanced our understanding of the ways in which migration history and status can affect health. Sociological insights on racial disparities in health have important implications for the development of effective approaches to improve health and reduce health inequities.	2	David R.

Wright, Eric & Brea Perry. 2010. 'Medical Sociology and Health Services Research: Past Accomplishments and Future Policy Challenges.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:1 S107-S119.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	5	The rising costs and inconsistent quality of health care in the United States have raised significant questions among professionals, policy makers, and the public about the way health services are being delivered. For the past 50 years, medical sociologists have made significant contributions in improving our understanding of the nature and impact of the organizations that constitute our health care system. In this article, we discuss three central findings in the sociology of health services: (1) health services in the U.S. are unequally distributed, contributing to health inequalities across status groups; (2) social institutions reproduce health care inequalities by constraining and enabling the actions of health service organizations, health care providers, and consumers; and (3) the structure and dynamics of health care organizations shape the quality, effectiveness, and outcomes of health services for different groups and communities. We conclude with a discussion of the policy implications of these findings for future health care reform efforts.	2	Eric R. Wright; Brea L. Perry
Sobieraj, Sarah. 2010. 'Reporting Conventions: Journalists, Activists, and the Thorny Struggle for Political Visibility.' Social Problems. 57:4 505-528.	Social Problems	2010	6	This article draws upon 134 in-depth interviews with activists and journalists in an effort to reconcile the extensive activism taking place in the shadows of presidential campaigns with its near invisibility in the news. In his classic work, Todd Gitlin (1980) demonstrated that activists become newsworthy only by submitting to the ``implicit rules of news making'' (p. 3). This research supports his finding, but demonstrates that unbeknownst to activists, coverage of political outsiders is governed by a set of rules quite different from (and often diametrically opposed to) those employed in routine news-gathering. Taking cues from news creation practices that go on daily between journalists, parajournalists, and subjects, activist groups work assiduously to prepare members to fit the needs of political reporters. They bend over backwards to be media-friendly, which they perceive as professional, quotable, and credible, but ironically these studied attempts to conform to the norms of routine political reporting make them less appealing to journalists. While journalists may attend eagerly to elected officials' press conferences and official statements, they demand authenticity, particularly in the form of emotion and spontaneity, from outsiders-the very attributes activists work to erase in their media trainings. In the end, the activist groups fail to obtain coverage, not because they can't conform to the rules of news making, but because they are following the wrong rules. This article maps the contradictory sets of norms at play in the negotiation over news, and shows how they work together to create nearly insurmountable cultural boundaries for political outsiders. Keywords: news, journalists, presidential campaigns, voluntary associations, social movement organizations.	1	Sarah Sobieraj
Okamoto, Dina & Kim Ebert. 2010. 'Beyond the Ballot: Immigrant Collective Action in Gateways and New Destinations in the United States.' Social Problems. 57:4 529-558.	Social Problems	2010	6	Most studies that attempt to understand immigrant political incorporation focus on patterns of electoral participation and citizenship acquisition. Given that nearly 60 percent of the foreign-born population in the United States is comprised of noncitizens, we argue that past studies miss an important dimension of the immigrant political incorporation process. In this article, we move beyond the ballot by documenting patterns of immigrant protest and conducting an analysis of the conditions under which immigrant organizing occurs in traditional gateways and new destinations. In addition to political opportunities and resources, we argue that conditions heightening group boundaries between immigrants and natives-what we call boundary markers-should play an important role in encouraging immigrants to develop a shared minority status and make collective claims on behalf of the larger group. Using hurdle models, we test our theoretical ideas with a new data set comprised of over 200 immigrant protest events in 52 metropolitan areas across the United States. Our results challenge past studies of immigrant mobilization because we find that inclusionary contexts characterized by greater access to formal political and economic incorporation both hinder and facilitate immigrant organizing, while boundary markers-measured here as threats and segregation-tend to encourage immigrant protest. Keywords: immigrant political incorporation, protest, collective action, new destinations.	2	Dina Okamoto; Kim Ebert
Brady, David, Andrew Fullerton & Jennifer Cross. 2010. 'More Than Just Nickels and Dimes: a Cross-national Analysis of Working Poverty in Affluent Democracies.' Social Problems. 57:4 559-585.	Social Problems	2010	2	Despite its centrality to contemporary inequality, working poverty is often popularly discussed but rarely studied by sociologists. Using the Luxembourg Income Study (2009), we analyze whether an individual is working poor across 18 affluent democracies circa 2000. We demonstrate that working poverty does not simply mirror overall poverty and that there is greater cross-national variation in working than overall poverty. We then examine four explanations for working poverty: demographic characteristics, economic performance, unified theory, and welfare generosity. We utilize Heckman probit models to jointly model the likelihood of employment and poverty among the employed. Our analyses provide the least support for the economic performance explanation. There is modest support for unified theory as unionization reduces working poverty in some models. However, most of these effects appear to be mediated by welfare generosity. More substantial evidence exists for the demographic characteristics and welfare generosity explanations. An individual's likelihood of being working poor can be explained by (a) a lack of multiple earners or other adults in one's household, low education, single motherhood, having children and youth; and (b) the generosity of the welfare state in which he or she resides. Also, welfare generosity does not undermine employment and reduces working poverty even among demographically vulnerable groups. Ultimately, we encourage a greater role for the welfare state in debates about working poverty. Keywords: poverty, work, working poor, social policy, labor markets.	3	David Brady; Andrew S.

Saguy, Abigail, Kjerstin Gruys & Shanna Gong. 2010. 'Social Problem Construction and National Context: News Reporting on ``overweight'' and ``obesity'' in the United States and France.' Social Problems. 57:4 586-610.	Social Problems	2010	7	Drawing on analyses of American and French news reports on ``overweight'' and ``obesity,'' this article examines how national context-including position in a global field of nation states, as well as different national politics and culture-shapes the framing of social problems. As has been shown in previous research, news reports from France-the economically dominated but culturally dominant nation of the two-discuss the United States more often than vice versa, typically in a negative way. Our contribution is to highlight the flexibility of anti-American rhetoric, which provides powerful ammunition for a variety of social problem frames. Specifically, depending on elite interests, French news reports may invoke anti-American rhetoric to reject a given phenomenon as a veritable public problem, or they may use such rhetoric to drum up concern over an issue. We further show how diverse cultural factors shape news reporting. Despite earlier work showing that a group-based discrimination frame is more common in the United States than in France, we find that the U. S. news sample is no more likely to discuss weight-based discrimination than the French news sample. We attribute this to specific barriers to this particular framing, namely the widespread view that body size is a behavior, akin to smoking, rather than an ascribed characteristic, like race. This discussion points, more generally, to some of the mechanisms limiting the diffusion of frames across social problems. Keywords: social problems, obesity, overweight, news reporting, France.	3	Abigail C. Saguy; Kjerstin Gruys; Shanna Gong
Hannon, Lance & Robert DeFina. 2010. 'the State of the Economy and the Relationship Between Prisoner Reentry and Crime.' Social Problems. 57:4 611-629.	Social Problems	2010	3	Previous research has identified a positive relationship between prisoner reentry and crime rates. The relationship potentially reflects both the recidivism of reentering offenders and the broader impact of the releases on the social organization of the areas to which they return. This article explores how economic conditions moderate the association between the size of the reentering population and crime rates. Using a state-level panel spanning the years 1978 through 2003, and two alternative measures of economic strength, the results demonstrate that the amount of increase in property and violent crime associated with prisoner societal reentry is substantially lessened by strong economic conditions. The findings suggest that economic conditions and criminal justice policies should not be pitted against each other as simply competing explanations for variation in crime rates. Instead, they should be recognized as irreducibly interdependent. Keywords: mass incarceration, prisoner reentry, crime rate, unemployment, economic conditions.	2	Lance Hannon; Robert DeFina

Social Problems	2010	1	A substantial body of research has explored the extent to which the race of offenders and victims influences who receives a death sentence for capital crimes. Little is known about how race and ethnicity might pattern death-row outcomes. Drawing upon evidence from male offenders sentenced to death in Texas during the years 1974 through 2009, we extend recent research by examining whether the race and ethnicity of offenders and victims and a number of offender, victim, and crime attributes influence the likelihood of executions and sentence relief (whereby prisoners leave death row). Cox regression analyses are used in conjunction with a multiple-imputation method for handling a modest amount of missing data. The results show that cases involving minorities-with black or Latino offenders or victims-have lower hazards of execution than cases in which both offenders and victims are white. Victim and offender race and ethnicity have little to no independent effect upon the hazard of sentence relief. Keywords: capital punishment, executions, sentence relief, race, Latinos.	2	Michelle A.

Hughey, Matthew. 2010. 'a Paradox of Participation: Nonwhites in White Sororities and Fraternities.' Social Problems. 57:4 653-679.	Social Problems	2010	3	Although law prohibits race-based exclusion in college sororities and fraternities in the United States, racial segregation prevails. As a result, nonwhite membership in white Greek-letter organizations (WGLOs) is often hailed as a transformative step toward equality and unity. The bulk of work on such cross-racial membership centers on comparative-historical and survey data and treats integrated membership as the successful end, rather than a problematic beginning, of analysis. Drawing upon in-depth interviews and ethnographic fieldwork in three university campuses on the East Coast, I shift the focus from resource factors that either prevent or enable membership to the strategies of action that nonwhite members employ in their everyday lives in order to be perceived as full, belonging members. By drawing upon the insights of the sociology of culture, I argue that robust racialized schemas simultaneously enable and constrain inclusion. Rather than hide explicit racial-ethnic difference or accede to traditional expectations of Anglo conformity, I find that nonwhite members are enmeshed in a paradox of participation: their ability to frame themselves as equal and belonging Greek ``brothers and sisters'' remains tied to a patterned reproduction of their racial and ethnic identities as essentially different and inferior. Such a paradox emerges as an important theoretical and pragmatic dilemma with implications for an array of institutional contexts. Keywords: whiteness, identity, schema, segregation, fraternity, sorority.	1	Matthew W. Hughey
Giordano, Peggy, Danielle Soto, Wendy Manning & Monica Longmore. 2010. 'the Characteristics of Romantic Relationships Associated With Teen Dating Violence.' Social Science Research. 39:6 863-874.	Social Science Research	2010	10	Studies of teen dating violence have focused heavily on family and peer influences, but little research has been conducted on the relationship contexts within which violence occurs. The present study explores specific features of adolescent romantic relationships associated with the perpetration of physical violence. Relying on personal interviews with a sample of 956 adolescents, results indicate that respondents who self-report violence perpetration are significantly more likely than their non-violent counterparts to report higher levels of other problematic relationship dynamics and behaviors such as jealousy, verbal conflict, and cheating. However, we find no significant differences in levels of love, intimate self-disclosure, or perceived partner caring, and violent relationships are, on average, characterized by longer duration, more frequent contact, sexual intimacy and higher scores on the provision and receipt of instrumental support. Finally, violence is associated with the perception of a relatively less favorable power balance, particularly among male respondents. These findings complicate traditional views of the dynamics within violent relationships, add to our understanding of risk factors, and may also shed light on why some adolescents remain in physically abusive relationships.	4	Peggy C.

Social Science Research. 39:6 894-911.	Social Science Research	2010	0	Large surveys tend to be strong on reliability and generalizability but weak on validity. The recently collected Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort, a large and representative sample of over 10,000 infants assessed at 9 and 24 months, took a provocative step toward trying to improve the validity of measures of infants' environmental conditions. Instead of relying solely on self-reported surveys, the study design employed two additional data collection methods interviewer observations and a videotaped mother/infant interaction. We assess how much additional and unique information about mothering is gained by having this extra data. The percentage of variation in infants' cognitive development we can explain with mothering behaviors doubles when using a multi-method approach versus relying solely on mothers' self-reports. However, our multi-method model of mothering still only explains about two percent of the variation in infants' cognitive development.	2	Deniz Yucel; Douglas B. Downey
Vasquez, Bob. 2010. 'Methodological Difficulties of Modeling Peer Influence.' Social Science Research. 39:6 950-962.	Social Science Research	2010	2	Using data from wave IV of the National Youth Survey, the effect of drug-related peer delinquency on delinquency is modeled as a function of the bond to peers. Due to the complexities of such a test, this article discusses limitations of both the standard linear model and Tobit regression when applied to delinquency data coupled with statistical interactions. Results from a censored least absolute deviations (CLAD) model and why this is a useful alternative to OLS and Tobit are discussed. The results suggest the effect of peers increases with the intensity of bonds to peers. However, encouragement is provided for further investigating peer influence, a process, as opposed to an additive peer effect.	1	Bob Edward Vasquez
Ruppanner, Leah. 2010. 'Cross-national Reports of Housework: an Investigation of the Gender Empowerment Measure.' Social Science Research. 39:6 963-975.	Social Science Research	2010	6	This paper analyses the relationship between country-level gender empowerment and individual-level divisions of housework. Pairing the 2004 United Nations gender empowerment measure (GEM) with individual-level (n = 18,560) data from the 2004 European Social Survey, the author compares the relationship between a country's GEM score, both as an index and as disaggregated measures, and respondents' housework hours and housework proportions. The GEM index has a positive and linear relationship with men's housework hours and a positive and non-linear relationship with men and women's housework proportions and with women's housework hours. For the disaggregated GEM measures, women's representation in parliament is positively associated with men's housework hours and proportions and women's housework hours. Women's labor market status, including the percent of women in professional positions and female-male wage ratios, is negatively associated with women's housework hours and proportions. Finally, the cross-level interactions demonstrate theoretically important relationships to the housework literature.	1	Leah E. Ruppanner
Killewald, Alexandra & Margaret Gough. 2010. 'Money Isn't Everything: Wives' Earnings and Housework Time.' Social Science Research. 39:6 987-1003.	Social Science Research	2010	6	The autonomy perspective of housework time predicts that wives' housework time falls steadily as their earnings rise, because wives use additional financial resources to outsource or forego time in housework. We argue, however, that wives' ability to reduce their housework varies by household task. That is, we expect that increases in wives' earnings will allow them to forego or outsource some tasks, but not others. As a result, we hypothesize more rapid declines in wives' housework time for low-earning wives as their earnings increase than for high-earning wives who have already stopped performing household tasks that are the easiest and cheapest to outsource or forego. Using fixed-effects models and data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we find considerable support for our hypothesis. We further conclude that past evidence that wives who out-earn their husbands spend additional time in housework to compensate for their gender-deviant success in the labor market is due to the failure to account for the non-linear relationship between wives' absolute earnings and their housework time.	2	Alexandra Killewald; Margaret Gough
DeFina, Robert & Lance Hannon. 2010. 'for Incapacitation, There Is No Time Like the Present: the Lagged Effects of Prisoner Reentry on Property and Violent Crime Rates.' Social Science Research. 39:6 1004-1014.	Social Science Research	2010	3	Previous research has suggested that prisons can both reduce and increase crime. These counterbalancing effects will have different timings. Prison reduces crime by denying those currently behind bars the opportunity to commit further offenses. However, the prison experience and the stigma of an incarceration record can be criminogenic. Once released, ex-inmates might commit more crimes than they otherwise would have. Additionally, an influx of former inmates can cause social disorganization in the community at large. Unlike incapacitation, these crime-promoting effects are not limited to the present, but are based on the proportion of the population that has experienced incarceration either in the current year or in any past year. While some previous studies have recognized the counterbalancing effects, they have only considered the contemporaneous impacts. We develop a statistical model that captures the contemporaneous and lagged effects of incarceration and reentry on property and violent crime rates. State-level panel data results (1978-2003) suggest that, with the inclusion of just 5 years of lags for incarceration and prisoner societal reentry rates, any crime-reducing benefits of increased incarceration are completely eliminated by the crime-promoting effects associated with the increasing prevalence of ex-prisoners. This conclusion is robust to several alternative specifications, including one that accounts for potential reverse causality between the crime and incarceration rates.	2	Robert DeFina; Lance Hannon
Eason, John. 2010. 'Mapping Prison Proliferation: Region, Rurality, Race and Disadvantage in Prison Placement.' Social Science Research. 39:6 1015-1028.	Social Science Research	2010	4	Perhaps the leading perspective on how and where prisons are located stems from the perspective of the prison industrial complex (PIC). Implicit, if not explicit, in the PIC perspective is the notion that Black and Hispanic prisoners are exploited for the benefit of poor, unemployed, White prison towns. Unfortunately, however, there has been a shortage of empirical scrutiny of this central notion. This paper examines this claim with a rare event logistic regression analysis of 176 new prison placements across 13,155 rural places in the 1990s in the US. In contrast to the PIC perspective, prison towns are disproportionately southern and poor, and have a larger population with a greater share of Blacks and Hispanics. The analysis yields three further challenges to the PIC perspective on prison towns. First, findings suggest rural prison placement does not cause racial and economic inequality as much as prison siting results from concentrated rural disadvantage. Second, there is not one prototypical prison town. Instead, there are typologies of prison towns based on US region, race, town population size, race, prior proximate prison, and SES. Lastly, future studies should consider the theoretical and methodological implications of rural concentrated disadvantage in measuring prison impact.	1	John Eason
Tittle, Charles, Olena Antonaccio, Ekaterina Botchkovar & Maria Kranidioti. 2010. 'Expected Utility, Self-control, Morality, and Criminal Probability.' Social Science Research. 39:6 1029-1046.	Social Science Research	2010	4	With data from random sample household surveys conducted simultaneously in major cities in Greece and in Russia, we evaluate the import of individuals' morality relative to expected utility and self-control in predicting criminal probability. In addition, we examine potential interactions among the three variables in predicting criminal propensity and compare their relative effects across the two samples. The results suggest that all three factors are important and mostly independent influences in explaining criminal probability. However, the estimated effects of morality are substantially stronger than those of either expected utility or self-control, and all three of these explanatory variables appear to be somewhat sensitive to cultural contexts. Overall, our findings confirm that morality plays a comparatively larger part in explaining conformity than is generally recognized by major contemporary theories, although the data cannot show whether morality is an element in rational decision making or represents a contrary ``non-rational'' element in accounting for human conduct.	4	Charles R.

Social Science Research. 39:6 1047-1058.	Social Science Research	2010	0	Using national data of the male population (a total of 715,000 observations) in Taiwan, this study finds a significant association between LBW and the probability of committing crime appears exclusively among those born to mothers under 18 or over 40 at the time of childbearing. Moreover, this association occurs particularly in violent crime. The interaction between biological and demographic factors suggests that being born to very old or young mothers and LBW together may create a double hazard of biological disadvantage, leading to higher risk of committing violent crime later. The other side of the coin is that, regarding to violent crime, being born low birth weight may not be a disadvantage unless it is triggered by certain adversity.	3	Wan-Chi Chen; Ming-Jen Lin; Jin-Tan Liu

Social Science Research	2010	2	This paper reports findings that assess the relationship between the resurgence in conservative political strength and union density in the United States. The conservative Republican return to political power after 1968 is likely to have produced added declines in union membership. Yet despite close political regulation of labor-management disputes, sociologists have paid little attention to the influential political determinants of success in these contests. Using fixed-effects estimation, this analysis assesses the relationship between the political strength of the political party most hostile to labor and union density. With multiple factors held constant, the results suggest that increased Republican presence in the state legislatures along with Republican control of the presidency and the governor's office after 1989 helped to reduce union memberships. The results also indicate that increases in the percentage of African Americans produces greater union strength but not in the ex-Confederate states. Added findings suggest two policies controlled by the states have influential effects on this outcome.	2	David Jacobs; Marc Dixon

Social Science Research	2010	1	This paper makes two empirical contributions to the literature on the putative effect of voluntary associations on economic activity. First, using a longitudinal database covering the entire United States, we differentiate between the effect of voluntary associations that are connected to other voluntary associations through the multiple membership of their members and voluntary associations that lack these ties. Second, we test for the existence of a conditional effect of the areal size of the spatial units under consideration, comparing results at the local community and the state level of analyses. We find that connected voluntary associations have a positive effect on the number of manufacturing establishments whereas isolated voluntary associations either have a negative effect or do not have any effect. Both local community and state level analyses reveal this pattern but the effects are stronger when the spatial unit of analysis is the local community.	2	Pino G. Audia; Atul Teckchandani
Dilks, Lisa, Shane Thye & Patricia Taylor. 2010. 'Socializing Economic Theories of Discrimination: Lessons From Survivor.' Social Science Research. 39:6 1164-1180.	Social Science Research	2010	0	This paper draws upon structural social psychological theories of small group dynamics to add predictive power to economic theories of discrimination. We first combine economic models of taste-based discrimination with social identity theory and hypothesize that discrimination is driven mainly by preferences or affinities that follow in-group/out-group boundaries. We also bring together status characteristics theory with economic views on information-based discrimination to alternatively hypothesize that discrimination is primarily driven by expectations of competency that are culturally linked to status characteristics. Predictions from both arguments are tested using data from the reality television show Survivor, a quasi-experimental setting that has compelling advantages for the study of discrimination. Specifically, we model the number of votes for elimination a contestant receives using sex, race, age, education, and group membership as explanatory variables. The results overwhelmingly support our integration of status characteristics theory and information-based models of discrimination. In the early episodes, when strategic considerations should lead contestants to value competency, low status individuals (women, minorities, and older contestants), receive more votes for elimination than high status contestants. However, as predicted from our refinement of information-based discrimination, this pattern is reversed in the later episodes. Here, when strategic considerations disfavor competency, it is high status contestants who are targeted more frequently. In contradiction to taste-based theories, discrimination tied to status characteristics is much more evident than voting according to in-group/out-group membership. We conclude by discussing the implications of our research for contemporary theories of discrimination.	3	Lisa M. Dilks; Shane R. Thye; Patricia A. Taylor
Rauhut, Heiko & Fabian Winter. 2010. 'a Sociological Perspective on Measuring Social Norms by Means of Strategy Method Experiments.' Social Science Research. 39:6 1181-1194.	Social Science Research	2010	7	The measurement of social norms plays a pivotal role in many social sciences. While economists predominantly conduct experiments, sociologists rather employ (factorial) surveys. Both methods, however, suffer from distinct weaknesses. Experiments, on the one hand, often fall short in the measurement of more complex elements, such as the conditionality or the level of consensus of social norms. Surveys, on the other, lack the ability to measure actual behavior. This paper argues that the so-called ``strategy method'' compensates for both weaknesses. We can demonstrate the applicability of the strategy method for the measurement of conditionality and consensus of fairness norms which take individual effort into account. To substantiate our claim, we present a methodological experiment comparing results for the strategy ultimatum game with those from a ``conventional'' ultimatum game. We find that offers do not differ, but the acceptance rate is substantially lower in the strategy method experiment compared to the conventional one. This confirms our theoretical expectations that strategy method experiments rather measure normative principles, whereas the ``conventional'' method the willingness to sacrifice own profits to adhere to these principles. Our results are consistent with previous comparative research between factorial surveys and observational data.	2	Heiko Rauhut; Fabian Winter
Neff, Patricia. 2010. 'Fathering an Adhd Child: an Examination of Paternal Well-being and Social Support.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:4 531-553.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	1	The purpose of this study was to examine the influence of having a child diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) on the social and emotional well-being of fathers. While mothers have been carefully scrutinized in ADHD-related literature, fathers have been largely excluded from research designs developed to explore the effects of raising a child with ADHD. Prior research has been primarily based on small, clinically referred and homogenous samples, often without comparisons or controls. This research utilizes a nationally representative sample from the 2001 U.S. National Health Interview Survey to determine differences between fathers of children with ADHD and control fathers and to analyze how the ADHD status of the child, problematic behavior, use of medication, and paternal social support influences fathers' sense of well-being. This research is also designed to determine whether there are child and family contexts in which the effect of ADHD status on paternal well-being is moderated. Contrary to previous findings about the emotional and social burden associated with raising an ADHD child, few differences between fathers were found.	1	Patricia E. Neff
Luna, Zakiya. 2010. 'Marching Toward Reproductive Justice: Coalitional (re) Framing of the March for Women's Lives.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:4 554-578.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	4	This article examines how coalition frames develop and what happens to that frame after the formal coalition ends. To that end, I analyze the frame shift around the 2004 March for Women's Lives (March). The March initially focused on established ideas of reproductive rights around which the four national mainstream co-sponsors previously organized. However, after a newer reproductive justice organization joined the coalition, material and organizing reflected a shift in framing to reproductive justice. How did this change happen? What are the impacts of this event for the women's movement? Through document analysis and interviews, I trace the negotiations that facilitated this framing shift. I argue that this new coalition frame translated into positive lasting changes in organizing for women's reproductive health even as the coalition dissolved and some of the tensions within the larger women's movement remain.	1	Zakiya T.

Schroeder, Ryan, Aurea Osgood & Michael Oghia. 2010. 'Family Transitions and Juvenile Delinquency.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:4 579-604.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	3	There is a large body of research that shows children from non-intact homes show higher rates of juvenile delinquency than children from intact homes, partially due to weaker parental control and supervision in non-intact homes. What has not been adequately addressed in the research is the influence of changes in family structure among individual adolescents over time on delinquent offending. Using the first and third waves of the National Youth Study, we assess the effect of family structure changes on changes in delinquent offending between waves through the intermediate process of changes in family time and parental attachment. Although prior research has documented adolescents in broken homes are more delinquent than youth in intact homes, the process of family dissolution is not associated with concurrent increases in offending. In contrast, family formation through marriage or cohabitation is associated with simultaneous increases in offending. Changes in family time and parental attachment account for a portion of the family formation effect on delinquency, and prior parental attachment and juvenile offending significantly condition the effect of family formation on offending.	3	Ryan D.

Silva, Jennifer & Allison Pugh. 2010. 'Beyond the Depleting Model of Parenting: Narratives of Childrearing and Change.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:4 605-627.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	3	A great deal of scholarship investigates the effects of parenting on adults who parent. While existing literature has identified the ways in which parenting affects parents adversely, we argue that more attention needs to be paid to how having children may enhance parents' lives. Thus, we draw upon twenty-four in-depth interviews with young parents in order to investigate this process. First, we identify five ways in which parents say caregiving has changed their worldviews, relationships, and expectations, leading them to 1) erect barriers, 2) aspire for more, 3) view parenthood as a second chance, 4) hew a new path, and 5) make connections. Second, we uncover two central metaphors that parents rely on to explain the effect that having responsibility for children has had on their lives: the child as witness and the child as tether. We also point to future areas of investigation, arguing that only with an adequate understanding of what parenting does to parents can we understand what changing trends in families and inequality hold for ourselves and our futures.	2	Jennifer M.

Shihadeh, Edward & Lisa Winters. 2010. 'Church, Place, and Crime: Latinos and Homicide in New Destinations.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:4 628-649.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	3	Latinos are moving beyond traditional areas and settling in new, potentially disorganized destinations. Without an established immigrant community, new destinations appear to rely more on the local religious ecology to regulate community life and to keep crime low. We examine the link between religious ecology and Latino homicide victimization for traditional and new destination counties. We observe four findings. (1) A Catholic presence has no effect on Latino violence in the old and well-organized traditional settlement areas. But in new Latino settlement areas, a Catholic presence substantially lowers violence against Latinos. In contrast, mainline Protestantism is linked to high levels of violence against Latinos in new destinations. (2) Previous claims that Latino communities are safe do not apply to new destinations, where Latinos are murdered at a high rate. (3) Previous claims that areas with high Latino immigration are safe for Latinos are not true for new destinations. (4) New Latino destinations offer little insulation from the effects of economic deprivation on violence. We discuss the implications of the findings.	2	Edward S. Shihadeh; Lisa Winters

Bollen, Kenneth & Shawn Bauldry. 2010. 'Model Identification and Computer Algebra.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 39:2 127-156.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	1	Multiequation models that contain observed or latent variables are common in the social sciences. To determine whether unique parameter values exist for such models, one needs to assess model identification. In practice, analysts rely on empirical checks that evaluate the singularity of the information matrix evaluated at sample estimates of parameters. The discrepancy between estimates and population values, the limitations of numerical assessments of ranks, and the difference between local and global identification make this practice less than perfect. In this article, the authors outline how to use computer algebra systems (CAS) to determine the local and global identification of multiequation models with or without latent variables. They demonstrate a symbolic CAS approach to local identification and develop a CAS approach to obtain explicit algebraic solutions for each of the model parameters. The authors illustrate the procedures with several examples, including a new proof of the identification of a model for handling missing data using auxiliary variables. They present an identification procedure for structural equation models that makes use of CAS and that is a useful complement to current methods.	2	Kenneth A. Bollen; Shawn Bauldry
Powers, Daniel. 2010. 'Assessing Group Differences in Estimated Baseline Survivor Functions From Cox Proportional Hazards Models.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 39:2 157-187.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	0	The author discusses the general problem of evaluating differences in adjusted survivor functions and develops a heuristic approach to generate the expected events that would occur under a Cox proportional hazards model. Differences in the resulting expected survivor distributions can be tested using generalized log rank tests. This method should prove useful for making other kinds of comparisons and generating adjusted life tables. The author also discusses alternative specifications of the classical Cox model that allow time-varying effects and thus permit a more direct assessment of group differences at various points in time. He implements recently developed semiparametric approaches for estimating time-varying effects, which permit statistical tests of group difference in effects as well as tests of time-invariant effects. He shows that these approaches can provide insight into the nature of time-varying effects and can help reveal the temporal dynamic of group differences.	1	Daniel A. Powers
Luo, Wen & Oi-Man Kwok. 2010. 'Proportional Reduction of Prediction Error in Cross-classified Random Effects Models.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 39:2 188-205.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	1	As an extension of hierarchical linear models (HLMs), cross-classified random effects models (CCREMs) are used for analyzing multilevel data that do not have strictly hierarchical structures. Proportional reduction in prediction error, a multilevel version of the R(2) in ordinary multiple regression, measures the predictive ability of a model and is useful in model selection. However, such a measure is not yet available for CCREMs. Using a two-level random-intercept CCREM, the authors have investigated how the estimated variance components change when predictors are added and have extended the measures of proportional reduction in prediction error from HLMs to CCREMs. The extended measures are generally unbiased for both balanced and unbalanced designs. An example is provided to illustrate the computation and interpretation of these measures in CCREMs.	2	Wen Luo; Oi-Man Kwok

Ip, Edward, Alison Jones, D. Heckert, Qiang Zhang & Edward Gondolf. 2010. 'Latent Markov Model for Analyzing Temporal Configuration for Violence Profiles and Trajectories in a Sample of Batterers.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 39:2 222-255.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	4	In this article, the authors demonstrate the utility of an extended latent Markov model for analyzing temporal configurations in the behaviors of a sample of 550 domestic violence batterers. Domestic violence research indicates that victims experience a constellation of abusive behaviors rather than a single type of violent outcome. There is also evidence that observed behaviors are highly dynamic, with batterers cycling back and forth between periods of no abuse and violent or controlling behavior. These issues pose methodological challenges for social scientists. The extended latent Markov method uses multiple indicators to characterize batterer behaviors and relates the trajectories of violent states to predictors of abuse at baseline. The authors discuss both methodological refinements of the latent Markov models and policy implications of the data analysis.	5	Edward H. Ip; Alison Snow Jones; D.

'a Cautionary Note on the Use of Matching to Estimate Causal Effects: an Empirical Example Comparing Matching Estimates to an Experimental Benchmark.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 39:2 256-282.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	4	In recent years, social scientists have increasingly turned to matching as a method for drawing causal inferences from observational data. Matching compares those who receive a treatment to those with similar background attributes who do not receive a treatment. Researchers who use matching frequently tout its ability to reduce bias, particularly when applied to data sets that contain extensive background information. Drawing on a randomized voter mobilization experiment, the authors compare estimates generated by matching to an experimental benchmark. The enormous sample size enables the authors to exactly match each treated subject to 40 untreated subjects. Matching greatly exaggerates the effectiveness of pre-election phone calls encouraging voter participation. Moreover, it can produce nonsensical results: Matching suggests that another pre-election phone call that encouraged people to wear their seat belts also generated huge increases in voter turnout. This illustration suggests that caution is warranted when applying matching estimators to observational data, particularly when one is uncertain about the potential for biased inference.	3	Kevin Arceneaux; Alan S.

Peeters, Carel, Gerty Lensvelt-Mulders & Karin Lasthuizen. 2010. 'a Note on a Simple and Practical Randomized Response Framework for Eliciting Sensitive Dichotomous and Quantitative Information.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 39:2 283-296.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	3	Many issues of interest to social scientists and policy makers are of a sensitive nature in the sense that they are intrusive, stigmatizing, or incriminating to the respondent. This results in refusals to cooperate or evasive cooperation in studies using self-reports. In a seminal article, Warner (1965) proposed to curb this problem by generating an artificial variability in responses to inoculate the individual meaning of answers to sensitive questions. This procedure was further developed and extended and came to be known as the randomized response (RR) technique. Here, the authors propose a unified treatment for eliciting sensitive binary as well as quantitative information with RR based on a model where the inoculating elements are provided for by the randomization device. The procedure is simple and the authors will argue that its implementation in a computer-assisted setting may have superior practical capabilities.	3	Carel F. Peeters; Gerty J.

Hughes, Alison. 2010. 'the Challenge of Contributing to Policy Making in Primary Care: the Gendered Experiences and Strategies of Nurses.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:7 977-992.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	0	This paper explores nurses' experiences as members of primary care organisations set up to develop and commission health services for local communities. Nurses, alongside GPs and other health professionals, were given a place on the governing bodies (boards) of Local Health Groups - a move widely welcomed by the nursing profession as long overdue recognition of the important contribution nurses and nursing could bring to the policy arena. Nurse board members faced a number of challenges in their attempts to contribute to and influence local health policy. This ethnographic study (which involved non-participant observation of 33 board meetings and interviews with 29 board members including nurses) suggests that medical authority and control, and hierarchical power relations between doctors and nurses on the board, were seen by nurses as significant obstacles to their participation in this new policy arena. In response to their perceived lack of power and subordinate status, nurses employed a number of strategies to negotiate their participation as board members - these included `getting it right', `achieving the right balance', `self-presentation' and `unassertiveness'. These strategies reflected and reproduced gendered identities and relations of power and raise important questions regarding the influence of nurses and nursing within policy making.	1	Alison Hughes
Carter, Shannon. 2010. 'Beyond Control: Body and Self in Women's Childbearing Narratives.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:7 993-1009.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	3	In the United States, childbearing is often conceptualised as a time when women lose self-control over their bodies. This project examines issues of bodily control through a social constructionist analysis of in-depth interviews with 18 predominantly white, working and middle class women who have recently given birth in the US. Findings indicate that many participants construct themselves as both in and out of control of their bodies during childbearing. Participants also describe body/self relationships in ways that transcend power and control, perceiving the body as autonomous, accommodating and collaborating. Accommodating and collaborating bodies were described here only among participants who gave birth in the midwifery model of care. The findings illuminate various ways of conceptualising the body and point to the use of different bodily discourses by women who give birth in medical and midwifery models.	1	Shannon K. Carter

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	1	In New Zealand, as in other industrialised nations, rates of work-related gradual onset injuries increased during the 1980s and 1990s. The perspectives and experiences of workers suffering what became known as occupational overuse injuries in New Zealand offer insights into local lived political economies. Here, we explore the dominant metaphor, `battling', in participants' narratives. On the face of it, battles were fought over diagnoses, over occupational health and safety in the workplace, and over entitlements to therapy and income compensation. However, participants were also battling to maintain their identities as hard workers, while resisting and challenging normalising technologies of self and morally charged negative identities offered them by employers, state-funded accident and injury insurance agencies, and the medical profession. Inherent in their narratives is a critique of the neo-liberal capitalist political economy that allows workers' bodies to be exploited (and sacrificed) for employers' profits.	2	Chrystal Jaye; Ruth Fitzgerald
Phillips, Tarryn. 2010. 'Debating the Legitimacy of a Contested Environmental Illness: a Case Study of Multiple Chemical Sensitivities (mcs).' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:7 1026-1040.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	1	More than 20 years after it was first identified, the anomalous condition, multiple chemical sensitivities (MCS), remains immersed in controversy, with a continuing debate over its causation being played out in the medico-scientific community and in the courts. This article examines why sceptical and supportive experts disagree over the condition's legitimacy as an organic condition. Drawing on ethnographic research conducted in Perth, Western Australia, the author scrutinises the decision-making practices of 16 experts (eight sceptical and eight supportive of a chemical explanation). Both groups were found to use evidence-based, inductive reasoning. However, sceptical experts tended to use a different set of evidence requirements, exhibited more faith in the efficiency of the current biomedical paradigm regarding toxicity and were less likely to acknowledge uncertainty in their field. All the experts recognised a spectrum of beliefs about the causal mechanisms of MCS. However, when they were engaged in litigation as expert witnesses due to their supportive or sceptical tendency, the oppositional legal system polarised their opinions and exacerbated the perceived divide between them. Ultimately, the adversarial medico-legal process inhibits genuine dialogue between some of the key players in the MCS debate, thus impeding understanding and consensus about the condition.	1	Tarryn Phillips
Balfe, Myles & Ruairi Brugha. 2010. 'Disclosure of Sti Testing Activities by Young Adults: the Influence of Emotions and Social Networks.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:7 1041-1058.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	1	Thirty young adults (between 18 and 29 years of age) who had sought STI testing were interviewed about their experiences of `passing' during the STI testing process (keeping their testing practices a secret from other individuals), and also their experiences of disclosing to other individuals the fact that they had sought STI testing. Respondents kept their STI testing practices secret from others in order to preserve their identities as `normal' individuals. They feared that their identities would become stigmatised if other people were to find out about their testing practices. Keeping their practices a secret was difficult and emotionally draining. Consequently, respondents usually chose to inform a few key individuals about their testing activities. These individuals provided respondents with emotional support and helped them to pass as normal. Healthcare professionals were a particular, valued group to whom respondents disclosed their need for STI testing. A number of respondents reported experiencing stigmatising reactions from healthcare professionals, however, which had deleterious consequences for these respondents' willingness to seek treatment for their STI. Findings are discussed in relation to Goffman's impression management framework (1959, 1963) and develop Goffman's work by highlighting the roles played by emotions and social networks in impression management activities.	2	Myles Balfe; Ruairi Brugha

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	0	Although texts recommend the generation of rich data from interviews, no empirical evidence base exists for achieving this. This study aimed to operationalise richness and to assess which components of the interview (for example, topic, interviewee, question) were predictive. A total of 400 interview questions and their corresponding responses were selected from 10 qualitative studies in the area of health identified from university colleagues and the UK Data Archive database. The analysis used the text analysis program, Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count, and additional rating scales. Richness was operationalised along five dimensions. `Length of response' was predicted by a personal, less specific or positive topic, not being a layperson, later questions, open or double questions; `personal richness' was predicted by being a healthy participant and questions about the past and future; `analytical responses' were predicted by a personal or less specific topic, not being a layperson, later questions, questions relating to insight and causation; `action responses' were predicted by a less specific topic, not being a layperson, being healthy, later and open questions. The model for `descriptive richness' was not significant. Overall, open questions, located later on and framed in the present or past tense, tended to be most predictive of richness. This could inform improvements in interview technique.	2	Jane Ogden; Danielle Cornwell
Pickard, Susan. 2010. 'the Role of Governmentality in the Establishment, Maintenance and Demise of Professional Jurisdictions: the Case of Geriatric Medicine.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:7 1072-1086.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	2	This paper examines the professionalising of geriatric medicine in the UK roughly between the 1940s and the 1970s and locates it in terms of the broader context of the relationship between the professions and the state. It looks at how this relationship shaped geriatric medicine's professional jurisdiction, including the discourses of expertise on the one hand and the constituting of the `subjects' of such expertise on the other. In contrast to other sociological approaches to the professions, which highlight the negative impact of state encroachment on professional territory, this paper contends that without the backing of the Ministry of Health the specialty may never have established itself in the face of prolonged opposition from rival specialists. However, such support was predicated on the specialty's highlighting particular legitimating discourses and practices at the expense of others, and in framing this in terms of specific policy concerns around an ageing population. Whilst this imprinted the profession with the stamp of governmentality, it also contributed to the broader problematising of old age in the twentieth century. The paper concludes by considering the legacy of this context of professionalisation for the profession today.	1	Susan Pickard
Katainen, Anu. 2010. 'Social Class Differences in the Accounts of Smoking - Striving for Distinction?.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:7 1087-1101.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	6	The dominant trend in smoking prevalence in most Western countries is its increasing association with lower socioeconomic positions, making it a major factor behind inequalities in health. This paper focuses on the reasoning behind smoking, as well as on its social significance among middle-class and working-class smokers. The data consist of 55 semi-structured interviews with daily smokers, ex-smokers and occasional smokers from different occupational backgrounds. The analysis revealed considerable differences in the ways of accounting for smoking, relating to the respondents' occupational backgrounds. Contrary to expectations, non-manual workers tended to consider their smoking functional, pleasurable and controlled, whereas the opposite was the case with the manual workers. Despite the high prevalence of smoking in that group, they were least willing to justify or rationalise their behaviour, whereas the agenda of middle-class smokers could be interpreted as the reconciliation of middle-class habitus with a risky, working-class habit.	1	Anu Katainen
Dahl, Espen & Ira Malmberg-Heimonen. 2010. 'Social Inequality and Health: the Role of Social Capital.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:7 1102-1119.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	8	The aim of the article is to examine whether and to what degree the unequal distribution of social capital in the population explains the relationship between socioeconomic position and health in Norway. Theoretical insight and empirical evidence seem to suggest that social capital mediates the effect of socioeconomic position on health outcomes. However, only a few studies have addressed this question and those that have done so have used few and simple indicators of social capital. This study is based on a nationwide cross-sectional survey (N = 3190) commissioned by Statistics Norway. The survey was designed to cover a comprehensive set of variables measuring different aspects of the theoretical construct of social capital. Two health outcomes, self-perceived health and longstanding illness, were analysed. The results showed that the mediating role of social capital between socioeconomic position and health was negligible for both health outcomes. After controlling for socio-demographic variables and socioeconomic position, only neighbourhood satisfaction and generalised trust showed a significant association with self-perceived health, whereas none of the social capital variables had any significant association with longstanding illness. Some theoretical and methodological implications of the results are discussed.	2	Espen Dahl; Ira Malmberg-Heimonen

Theory and Society. 39:6 593-629.	Theory and Society	2010	0	At the heart of this article is a structural approach to narrative, based on the work of Propp, Labov, van Dijk, Halliday, and others. The article highlights the structural features of narrative-basically, the organization of the genre around the semantic template actor-action-actor (syntactically rendered as subject-verb-object but where, in narrative, the subject is typically a social actor and the verb a social action) and the modifiers of each element of this triplet, such as time and space of action-and shows how to implement this structure in a computer environment and how to use this methodological tool in socio-historical research (namely, the rise of Italian fascism, 1919-22). But, taking a cue from Halliday's cover jacket of his An Introduction to Functional Grammar, with its representation of a color circle, the paper takes the reader on an intellectual journey from Newton to Goethe-and the quality versus quantity debate-to Goethe and Propp, to end, back home, with Simmel and Weber.	1	Roberto P.

Gregg, Benjamin. 2010. 'Individuals as Authors of Human Rights: Not Only Addressees.' Theory and Society. 39:6 631-650.	Theory and Society	2010	0	I propose human rights as self-authored through a personality structure of ``assertive selfhood.'' To that end I identify three features of self-authorship: emergent through collective political action; as a critical stance; and borne by non-idiosyncratic norms. So conceived, human rights require a field of recognition as a social structure supportive of claims to assertive selfhood. I show that the capacity to self-grant depends critically on the participant's personality structure as well as on the structure of some of the social institutions he or she inhabits. But like any political vision, the project for self-granted human rights has distinct limits, above all with respect to the many inequalities among potential self-authors.	1	Benjamin Gregg
Lizardo, Omar. 2010. 'Beyond the Antinomies of Structure: Levi-strauss, Giddens, Bourdieu, and Sewell.' Theory and Society. 39:6 651-688.	Theory and Society	2010	3	In this article, I attempt to address some enduring problems in formulation and practical use of the notion of structure in contemporary social science. I begin by revisiting the question of the fidelity of Anthony Giddens' appropriation of the idea of structure with respect to Levi-Strauss. This requires a reconsideration of Levi-Strauss' original conceptualization of ``social structure'' which I argue is a sort of ``methodological structuralism'' that stands sharply opposed to Giddens' ontological reconceptualization of the notion. I go on to show that Bourdieu's contemporaneous critique of Levi-Strauss is best understood as an attempt to recover rather than reject the central implication of Levi-Strauss' methodological structuralism, which puts Bourdieu and Giddens on clearly distinct camps in terms of their approach toward the idea of structure. To demonstrate the-insurmountable-conceptual difficulties inherent in the ontological approach, I proceed by critically examining what I consider to be the most influential attempt to resolve the ambiguities in Giddens structuration theory: Sewell's argument for the ``duality of structure.'' I show that by retaining Giddens' ontological focus, Sewell ends up with a notion of structure that is at its very core ``anti-structuralist'' or only structuralist in a weak sense. I close by considering the implications of the analysis for the possibility of developing the rather neglected ``methodological structuralist'' legacy in contemporary social analysis.	1	Omar Lizardo
Byron, Reginald. 2010. 'Discrimination, Complexity, and the Public/private Sector Question.' Work and Occupations. 37:4 435-475.	Work and Occupations	2010	5	Does employment discrimination vary in degree or character across public and private labor market sectors? Prior research cannot fully address this question because it typically relies on one dimension of discrimination- estimates of wage gaps. This study extends the literature by analyzing 11,528 legally verified cases of race and sex discrimination from the Ohio Civil Rights Commission (1986-2003). Quantitative analyses demonstrate that aggregate rates of verified discrimination vary little by sector, yet there are elevated rates of public sector promotion discrimination and elevated rates of private sector firing discrimination. In-depth qualitative analyses show that specific sectoral processes contribute to these aggregate patterns. In the public sector, limited accountability for promotion decisions allows managers to devalue seniority, augment ``soft skills,'' and sabotage multiple stages of formalized proceedings. Moreover, the very devices intended to curb discriminatory promotion may inadvertently multiply the stages for bias to enter decisions. In the private sector, managers exploit the latitude afforded by the employment-at-will doctrine to differentially terminate workers, sometimes justifying their actions as cost saving in a competitive market. The author argues that these processes are in line with statistical discrimination and social closure theories and concludes by discussing their implications for understandings of workplace inequality.	1	Reginald A.

Work and Occupations	2010	3	Mismatches between Americans' actual and preferred hours of paid work are common, but the understanding of such mismatches is still limited. In this article, the authors provide the first large-scale, longitudinal study of hour mismatches in the United States. They found that the population of workers with hour mismatches is in constant flux. Nevertheless, hour mismatches seem to persist for long periods of time: The vast majority of respondents who wanted fewer hours when first interviewed still wanted fewer hours 5 years later. The authors also found inequalities in the methods through which people develop and resolve mismatches. Women who want fewer hours were less likely than men to resolve their mismatches by working less. Also, they found evidence suggesting that non-Whites who want fewer hours may be settling for the hours they can get rather than getting the hours they want.	2	Jeremy Reynolds; Lydia Aletraris
Ready, Douglas. 2010. 'Socioeconomic Disadvantage, School Attendance, and Early Cognitive Development: the Differential Effects of School Exposure.' Sociology of Education. 83:4 271-286.	Sociology of Education	2010	3	Over the past several decades, research has documented strong relationships between social class and children's cognitive abilities. These initial cognitive differences, which are substantial at school entry, increase as children progress through school. Despite the robust findings associated with this research, authors have generally neglected the extent to which school absenteeism exacerbates social class differences in academic development among young children. Using growth-curve analyses within a three-level hierarchical linear modeling framework, this study employs data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K) to examine the links between children's social class, school absences, and academic growth during kindergarten and first grade. Results suggest that the effects of schooling on cognitive development are stronger for lower socioeconomic status (SES) children and that the findings associated with theories of summer learning loss are applicable to literacy development during early elementary school. Indeed, although they continue to achieve at lower absolute levels, socioeconomically disadvantaged children who have good attendance rates gain more literacy skills than their higher SES peers during kindergarten and first grade.	1	Douglas D.

Sociology of Education	2010	6	Scholars hypothesize that both neighborhood and school contexts influence educational attainment, but few have considered both contexts simultaneously. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the author analyzes how school and neighborhood contexts are jointly related to high school and college graduation. She finds that the absolute level of neighborhood resources positively predicts earning a bachelor's degree, while relative neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) compared to school peers' neighborhood SES predicts high school graduation. Interactions between school and neighborhood characteristics reveal that low odds of educational attainment among students from lower-SES neighborhoods are reduced even more when a student attends school with more white and high-SES peers. Conversely, the high odds of educational attainment among students from higher-SES neighborhoods are further enhanced by attending school with more white and high-SES peers. Findings suggest that neighborhood SES may be a basis for relative deprivation within schools. Policy makers need to determine how students from different neighborhoods are integrated into a school's structure and culture in order for policies that mix students from different neighborhood backgrounds to succeed. Attending a high-SES, largely white school does not eliminate (and may even exacerbate) the disadvantages of coming from a low-SES neighborhood.	1	Ann Owens
Hibel, Jacob, George Farkas & Paul Morgan. 2010. 'Who Is Placed Into Special Education?.' Sociology of Education. 83:4 312-332.	Sociology of Education	2010	11	The authors use nationally representative data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999 (ECLS-K) to identify variables measured in the fall of 1998 (when the sample's students were in kindergarten) that predict special education placement by the spring of 2004 (when most students were finishing fifth grade). Placement's strongest kindergarten predictor is a student's level of academic achievement. Also important is the student's frequency of classroom task engagement. There is a `'frog-pond'' contextual effect-attending an elementary school with high levels of overall student academic ability and behavior increases a student's likelihood of special education placement. This is the case even after statistically controlling for a wide range of individual-, family-, and school-level characteristics. Social class background displayed a weak or statistically nonsignificant relation with special education placement. However, girls are placed less frequently than boys. African American, Hispanic, and Asian students are placed less frequently than non-Hispanic whites. The under- or equal-placement rates for racial/ethnic minorities are partially explained by their concentration in high-minority schools.	3	Jacob Hibel; George Farkas; Paul L. Morgan
Thijs, Jochem, Maykel Verkuyten & Petra Helmond. 2010. 'a Further Examination of the Big-fish-little-pond Effect: Perceived Position in Class, Class Size, and Gender Comparisons.' Sociology of Education. 83:4 333-345.	Sociology of Education	2010	2	Among early adolescents (10-12 years) in the Netherlands, this study examined the academic self-concept in terms of the big-fish-little-pond effect (BFLPE). The BFLPE implies that students in classes where the average achievement is low will have a higher academic self-concept than equally achieving students in classes where the average achievement is high. The social comparison process assumed to underlie this effect was examined by focusing on classmates' average achievement and the perceived relative achievement position in the school class. It was found that the perceived class position mediated the relationship between classmates' achievement and the academic self-concept. In addition, the effect of classmates' achievement on perceived relative academic position was stronger in smaller compared to larger classes. Furthermore, it was investigated whether classmates' gender was differently important for social comparison processes in the academic domain. It turned out that students' academic self-concept was affected by the achievements of same-gender classmates. Achievements of opposite-gender classmates only had an effect on the academic self-concept when the number of these classmates was small. The findings of this study support the theoretical principles underlying the big-fish-little-pond effect and are relevant for debates about class sizes and the utility of academic selective schooling.	3	Jochem Thijs; Maykel Verkuyten; Petra Helmond
Kristal, Tali. 2010. 'Good Times, Bad Times: Postwar Labor's Share of National Income in Capitalist Democracies.' American Sociological Review. 75:5 729-763.	American Sociological Review	2010	7	This article returns to a classic question of political economy: the zero-sum conflict between capital and labor over the division of the national income pie. A detailed description of labor's share of national income in 16 industrialized democracies from 1960 to 2005 uncovers two long-term trends: an increase in labor's share in the aftermath of World War II, followed by a decrease since the early 1980s. I argue that the working class's relative bargaining power explains the dynamics of labor's share, and I model inter- and intra-class bargaining power in the economic, political, and global spheres. Time-series cross-section equations predicting the short- and long-term determinants of labor's share support most of my theoretical arguments and the main findings are robust to alternative specifications. Results suggest that the common trend in the dynamics of labor's share of national income is largely explained by indicators for working-class organizational power in the economic (i.e., unionization and strike activity) and political (i.e., government civilian spending) spheres, working-class structural power in the global sphere (i.e., southern imports and foreign direct investments), and indirectly by an indicator for working-class integration in the intra-class sphere (i.e., bargaining centralization).	1	Tali Kristal
Rugh, Jacob & Douglas Massey. 2010. 'Racial Segregation and the American Foreclosure Crisis.' American Sociological Review. 75:5 629-651.	American Sociological Review	2010	46	The rise in subprime lending and the ensuing wave of foreclosures was partly a result of market forces that have been well-identified in the literature, but it was also a highly racialized process. We argue that residential segregation created a unique niche of minority clients who were differentially marketed risky subprime loans that were in great demand for use in mortgage-backed securities that could be sold on secondary markets. We test this argument by regressing foreclosure actions in the top 100 U.S. metropolitan areas on measures of black, Hispanic, and Asian segregation while controlling for a variety of housing market conditions, including average creditworthiness, the extent of coverage under the Community Reinvestment Act, the degree of zoning regulation, and the overall rate of subprime lending. We find that black residential dissimilarity and spatial isolation are powerful predictors of foreclosures across U.S. metropolitan areas. To isolate subprime lending as the causal mechanism through which segregation influences foreclosures, we estimate a two-stage least squares model that confirms the causal effect of black segregation on the number and rate of foreclosures across metropolitan areas. We thus conclude that segregation was an important contributing cause of the foreclosure crisis, along with overbuilding, risky lending practices, lax regulation, and the bursting of the housing price bubble.	2	Jacob S.

Villarreal, Andres. 2010. 'Stratification by Skin Color in Contemporary Mexico.' American Sociological Review. 75:5 652-678.	American Sociological Review	2010	12	Latin America is often used as a backdrop against which U.S. race relations are compared. Yet research on race in Latin America focuses almost exclusively on countries in the region with a large recognized presence of individuals of African descent such as Brazil. Racial categories in these countries are based on skin color distinctions along a black-white continuum. By contrast, the main socially recognized ethnic distinction in Indo-Latin American countries such as Mexico, between indigenous and non-indigenous residents, is not based primarily on phenotypical differences, but rather on cultural practices and language use. Many Mexicans today nevertheless express a preference for whiter skin and European features, even though no clear system of skin color categorization appears to exist. In this study, I use data from a nationally-representative panel survey of Mexican adults to examine the extent of skin-color-based social stratification in contemporary Mexico. Despite extreme ambiguity in skin color classification, I find considerable agreement among survey interviewers about who belongs to three skin color categories. The results also provide evidence of profound social stratification by skin color. Individuals with darker skin tone have significantly lower levels of educational attainment and occupational status, and they are more likely to live in poverty and less likely to be affluent, even after controlling for other individual characteristics.	1	Andres Villarreal
Logan, Trevon. 2010. 'Personal Characteristics, Sexual Behaviors, and Male Sex Work: a Quantitative Approach.' American Sociological Review. 75:5 679-704.	American Sociological Review	2010	7	Male sex workers serve multiple groups (i.e., gay-identified men, heterosexually-identified men, and their own sexual partners), making them a unique source to test theories of gender, masculinity, and sexuality. To date, most scholarship on this topic has been qualitative. I assembled a dataset from the largest online male sex worker website to conduct the first quantitative analysis of male escorts in the United States. I find the geographic distribution of male sex workers is more strongly correlated with the general population than with the gay male population. In addition, I estimate the value of sexual behaviors and personal characteristics in this market to test sociological theories of gender and masculinity. Consistent with hegemonic masculinity, I find that male escorts who advertise masculine behavior charge higher prices for their services, whereas escorts who advertise less masculine behavior charge significantly less, a differential on the order of 17 percent. Results show that race and sexual behavior interactions exert a strong influence on prices charged by male sex workers, confirming aspects of intersectionality theory.	1	Trevon D. Logan
Budig, Michelle & Melissa Hodges. 2010. 'Differences in Disadvantage: Variation in the Motherhood Penalty Across White Women's Earnings Distribution.' American Sociological Review. 75:5 705-728.	American Sociological Review	2010	19	Earnings inequality has grown in recent decades in the United States, yet research investigating the motherhood wage penalty has not fully considered how the penalty itself, and the mechanisms producing it, may vary among low-wage, middle-wage, and high-wage workers. Pooling data from the 1979 to 2004 waves of the NLSY and using simultaneous quantile regression methods with fixed effects, we test whether the size of the motherhood penalty differs across the distribution of white women's earnings, and whether the mechanisms explaining this penalty vary by earnings level. Results show that having children inflicts the largest penalty on low-wage women, proportionately, although a significant motherhood penalty persists at all earnings levels. We also find that the mechanisms creating the motherhood penalty vary by earnings level. Family resources, work effort, and compensating differentials account for a greater portion of the penalty among low earners. Among highly paid women, by contrast, the motherhood penalty is significantly smaller and largely explained by lost human capital due to childbearing. Our findings show that estimates of average motherhood penalties obscure the compounded disadvantage mothers face at the bottom of the earnings distribution, as well as differences in the type and strength of mechanisms that produce the penalty.	2	Michelle J.

Wimmer, Andreas & Yuval Feinstein. 2010. 'the Rise of the Nation-state Across the World, 1816 to 2001.' American Sociological Review. 75:5 764-790.	American Sociological Review	2010	8	Why did the nation-state proliferate across the world over the past 200 years, replacing empires, kingdoms, city-states, and the like? Using a new dataset with information on 145 of today's states from 1816 to the year they achieved nation-statehood, we test key aspects of modernization, world polity, and historical institutionalist theories. Event history analysis shows that a nation-state is more likely to emerge when a power shift allows nationalists to overthrow or absorb the established regime. Diffusion of the nation-state within an empire or among neighbors also tilts the balance of power in favor of nationalists. We find no evidence for the effects of industrialization, the advent of mass literacy, or increasingly direct rule, which are associated with the modernization theories of Gellner, Anderson, Tilly, and Hechter. Nor is the growing global hegemony of the nation-state model a good predictor of individual instances of nation-state formation, as Meyer's world polity theory would suggest. We conclude that the global rise of the nation-state is driven by proximate and contextual political factors situated at the local and regional levels, in line with historical institutionalist arguments, rather than by domestic or global structural forces that operate over the long duree.	2	Andreas Wimmer; Yuval Feinstein
Maynard, Douglas, Jeremy Freese & Nora Schaeffer. 2010. 'Calling for Participation: Requests, Blocking Moves, and Rational (inter)action in Survey Introductions.' American Sociological Review. 75:5 791-814.	American Sociological Review	2010	4	We draw on conversation analytic methods and research to explicate the interactional phenomenon of requesting in general and the specific case of requesting participation in survey interviews. Recent work on survey participation gives much attention to leverage-saliency theory but does not explore how the key concepts of this theory are exhibited in the actual unfolding interaction of interviewers and potential respondents. We examine interaction using digitally recorded and transcribed calls to recruit participation in the 2004 Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. We describe how potential respondents present interactional environments that are relatively discouraging or encouraging, and how, in response, interviewers may be relatively cautious or presumptive in their requesting actions. We consider how interviewers' ability to tailor their behavior to their interactional environments can affect whether an introduction reaches the point at which a request to participate is made, the form that this request takes, and the sample person's response. This article contributes to understanding the social action of requesting and specifically how we might use insights from analyses of interaction to increase cooperation with requests to participate in surveys.	3	Douglas W.

Weigt, Jill. 2010. '``i Feel Like It's a Heavier Burden ... `` the Gendered Contours of Heterosexual Partnering After Welfare Reform.' Gender \& Society. 24:5 565-590.	Gender \& Society	2010	0	One of the explicit goals of the 1996 welfare reform in the United States was to create conditions that would encourage marriage as a means of reducing poverty and welfare ``dependency.'' With the exception of a few notable studies that examine reliance on abusive partners and former partners, relatively little scholarly attention has been given to the contours of partnering after welfare reform. Using a feminist lens on data from two qualitative studies, the author examines the partnership experiences of a sample of mostly white women three to four years after they had left welfare. An exploration of women's views of their transitions into and their experiences with partnering reveals that women (re) align with a logic of heterosexual partnering that holds the potential to complicate their lives. The analysis sounds a precautionary note and provides empirical evidence that partnering in the context of the reduced options of welfare reform can diminish women's long-term stability and that encouraging partnering is, ultimately, an unsustainable policy direction for the support of lone mothers.	1	Jill Weigt
Cairns, Kate, Josee Johnston & Shyon Baumann. 2010. 'Caring About Food Doing Gender in the Foodie Kitchen.' Gender \& Society. 24:5 591-615.	Gender \& Society	2010	6	This article draws on interviews with ``foodies''-people with a passion for eating and learning about food-to explore questions of gender and foodie culture. The analysis suggests that while this culture is by no means gender-neutral, foodies are enacting gender in ways that warrant closer inspection. This article puts forward new empirical findings about gender and food and employs the concept of ``doing gender'' to explore how masculinities and femininities are negotiated in foodie culture. Our focus on doing gender generates two insights into gender and food work. First, we find that doing gender has different implications for men and women within foodie culture. Alongside evidence that foodies are contesting particular gendered relations within the food world, we explore how broader gender inequities persist. Second, we contend that opportunities for doing gender in foodie culture cannot be considered apart from class privilege.	3	Kate Cairns; Josee Johnston; Shyon Baumann
Benard, Stephen & Shelley Correll. 2010. 'Normative Discrimination and the Motherhood Penalty.' Gender \& Society. 24:5 616-646.	Gender \& Society	2010	13	This research proposes and tests a new theoretical mechanism to account for a portion of the motherhood penalty in wages and related labor market outcomes. At least a portion of this penalty is attributable to discrimination based on the assumption that mothers are less competent and committed than other types of workers. But what happens when mothers definitively prove their competence and commitment? In this study, we examine whether mothers face discrimination in labor-market-type evaluations even when they provide indisputable evidence that they are competent and committed to paid work. We test the hypothesis that evaluators discriminate against highly successful mothers by viewing them as less warm, less likable, and more interpersonally hostile than otherwise similar workers who are not mothers. The results support this ``normative discrimination'' hypothesis for female but not male evaluators. The findings have important implications for understanding the nature and persistence of discrimination toward mothers.	2	Stephen Benard; Shelley J. Correll
Lee, Kristen. 2010. 'Gender, Care Work, and the Complexity of Family Membership in Japan.' Gender \& Society. 24:5 647-671.	Gender \& Society	2010	2	This research investigates sociological ambivalence in negotiating care work in Japanese families. Women and their aging parents experience ambivalence based on conflicting norms of filial obligation, gender ideology, and cultural beliefs about the parent-child bond. Analysis of in-depth interview data showed ambivalence was based on (1) conflict between norms and cultural beliefs and (2) intergenerational differences in norms of caregiving. Not only are norms of care work in Japan gendered, but they also create conflicting demands for women who are torn among providing care for their parents, providing care for their in-laws, and changing expectations for women in contemporary Japan. In the families studied, norms of filial obligation were challenged, but gendered definitions of care work were left largely intact. These findings challenge theories of elder care that identify a hierarchy of preferred caregivers based on filial obligation and gender.	1	Kristen Schultz Lee

Gender \& Society. 24:5 672-696.	Gender \& Society	2010	3	Despite the 1970s middle-class feminist dream that women could have it all-families characterized by equitable distributions of household labor and interesting careers-the decades since have told a different story. In the U.S. context of a neoliberal labor market and privatized systems of family care, mothers still struggle to negotiate the conflicting demands of family and employment, particularly when caring for children with disabilities. Though an extensive literature examines labor market participation for mothers of children with disabilities, few scholars have examined the emotional impact of their altered career plans. Drawing from a sample of 40 single-and two-parent families, the author examines mothers' accounts of care for children with disabilities, focusing on their emotional experiences of their changed employment trajectories.	1	Ellen K.

I also discuss the obstacles encountered in my brief foray into researching two very different spheres of social life: gardening labor and an elite garden.	1	Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	6	This article describes the official protocol and unexpected contingencies that motored data collection for a large scale study of transgender inmates in California prisons for men. The focus is on gender and sexuality as methodological confounds that, surprisingly and productively, ultimately served to shed insight into basic sociological questions as well address the policy questions that originally motivated the research. Drawing on serendipitously collected ethnographic data from a plethora of exchanges with experts, California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) officials, researchers, and transgender inmates, this article reveals the categorization commitments and processes that permeate the lives of ``the girls among men'' in prisons for men. In light of these findings, the author argues for the value of adopting what she calls a ``soft mixed methods'' approach when doing non-ethnographic work designed to inform policy. To do so stimulates sociological imagination and ultimately provides more nuanced, layered, and complicated answers to policy questions while also providing insights into more basic research questions.	1	Valerie Jenness

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	5	This article discusses ethical issues confronted in The Stranger Next Door, my ethnographic study of a small town divided by a local ballot initiative against gay/lesbian civil rights. Seeking to intervene in public debates about the issue, I wrote a book that was broadly accessible, painting vivid portraits of local activists engaged in this conflict. When the pseudonymous community was ``outed'' by a review in the statewide newspaper, rightwing activists became incensed, and charged me with compromising their anonymity, among other offenses. Years later, as I reflect upon these accusations, I recognize that some of them have some credence. While public sociological work cannot and should not seek to avoid controversy, I question whether the quest for anonymity in ethnographic research always serves the interests of researchers and their subjects of study.	1	Arlene Stein

In particular, I discuss the research surprises, methodological lessons, and epistemological insights that I experienced during this research process. I also comment on the paradigms and concepts that have helped me decipher and reconcile the tensions of occupying a position as both a researcher trying to maintain standards of conventional academic rigor and a witness to reports of sexualized pain.	1	Gloria Gonzalez-Lopez

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	26	In this review, we summarize and critically evaluate the major empirical, conceptual, and theoretical directions that studies of aging families have taken during the first decade of the 21st century. The field has benefited from an expanded perspective based on four overarching themes: (a) complexity in emotional relations, (b) diversity in family structures and households, (c) interdependence of family roles and functions, and (d) patterns and outcomes of caregiving. Although research on aging families has advanced theory and applied innovative statistical techniques, the literature has fallen short in fully representing diverse populations and in applying the broadest set of methodological tools available. We discuss these and other frontier areas of scholarship in light of the aging of baby boomers and their families.	2	Merril Silverstein; Roseann Giarrusso

This article reviews new research on this topic, emphasizing how it can inform policy debates about the role of marriage in reducing poverty and improving child outcomes. It also pays special attention to new scholarship on unmarried, primarily low-income families, the target of recent federal marriage initiatives, to appraise the potential contributions of family research to ongoing policy discussions.	1	Susan L.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	7	One third of all children in the United States have a nonresident parent. On the basis of 13,085 children with a nonresident parent drawn from the 1997 National Survey of America's Families, this study examines nonresident mothers' and fathers' involvement (visitation and child support) with children who reside in different household types: single-parent families, married and cohabiting stepfamilies, and families headed by grandparents, other relatives, or nonrelatives. The relationship between children's living arrangements and nonresident parent involvement is complex and depends on both the gender of the nonresident parent and the type of involvement. Because nonresident parent involvement is low regardless of household type, policies and programs designed to increase involvement should include children in a variety of family forms.	1	Susan D.

But if such differences exist in single-parent families, the absence of a second parent rather than specific sex-typed parenting might explain them. We examine differences in mothering and fathering behavior in single-parent households, where number of parents is held constant, and we describe individualist and structuralist perspectives for potential sex-based parenting behaviors. We compare 3,202 single mothers and 307 single fathers in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (Kindergarten Cohort). Results suggest that, although there are small differences in the parenting behaviors of single mothers and single fathers, differences are sensitive to demographic disparities and do not translate to academic deficits for children in either family type.	5	Mikaela J.

Findings suggest that single-custodial-father families are distinct from single-mother and 2-biological-parent families in terms of sociodemographic characteristics, parenting styles, and involvement. Parenting styles and involvement mediate the differences between single-father families and 2-parent families in terms of high school completion and disconnectedness and partially mediate differences for single-custodial-father families with a partner. Family and sociodemographic characteristics are also associated with being disconnected for adolescents residing with a cohabiting custodial father.	3	Jacinta Bronte-Tinkew; Mindy E.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	4	Are economic resources related to relationship quality among young couples, and to what extent does this vary by relationship type? To answer these questions, we estimated regression models predicting respondent reports of conflict and affection in cohabiting and married partner relationships using the National Longitudinal Study of Youth, 1997 (NLSY97, N = 2,841) and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health, N = 1,702). We found that economic factors are an important predictor of conflict for both married and cohabiting couples. Affection was particularly responsive to human capital rather than short-term economic indicators. Economic hardship was associated with more conflict among married and cohabiting couples.	2	Jessica Halliday Hardie; Amy Lucas

First, did patterns of contraceptive use among cohabitors change during the last 2 decades of the 20th century? Second, did patterns of contraceptive use among cohabiting women tend to vary by education or race/ethnicity? Results point to a growing resemblance between never-married cohabiting women and those in first marriages in the likelihood of using a ``very effective'' contraceptive method and suggest that cohabitation is most ``marriage like'' with respect to reproductive behavior among the least educated.	1	Megan M.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	15	Although marital satisfaction starts high and declines for the average newlywed, some spouses may follow qualitatively distinct trajectories. Using 8 self-reports of satisfaction collected over 4 years from 464 newlywed spouses, we identified 5 trajectory groups, including patterns defined by high intercepts and no declines in satisfaction, moderate intercepts and minimal declines, and low intercepts and substantial declines. The groups varied systematically in their 4- and 10-year divorce rates, and wives tended to follow more satisfying trajectories than their husbands. Personality traits, stress, aggression, and communication behaviors assessed shortly after marriage discriminated among groups in expected directions. We conclude by outlining theoretical and practical implications of identifying distinct and predictable patterns of change in relationship satisfaction.	2	Justin A. Lavner; Thomas N. Bradbury

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	3	This study examined self-reported marital conflict behaviors and their implications for divorce. Husbands and wives (N = 373 couples; 47\% White American, 53\% Black American) reported conflict behaviors in Years 1, 3, 7, and 16 of their marriages. Individual behaviors (e. g., destructive behaviors) and patterns of behaviors between partners (e. g., withdrawal-constructive) in Year 1 predicted higher divorce rates. Wives' destructive and withdrawal behaviors decreased over time, whereas husbands' conflict behaviors remained stable. Husbands reported more constructive and less destructive behaviors than wives, and Black American couples reported more withdrawal than White American couples. Findings support behavioral theories of marriage demonstrating that conflict behaviors predict divorce and accommodation theories indicating that conflict behaviors become less negative over time.	4	Kira S.

Reczek, Corinne, Hui Liu & Debra Umberson. 2010. 'Just the Two of Us? How Parents Influence Adult Children's Marital Quality.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:5 1205-1219.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	1	We work from a life-course perspective to explore how relationships with parents affect adult children's marital quality. We further ask whether the effects of parents on adult children's marital quality depend on the adult child's gender, age, marital duration, and childhood family experiences. Growth-curve analysis of national, longitudinal data (Americans' Changing Lives) indicated that relationships with fathers (n = 336) and mothers (n = 520) differentially affected the marital quality of adult children over time. Findings suggest that the effects of the parent-adult child relationship on adult children's marriages depend on age, marital duration, and levels of family stress experienced in childhood.	3	Corinne Reczek; Hui Liu; Debra Umberson
Hoegnaes, Robin & Marcia Carlson. 2010. 'Intergenerational Relationships and Union Stability in Fragile Families.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:5 1220-1233.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	3	Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 2,656), we examined the association between intergenerational relationships and parents' union stability 5 years after a baby's birth. Results showed that more amiable relationships between parents and each partner's parents, and children's spending more time with paternal grandparents, increased the odds that parents coresided by the time their child was age 5. The more time that children spent with maternal grandparents reduced union stability, although this result was not robust to methods that better address selection. These findings underscore the importance of the broader social contexts affecting couple stability and suggest that even amid demographic changes, intergenerational family ties are important for couples and, by extension, their children.	2	Robin S.

Arranz, Oliver & Daniel Lois. 2010. 'Selection, Alignment, and Their Interplay: Origins of Lifestyle Homogamy in Couple Relationships.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:5 1234-1248.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	1	The present study examines different processes leading to lifestyle homogamy in married and cohabiting couples using data from the German Socioeconomic Panel (n = 3,490 couples). The analyses first suggest that alignment over time promotes homogamy of leisure-related lifestyles, especially with respect to action-oriented activities. However, intermediate stages in the life course (i.e., phases of active parenting and labor force participation) tend to inhibit alignment, whereas cues indicating a high-quality match (e. g., educational homogamy and being in a long-term or a marital relationship) promote alignment. Second, we find evidence for selection effects in that not only homogamy but also convergence of lifestyles over time may increase couples' resilience to relationship breakup.	2	Oliver Arranz; Daniel Lois

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	2	Although some sociologists have suggested that Japanese Americans quickly assimilated into mainstream America, scholars of Japanese America have highlighted the heightened exclusion that the group experienced. This study tracked historical shifts in the exclusion level of Japanese and Japanese Americans in the United States surrounding World War II with homogamy and intermarriage with Whites for the prewar (1930-1940) and resettlement (1946-1966) marriage cohorts. The authors applied log-linear models to census microsamples (N = 1,590,416) to estimate the odds ratios of homogamy versus intermarriage. The unadjusted odds ratios of Japanese Americans declined between cohorts and appeared to be consistent with the assimilation hypothesis. Once compositional influences and educational pairing patterns were adjusted, however, the odds ratios increased and supported the heightened exclusion hypothesis.	2	Hiromi Ono; Justin Berg

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	4	We investigate which partner of a 2-gender couple moves out after separation. We test hypotheses on the impact of differences between the partners in the costs of moving out and resources, using data from the Divorce in the Netherlands survey (N = 1,537 ex-couples who separated between 1972 and 1998). Ex-partners initiating the separation were more likely to leave, as were those for whom a new partnership was a reason for the separation. An ex-partner with custody of children was less likely to leave, as was an ex-partner with more resources. A woman was less likely to leave when the joint children no longer lived at home or when the partnership had been longer lasting.	2	Clara H. Mulder; Michael Wagner

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	1	The motherhood wage penalty is a substantial obstacle to progress in gender equality at work. Using matched employer-employee data from Norway (1979-1996, N = 236,857 individuals, N = 1,027,462 individual-years), a country with public policies that promote combining family and career, we investigate (a) whether the penalty arises from differential pay by employers or from the sorting of employees on occupations and establishments and (b) changes in the penalties during a period with major changes in family policies. We find that (a) the penalty to motherhood was mostly due to sorting on occupations and occupation-establishment units (mothers and nonmothers working in the same occupation and establishment received similar pay), and (b) the wage penalties to motherhood declined substantially over the 18-year period.	3	Trond Petersen; Andrew M.

Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:5 1289-1300.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	4	This article replicated and extended Harriet Presser's (2000) investigation of the linkages between nonstandard work and marital instability. We reexplored this question using data from a sample of 2,893 newlywed couples from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) and using different analytic techniques. In contrast to Presser, we found that the key dimension of husbands' and wives' employment was nonemployment. Similar to Presser, we found that wives' working of fixed night shifts increased the risk of divorce, driven by the experience in marriages over 5 years in duration. However, we did not replicate Presser's finding that the effect is significant only among households with children; rather, wives' fixed night shifts were associated with divorce only among those without children.	3	Ariel Kalil; Kathleen M.

Hosking, Amanda, Gillian Whitehouse & Janeen Baxter. 2010. 'Duration of Leave and Resident Fathers' Involvement in Infant Care in Australia.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:5 1301-1316.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	1	This article uses time-diary data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children (LSAC; N = 2,157 weekday diaries; N = 2,110 weekend diaries) to examine differences in infants' time with a resident father at age 4-19 months according to fathers' duration of leave around the birth. Results showed that those infants whose fathers took 4 weeks' leave or longer spent no more time with their father than did infants whose fathers took a shorter leave or no leave. We observed a positive association between any leave and sole father care on weekend days but not weekdays. The findings suggest that moderate increases in leave duration may not promote greater father involvement in Australia.	3	Amanda Hosking; Gillian Whitehouse; Janeen Baxter

Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:5 1317-1328.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	6	This study investigated whether the amount and nature of parent-child time mediated the association between parental work characteristics and parent-child relationship quality. We based hypotheses on the conflict and enrichment approaches, and we tested a path model using self-collected data on 1,008 Dutch fathers and 929 Dutch mothers with school-aged children. Longer working hours and less work engagement were associated with less parent-child time and longer working hours, more restrictive organizational norms, stress, flexibility, nonstandard hours (mothers only), and work engagement increased the disturbance of parent-child activities. Less and more disturbed parent-child activities were, in turn, associated with a lower parent-child relationship quality. In addition, work engagement and working hours had direct, beneficial effects on parent-child relationship quality.	3	Anne Roeters; Tanja Lippe; Esther S. Kluwer

Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:5 1329-1343.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	4	Cultural imperatives for ``good'' parenting include spending time with children and ensuring that they do well in life. Knowledge of how these factors influence employed parents' work-family balance is limited. Analyses using time diary and survey data from the 2000 National Survey of Parents (N = 933) indicate that how time with children relates to parents' feelings of balance varies by gender and social class. Interactive ``quality'' time is linked with mothers' feelings of balance more than fathers'. More time in routine care relates to imbalance for fathers without college degrees. Feeling that one spends the ``right'' amount of time with children and that children are doing well are strong and independent indicators of parents' work-family balance.	4	Melissa A.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	11	Research has associated parenthood with greater daily time commitments for fathers and mothers than for childless men and women, and with deeper gendered division of labor in households. How do these outcomes vary across countries with different average employment hours, family and social policies, and cultural attitudes to family care provision? Using nationally representative time-use data from the United States, Australia, Italy, France, and Denmark (N = 5,337), we compare the paid and unpaid work of childless partnered adults and parents of young children in each country. Couples were matched (except for the United States). We found parents have higher, less gender-equal workloads than nonparents in all five countries, but overall time commitments and the difference by parenthood status were most pronounced in the United States and Australia.	2	Lyn Craig; Killian Mullan

We used the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) data to test whether this finding applied to other countries as well (N = 100,307). We found that it did, but that the educational gap was greater in the United States than in the other 13 countries considered. Results from 2-level hierarchical linear models demonstrated that international differences in the educational gap were associated with several indicators of national policy and demographic contexts. No single policy appeared to have a large effect, but several policy combinations were associated with substantially reduced educational gaps between children from different family structures.	3	Patrick Heuveline; Hongxing Yang; Jeffrey M.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	4	If today there exists a single transcendent idea about the family-school connection, it is that a positive parent-child relationship improves children's chances of succeeding in school. However, using data from the Texas Higher Education Opportunity Project (N = 5,836), we demonstrate that, although positive parent-child relations are associated with better academic achievement in high school, they also are associated with an increased desire to live at home during college, which in turn decreases students' chances of enrolling in a 4-year college. Furthermore, we replicated some of these associations using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 10,120), demonstrating that positive family dynamics can influence educational outcomes in potentially divergent and unanticipated directions.	3	Ruth N.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	2	We analyzed determinants of women's employment with data for 40,792 women living in 103 districts of 6 Arab countries. We tested a new theoretical framework that addresses the roles of needs, opportunities, and values at multiple levels. At the microlevel (individual, family), socioeconomic factors, care duties, and traditionalism were important; at the macrolevel (district), economic development and societal norms were important. Women's education seemed most influential. Interaction analyses showed that returns on women's education depended on their partner's education and on the economic development, labor market structure, urbanization, and strength of traditional norms in the district in which women live. Our results stress the importance of a comprehensive approach toward women's employment in these countries.	3	Niels Spierings; Jeroen Smits; Mieke Verloo

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	2	In settings highly affected by HIV/AIDS, households headed by children may result from strained family relations, poverty, and stigma associated with the disease.

This study measured size and composition of the support and conflict networks of 27 children and youth heads of household in northern Namibia and documented their perceptions of adequacy. Results showed a strong presence of and satisfaction with kin and peers as supporters, which challenges the assumptions that these households have few functional ties to family and that adults are the sole providers of support. Assistance to children without parental supervision should build on existing local strategies and children's resources.	1	Monica Ruiz-Casares

Of the families, 174 were assigned to the prevention condition and 173 to a control condition. Emerging adults reported risk behaviors at pretest, posttest (7 months after pretest), and long-term follow-up (10 months after posttest). A significant Life stress x Prevention condition interaction emerged: Increases in risk behaviors were significantly greater among emerging adults in the control condition who experienced high stress levels than among those in the prevention condition who experienced equally high stress levels.	5	Gene H.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	6	This study compared men's and women's pathways to adulthood by examining how role transitions in education, work, marriage, and parenthood intersect and form developmental pathways from ages 18-30. The study investigated how sociodemographic factors and adolescent experiences were associated with these pathways. We used latent class analysis to analyze longitudinal data from a gender-balanced panel of 808 contemporary young adults. We found three similar latent pathways for both genders, but men and women differed in the timing of marriage and when they began to live with children and the likelihood of combining both roles. The present study points to the continued, though differential, relevance of marriage and family in the transition to adulthood for men and women.	4	Sabrina Oesterle; J. David Hawkins; Karl G.

Craig, Ailsa & Sebastien Dubois. 2010. 'Between Art and Money: the Social Space of Public Readings in Contemporary Poetry Economies and Careers.' Poetics. 38:5 441-460.	Poetics	2010	9	What roles do public poetry performances (i.e., `readings') play in contemporary fields of poetry production? Drawing from extensive ethnographic, survey, and interview data gathered in Paris, New York, and Toronto, we explore the social dynamics of readings in order to understand better how these public and social gatherings contribute to pony economies and careers. While differences exist between the locations for our research, the similarities are striking: we find that readings are crucial to poetry economies because they foster and maintain distribution networks for contemporary poetry in a global marketplace that tends to `squeeze out' forms of art that lack broad commercial appeal. We also find, across these locations, that readings are used in different ways by poets at different stages of career (i.e., unestablished, established, and well-established) and by poets operating in different genres (i.e., those writing `for the stage' versus those writing `for the page'). Finally, we emphasize that readings provide an important space in which poets and others (e.g., booksellers, publishers) navigate the difficulties of making art while dealing with the necessities of money.	2	Ailsa Craig; Sebastien Dubois

Poetics	2010	5	This article contributes to existing research on the use of genre classifications in the music industry by shedding light on it from the perspective of a relatively small European country. It investigates how recording companies, in the Netherlands, classify domestic music products. It examines differences and similarities in the genre-specification of `local' products compared to the practices in the international music industry, and it analyses hierarchies both within local genre classifications and between domestic and foreign music over time. Besides relying on interviews with key individuals in the Dutch music industry, we draw on Dutch chart data, music databases and trade information that address developments in the Dutch music market between 1990 and 2005. During that period, local Dutch music has not only become increasingly popular but has, to some extent, replaced Anglo-American music. Successful Dutch acts such as those operating in the genres `yolks' and dance are primarily promoted by independent firms, while majors and independents primarily approach the `local' in terms of market factors (e.g., demand), thereby foregoing the usual classifications of international genres.	2	Erik Hitters; Miriam Kamp

Poetics	2010	0	Multicultural content has become increasingly widespread in the core curriculum at colleges and universities in the United States. This article examines whether multicultural requirements are more prevalent at minority-serving colleges (i.e., tribal and historically black colleges) than at ``mainstream'' institutions without a minority-serving charter. It examines the prevalence of two kinds of multicultural content: pluralistic content that canvasses multiple minority groups or cultures, and particularistic perspectives that focus on only one group (in thiS case, African `Americans or American Indians). Multivariate analyses indicate that tribal, black, and mainstream colleges do not differ with respect to pluralistic requirements in the core curriculum, but that particularistic requirements are more extensive at black colleges and especially at tribal colleges.	1	Wade M.

Poetics	2010	3	By focusing on the interpretative aspect of mobilization, the framing perspective has provided significant insights to the social movements literature. Despite the growing number of studies focused on collective action frames, and master frames, the choice of how to investigate frame dynamics remains controversial. This paper explores the question of how researchers could empirically depict and measure framing tasks and frame components by focusing on the linguistic properties of social movement texts. It looks at semantic grammars as a possible way to craft linguistically based coding schemes able to extract collective action frames, as organic systems of meaning, from social movement discourses. It is shown how a ``frame semantic grammar'' could provide a reliable method of investigation to go from texts to frames, across case studies and research questions.	1	Stefania Vicari

Second, by simultaneously including variables of structural and individual nature. Finally, by making progress with respect to the interactions between educational homogamy and other important variables associated with high levels of social inequality in the region: race, ethnicity and birthplace.	2	Albert Esteve; Luis Lopez-Ruiz

Population Research and Policy Review	2010	0	Using the 2000 wave of Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS3), this study attempts to further complement studies that seek to analyze the relationship between migration and prenatal care utilization in Indonesia. The major conclusion from the multilevel logistic regression suggests that migrants are less likely than non-migrants to seek prenatal care in a public or private hospital but are more likely than non-migrants to initiate prenatal care in their first trimester and to receive four or more prenatal visits. Several measures of child, woman, household and community characteristics are also significant predictors of the location, timing and frequency of prenatal care. It is evident that the design of effective and efficient policies requires a more comprehensive knowledge of the determinants of migration and maternal healthcare services utilization. The assessment of whether the extent of the location, timing and frequency of prenatal care differs between migrants and non-migrants would have important policy implications for both individuals and society at large.	1	Hui-Peng Liew
Garip, Filiz & Sara Curran. 2010. 'Increasing Migration, Diverging Communities: Changing Character of Migrant Streams in Rural Thailand.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:5 659-685.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	2	This paper studies how increasing migration changes the character of migrant streams in sending communities. Cumulative causation theory posits that past migration patterns determine future flows, as prior migrants provide resources, influence, or normative pressures that make individuals more likely to migrate. The theory implies exponentially increasing migration flows that are decreasingly selective. Recent research identifies heterogeneity in the cumulative patterns and selectivity of migration in communities. We propose that this heterogeneity may be explained by individuals' differential access to previously accumulated migration experience. Multi-level, longitudinal data from 22 rural Thai communities allow us to measure the distribution of past experience as a proxy for its accessibility to community members. We find that migration becomes a less-selective process as migration experience accumulates, and migrants become increasingly diverse in socio-demographic characteristics. Yet, selectivity within migrant streams persists if migration experience is not uniformly distributed among, and hence not equally accessible to, all community members. The results confirm that the accumulation and distribution of prior migrants' experiences distinctly shape future migration flows, and may lead to diverging cumulative patterns in communities over time.	2	Filiz Garip; Sara Curran
Fu, Vincent. 2010. 'Remarriage, Delayed Marriage, and Black/white Intermarriage, 1968-1995.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:5 687-713.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	3	How have changes in marriage order and marriage timing affected 1968-1995 trends in United States Black/White intermarriage? Researchers usually follow a one-sex perspective on the effects of timing and marriage order on marital selection, arguing that delayed marriages and remarriages will be more heterogamous than early or first marriages. This paper shows that a one-sex perspective is oversimplified and that assortative marriage with respect to race depends on the interaction of both husband's and wife's characteristics. Marriages that match with respect to age or marriage order tend to also match with respect to race. First marriages and remarriages for both partners are more likely to be same-race marriages. Marriages that are intermarriages with respect to marriage order are more likely to also be intermarriages with respect to race. Marriages that are usual age combinations (husband and wife similar in age or husband slightly older) are also usual race combinations (husband and wife same race). Marriages that are unusual age combinations are more likely to be racial intermarriages. This paper also shows that trends in remarriage patterns do not account for the increasing trend in racial intermarriage and that trends in marriage timing have actually slowed increases in racial intermarriage.	1	Vincent Kang Fu
Balistreri, Kelly. 2010. 'Welfare and the Children of Immigrants: Transmission of Dependence or Investment in the Future?.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:5 715-743.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	0	The public concern that immigrant families might be using a disproportionate share of social benefits and transmitting some form of public dependency to their children, combined with the rising levels of immigrants entering the country, fueled the passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act in 1996, which limited public assistance to many immigrant families. This paper uses the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to explore the association between exposure to welfare and young adult outcomes of high school graduation, college enrollment and labor force participation with a focus on parental nativity status as well as broad country of origin group. Results indicate a persistent negative association between welfare legacy and high school graduation; a negative association that is most pronounced for children of natives. Results also show the largest positive effect of welfare receipt among the most disadvantaged group, the young adult children of immigrants from Mexican and Central American countries. The main finding of this study suggests that the negative impacts of welfare receipt might be lessened and in some cases reversed among the young adults from immigrant families. Such findings challenge the common notion that immigrant families use welfare as a crutch across generations and raise serious concern about U.S. immigration and welfare policies.	1	Kelly Stamper Balistreri
Zhai, Fuhua & Qin Gao. 2010. 'Center-based Care in the Context of One-child Policy in China: Do Child Gender and Siblings Matter?.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:5 745-774.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	0	We examined the effects of child gender and siblings on center-based care enrollment in the context of China's one-child policy and its tradition of preference to have many children, especially sons. Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) 2000 wave and multilevel logistic regression models, we found that children without siblings consistently had higher odds of receiving center-based care than those with siblings, while there was no evidence that child gender mattered. Further analyses did not show evidence that the effects of child gender and siblings were moderated by household and community resources or local one-child policy. However, we did find that the presence of male, older, or school-age siblings (as compared to female, younger, or preschool-age siblings) reduced preschoolers' odds of receiving center-based care. This was possibly because parents valued formal education much more than preschools and thus focused more on boys when they entered elementary schools than on their sisters or younger brothers. These findings suggest that more attention needs to be given to the equal education opportunities for boys and girls as well as for children with and without siblings.	2	Fuhua Zhai; Qin Gao
Miguel, Veronica & Mark Tranmer. 2010. 'Personal Support Networks of Immigrants to Spain: a Multilevel Analysis.' Social Networks. 32:4 253-262.	Social Networks	2010	2	Immigrant flows to Spain have increased greatly in the last decade, but little is known about the composition and role of their personal support networks. Our research questions are: (1) Which factors are associated with ties between immigrants and `Spaniards' (the more settled resident Spanish population), compared with immigrants and non-Spaniards (other immigrants)? (2) Do the support roles of Spaniards and non-Spaniards differ? We analyse personal network (ego-net) survey data. Multilevel logistic regression models are applied, in which the unit of analysis is the undirected tie between an immigrant (ego) and an alter and the dependent variable is whether this tie is to a Spaniard alter, as opposed to a non-Spaniard. We determine the characteristics that are most strongly associated with the probability of a tie between an immigrant and a Spaniard, compared with a non-Spaniard, and consider characteristics of the immigrants (ego), the alters, the relative characteristics of ego-alter, support roles, and local geographical factors. We find a tie to a Spaniard alter is more likely if the immigrant's country of birth is Portugal or Eastern Europe; if the alter is a work colleague or neighbour; if alter is older than ego. There is geographical variation in the probability of ties to Spaniards, partly explained by the local area presence of co-nationals from the same country of origin as the immigrant. A tie to a Spaniard alter is less likely for immigrants from North Africa (Maghreb); those with no previous contact with Spain; those who are not the first of their peer group/family to immigrate; if ego and alter both work in agriculture. Material help is more likely to be exchanged with a Spaniard alter. Non-Spaniard alters are more likely to exchange help with accommodation and information. `Finding a job' is equally associated with Spaniard and non-Spaniard alters. A tentative conclusion is that some combinations of these characteristics, where a tie to a Spaniard is less likely, may be associated with higher levels of prejudice. Conversely, those characteristics that are positively associated with a tie to a Spaniard may indicate situations where integration of the immigrant population with Spaniards is successfully taking place, and where prejudices are lower, or non-existent. These findings may therefore be helpful for targeting resources to reduce such prejudices. The different types of support exchanged between immigrants and Spaniards and immigrants and non-Spaniards, may indicate current shortfalls in this process, as well as indicating where this support is successfully being exchanged.	2	Veronica Miguel; Mark Tranmer
Bhattacharyya, Siddhartha & Stellan Ohlsson. 2010. 'Social Creativity as a Function of Agent Cognition and Network Properties: a Computer Model.' Social Networks. 32:4 263-278.	Social Networks	2010	3	Inventions - concepts, devices, procedures - are often created by networks of interacting agents in which the agents can be individuals (as in a scientific discipline) or they can themselves be collectives (as in firms interacting in a market). Different collectives create and invent at different rates. It is plausible that the rate of invention is jointly determined by properties of the agents (e.g., their cognitive capacity) and by properties of the network of interactions (e.g., the density of the communication links), but little is known about such two-level interactions. We present an agent-based model of social creativity in which the individual agent captures key features of the human cognitive architecture derived from cognitive psychology, and the interactions are modeled by agents exchanging partial results of their symbolic processing of task information. We investigated the effect of agent and network properties on rates of invention and diffusion in the network via systematic parameter variations. Simulation runs show, among other results, that (a) the simulation exhibits network effects, i.e., the model captures the beneficial effect of collaboration; (b) the density of connections produces diminishing returns in term of the benefits on the invention rate: and (c) limits on the cognitive capacity of the individual agents have the counterintuitive consequence of focusing their efforts. Limitations and relations to other computer simulation models of creative collectives are discussed.	2	Siddhartha Bhattacharyya; Stellan Ohlsson
Lindgren, Karl-Oskar. 2010. 'Dyadic Regression in the Presence of Heteroscedasticity-an Assessment of Alternative Approaches.' Social Networks. 32:4 279-289.	Social Networks	2010	3	Although the problem of heteroscedasticity has been the subject of much discussion in other areas of applied statistics the problem has received scant attention in the social network literature. This study attempts to remedy this situation by considering how traditional methods for significance testing in dyadic regression models, such as standard QAP tests, perform under conditions of heteroscedasticity. Moreover, the article presents two alternative methods to deal with heteroscedasticity that are both shown to perform rather well with typical social network data under conditions of both heteroscedasticity and homoscedasticity. Overall, the results of the study suggest that applied researchers using regression techniques to study dyadic data are well advised to correct for heteroscedasticity, by either of the two methods discussed here, whenever there is a reason to suspect heteroscedasticity.	1	Karl-Oskar Lindgren
Neuman, Eric & Mark Mizruchi. 2010. 'Structure and Bias in the Network Autocorrelation Model.' Social Networks. 32:4 290-300.	Social Networks	2010	3	In a recent paper (Mizruchi and Neuman, 2008), we showed that estimates of rho in the network autocorrelation model exhibited a systematic negative bias and that the magnitude of this bias increased monotonically with increases in network density. We showed that this bias held regardless of the size of the network, the number of exogenous variables in the model, and whether the matrix W was normalized or in raw form. The networks in our simulations were random, however, which raises the question of the extent to which the negative bias holds in various structured networks. In this paper, we reproduce the simulations from our earlier paper on a series of networks drawn to represent well-known structures, including star, caveman, and small-world structures. Results from these simulations indicate that the pattern of negative bias in rho continues to hold in all of these structures and that the negative bias continues to increase at increasing levels of density. Interestingly, the negative bias in rho is especially pronounced at extremely low-density levels in the star network. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings.	2	Eric J.

Buskens, Vincent, Werner Raub & Joris Veer. 2010. 'Trust in Triads: an Experimental Study.' Social Networks. 32:4 301-312.	Social Networks	2010	5	Pairs of trustors play finitely repeated Trust Games with the same trustee in a laboratory experiment. We study trustfulness of the trustor and trustworthiness of the trustee. We distinguish between learning and control effects on behavior. Learning effects are related to the trustor's information on past behavior of the trustee. Control effects are related to the trustor's opportunities for sanctioning a trustee in future interactions. Hypotheses on learning and control effects are derived from backward-looking learning models and from forward-looking models of strategic behavior. The design of the experiment, with respect to trustfulness, allows for disentangling learning effects from a trustor's own experience with the trustee and learning effects through third-party information. Also, the design enables disentangling control effects on trustworthiness and trustfulness through a trustor's own sanction opportunities and opportunities for third-party sanctions. We find evidence for learning and control effects. The trustor's own experiences, the experiences of the other trustor, as well as the trustor's own sanction opportunities affect trustfulness. We find evidence for control effects on trustworthiness, including effects arising from opportunities for third-party sanctions. However, there is no evidence for control effects through opportunities for third-party sanctions on trustfulness. This could indicate limited strategic rationality of trustors.	3	Vincent Buskens; Werner Raub; Joris Veer
Szell, Michael & Stefan Thurner. 2010. 'Measuring Social Dynamics in a Massive Multiplayer Online Game.' Social Networks. 32:4 313-329.	Social Networks	2010	19	Quantification of human group-behavior has so far defied an empirical, falsifiable approach. This is due to tremendous difficulties in data acquisition of social systems. Massive multiplayer online games (MMOG) provide a fascinating new way of observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously socially interacting individuals engaged in virtual economic activities. We have compiled a data set consisting of practically all actions of all players over a period of 3 years from a MMOG played by 300,000 people. This large-scale data set of a socio-economic unit contains all social and economic data from a single and coherent source. Players have to generate a virtual income through economic activities to `survive' and are typically engaged in a multitude of social activities offered within the game. Our analysis of high-frequency log files focuses on three types of social networks, and tests a series of social-dynamics hypotheses. In particular we study the structure and dynamics of friend-, enemy- and communication networks. We find striking differences in topological structure between positive (friend) and negative (enemy) tie networks. All networks confirm the recently observed phenomenon of network densification. We propose two approximate social laws in communication networks, the first expressing betweenness centrality as the inverse square of the overlap, the second relating communication strength to the cube of the overlap. These empirical laws provide strong quantitative evidence for the Weak ties hypothesis of Granovetter. Further, the analysis of triad significance profiles validates well-established assertions from social balance theory. We find overrepresentation (underrepresentation) of complete (incomplete) triads in networks of positive ties, and vice versa for networks of negative ties. Empirical transition probabilities between triad classes provide evidence for triadic closure with extraordinarily high precision. For the first time we provide empirical results for large-scale networks of negative social ties. Whenever possible we compare our findings with data from non-virtual human groups and provide further evidence that online game communities serve as a valid model for a wide class of human societies. With this setup we demonstrate the feasibility for establishing a `socio-economic laboratory' which allows to operate at levels of precision approaching those of the natural sciences. All data used in this study is fully anonymized: the authors have the written consent to publish from the legal department of the Medical University of Vienna.	2	Michael Szell; Stefan Thurner

Social Networks	2010	1	The gendered meaning of the repartnering process and the social capital mechanisms that facilitate it were examined by means of in-depth interviews with 32 Israelis 60 years and older. Two central themes emerged from the interviews. The first theme relates to the interviewees' gendered perceptions of the change in their social capital between partnering relationships. The second theme concerns respondents' recognition of the new partnership as social capital. These themes reflect the gendered dynamics in the use of social capital for repartnering in old age. The study also illustrates the complexity of `social capital' as a concept and addresses its relevance for the elders' well being.	1	Tal Spalter
Everett, Martin & Stephen Borgatti. 2010. 'Induced, Endogenous and Exogenous Centrality.' Social Networks. 32:4 339-344.	Social Networks	2010	6	Centrality measures are based upon the structural position an actor has within the network. Induced centrality, sometimes called vitality measures, take graph invariants as an overall measure and derive vertex level measures by deleting individual nodes or edges and examining the overall change. By taking the sum of standard centrality measures as the graph invariant we can obtain measures which examine how much centrality an individual node contributes to the centrality of the other nodes in the network, we call this exogenous centrality. We look at exogenous measures of degree, closeness and betweenness.	2	Martin G. Everett; Stephen P. Borgatti

Social Networks	2010	13	Though commonly used in social science research to measure the influence of social networks, the link between discussing ``important matters'' within networks and the achievement of instrumental ends is frequently unspecified or untested. To address this gap, we explore the consequences of using the general ``important matters'' approach versus one in which the substance of discussions is directly linked to the outcomes of interest. The egocentric social networks of people experiencing an acute health crisis are examined. We identify the characteristics of and the degree of membership overlap between ``important matters'' and ``health matters'' discussants, and explore their relative power in explaining a wide range of health and health services-related outcomes. We find no evidence for the influence of ``important matters'' networks, while characteristics of ``health matters'' networks demonstrate a significant effect across all models.	2	Brea L.

Sohoni, Deenesh & Misha Petrovic. 2010. 'Teaching a Global Sociology: Suggestions for Globalizing the U.s. Curriculum.' Teaching Sociology. 38:4 287-300.	Teaching Sociology	2010	0	Increasingly, educators have called on colleges and universities to prepare their students for a more interdependent world. While sociology has begun to heed the message to globalize the curriculum, efforts to implement relevant teaching practices are hampered by lack of consensus on what `'internationalizing'' or `'globalizing'' the classroom actually means and the most effective ways to accomplish this goal. The purpose of this article is twofold: first, to identify the multiple meanings of internationalizing or globalizing the classroom, and second, to suggest teaching strategies relevant to the specific pedagogical goals of teaching a more globalized version of the discipline. Three sociology courses-Race and Ethnic Relations, Classical Social Theory, and Migration in a Global Context-are used to illustrate how a more systematic understanding of globalizing the curriculum can improve course design.	2	Deenesh Sohoni; Misha Petrovic

'Teaching Urban Sociology and Urban Sustainability on Two Feet, Two Wheels, and in Three Cities: Our Experience Teaching Sustainable Cities in North America.' Teaching Sociology. 38:4 301-313.	Teaching Sociology	2010	1	The authors describe their experiences teaching Sustainable Cities in North America, a course on both urban sociology and urban sustainability. This course brought students to Portland, Oregon, and Vancouver, British Columbia, and then compared those cities with Minneapolis, Minnesota, on various dimensions of urban sustainability. After connecting this course to existing sociological scholarship on teaching urban sociology and travel-study abroad, the authors describe their course `'in action'': what they did, why it was (and was not) `'green,'' and an assessment of the course, including postcourse actions and institutional changes that the course inspired. The authors conclude with a call for more `'green'' sociology courses and travel-study abroad courses as innovative and exciting ways to teach sociology and to further the discipline's commitment to ethical environmental actions.	2	Lars Christiansen; Nancy Fischer
Spalter-Roth, Roberta, Mary Senter, Pamela Stone & Michael Wood. 2010. 'Asa's Bachelor's and Beyond Survey: Findings and Their Implications for Students and Departments.' Teaching Sociology. 38:4 314-329.	Teaching Sociology	2010	1	With the support of the National Science Foundation, the American Sociological Association conducted a longitudinal survey of sociology majors from the class of 2005, following them from senior year into careers or graduate school. The first part of this article provides a context for the results from the What Can I Do with a Bachelor's Degree in Sociology? study and a summary of its key findings. Wave I data demonstrate strong student interest in sociological concepts, perceived mastery of some research skills but not others, and general satisfaction with the major. Sociology majors are both idealists and careerists. The majority expects to enter the job market after graduation but is not satisfied with the career advising they receive. Key findings from Wave II demonstrate that more respondents go directly into the job market than expected, job search strategies are important in finding a job that matches what students learned in their sociology programs, and those who find such jobs are more satisfied with the major. The second part discusses how the survey findings can be used to enhance curriculum, advising, and assessment without vocationalizing the curriculum and without adding extra burdens to faculty members' already heavy schedules. Finally, the article discusses how the data can be used as a baseline for department assessment.	4	Roberta Spalter-Roth; Mary Scheuer Senter; Pamela Stone; Michael Wood
Persell, Caroline. 2010. 'How Sociological Leaders Rank Learning Goals for Introductory Sociology.' Teaching Sociology. 38:4 330-339.	Teaching Sociology	2010	3	In 2001, the American Sociological Association launched a task force to articulate learning goals for an introduction to sociology course and design an advanced high school sociology curriculum that could also be a model for introductory sociology courses in colleges and universities. This research note describes one of several efforts to validate the learning goals developed by that ASA task force, by asking a sample of peer-designated sociological leaders to complete an electronic survey ranking the importance of the 30 learning goals identified. The top 5 goals were to show the reality of structural factors in social life, place an issue in a larger context, identify and offer explanations for social inequality, recognize the difference between empirical and normative statements, and compare and contrast one's own context with those of people in other parts of the United States and the world.	1	Caroline Hodges Persell

The assignments are focused on fulfilling the particular course learning goal that highlights student mastery of the application of diverse theoretical perspectives in societal analysis. The article offers a brief overview of how theoretical thinking is introduced in the classroom and continues with a discussion of particular assignments used to promote student engagement and understanding: the preparation of a letter to a theorist, the creation of a poster to visually represent the life and ideas of a theorist, and the writing and performance of a play `'starring'' theorists studied in class. The article concludes with a discussion of the issues of assessment and student learning and a consideration of how these assignments may benefit student learners both within and outside of sociology.	1	Daina S.

Teaching Sociology	2010	1	In this paper, I discuss the possibilities that emerge from using literary fiction as a tool for teaching social theory and critical consciousness. Focusing on data from a social theory course I taught in fall 2007, along with my experiences teaching social theory, I evaluate the utility of utilizing literary fiction in the social theory classroom. Serving as a mechanism to encourage the development of critical consciousness, literary fiction can expand classroom dynamics and establish engaged dialogue between students and teachers. In particular, it has the potential to make social theory interesting and meaningful to students who are often anxious about learning social theory.	1	Christina D. Weber

The authors uses anecdotal evidence to describe the exercise in which students pair with someone of the opposite gender and paint each other's fingernails. Additionally, the author uses a randomly selected sample of 19 students to formally evaluate the teaching goals of this assignment. Students regard the nail polish assignment favorably, with average scores ranging from 3.37 to 4.26 (out of 5). The evaluation and anecdotal evidence confirms a continuing need to address homophobia in everyday life and in the classroom. This activity offers an innovative approach to doing so.	1	Nelta M.

American Journal of Sociology	2010	20	Conventional wisdom suggests that when institutional logics overlap, the production of hybrids signifies collapse, blending, or easy coexistence. The author provides an alternative interpretation: hybrids can maintain a distinctive boundary and can emerge from contestation, not coexistence. This alternative interpretation is grounded in an analysis of a critical moment at the academic-commercial boundary: the enforcement of patents to a key technology on academic geneticists. In their reaction to commercial encroachment, skilled actors (scientists) took the resources of the commercial logic and transformed their meaning to establish hybrid strategies that preserved the distinctive institutions. Thus, hybrids must be reconsidered as emerging from conflict and produced through boundary work to maintain the distinction and resilience of logics.	1	Fiona Murray

American Journal of Sociology	2010	2	How does collaboration between academic research and industry shape science? This article argues that companies' relative indifference to theory nudges their academic partners toward novel, theoretically unanticipated experiments. The article then evaluates this proposition using fieldwork, archival materials, and panel models of all academic research using the popular plant model Arabidopsis thaliana and the companies that support that research. Findings suggest that industry partnerships draw high-status academics away from confirming theories and toward speculation. For the network of scientific ideas surrounding Arabidopsis, industry sponsorship weaves discoveries around the periphery into looser, more expansive knowledge. Government funding plays a complementary role, sponsoring focused scientific activity in dense hubs that facilitate scientific community and understanding.	1	James A. Evans

American Journal of Sociology	2010	2	Using a data set of public and private relief spending for 295 cities, this article examines the racial and ethnic patterning of social welfare provision in the United States in 1929. On the eve of the Depression, cities with more blacks or Mexicans spent the least on social assistance and relied more heavily on private money to fund their programs. Cities with more European immigrants spent the most on relief and relied more heavily on public funding. Distinct political systems, labor market relations, and racial ideologies about each group's proclivity to use relief best explain relief spending differences across cities.	1	Cybelle Fox

The authors replicate Sampson's multilevel version of Kasarda and Janowitz's systemic model of community using data from a survey of nearly 10,000 people residing in 99 small Iowa communities. They improve on Sampson's work by using multilevel statistical tools, better measurement of community attachment, and data from 99 actual communities. While the authors find general support for the systemic model, their results suggest that the community one lives in actually has little effect on one's level of community attachment, calling into question many of the basic assumptions and findings of past community research.	2	Jeremy Flaherty; Ralph B.

American Journal of Sociology. 116:2 543-582.	American Journal of Sociology	2010	9	Conceptions of adulthood have changed dramatically in recent decades. Despite such changes, however, the notion that young people will eventually ``settle down'' and desist from delinquent behaviors is remarkably persistent. This article unites criminology with classic work on age norms and role behavior to contend that people who persist in delinquency will be less likely to make timely adult transitions. The empirical analysis supports this proposition, with both arrest and self-reported crime blocking the passage to adult status. The authors conclude that desisting from delinquency is an important part of the package of role behaviors that define adulthood.	2	Michael Massoglia; Christopher Uggen

American Journal of Sociology	2010	24	A notable feature of U. S. social networks is their high degree of racial homogeneity, which is often attributed to racial homophily-the preference for associating with individuals of the same racial background. The authors unpack racial homogeneity using a theoretical framework that distinguishes between various tie formation mechanisms and their effects on the racial composition of networks, exponential random graph modeling that can disentangle these mechanisms empirically, and a rich new data set based on the Facebook pages of a cohort of college students. They first show that racial homogeneity results not only from racial homophily proper but also from homophily among coethnics of the same racial background and from balancing mechanisms such as the tendency to reciprocate friendships or to befriend the friends of friends, which both amplify the homogeneity effects of homophily. Then, they put the importance of racial homophily further into perspective by comparing its effects to those of other mechanisms of tie formation. Balancing, propinquity based on coresidence, and homophily regarding nonracial categories (e. g., students from ``elite'' backgrounds or those from particular states) all influence the tie formation process more than does racial homophily.	2	Andreas Wimmer; Kevin Lewis
Freeman, Lance. 2010. 'African American Locational Attainment Before the Civil Rights Era.' City \& Community. 9:3 235-255.	City \& Community	2010	0	The conventional wisdom is that due to intense discrimination, prior to the Civil Rights era blacks of all classes lived side by side. Individual socioeconomic status did not translate into improved locational outcomes according to this view. But several historical case studies suggest that upper-stratum blacks did indeed live in neighborhoods set apart from their poorer brethren. This study uses individual-level data from the 1910-1950 Public Use Microdata Samples to investigate how individual-level socioeconomic status translated into neighborhood-level outcomes for blacks. The study finds that among blacks, individual-level socioeconomic status played no role in determining residential proximity to whites. For blacks individual socioeconomic status was, however, an important determinant of other neighborhood outcomes.	1	Lance Freeman
vonLockette, Niki. 2010. 'the Impact of Metropolitan Residential Segregation on the Employment Chances of Blacks and Whites in the United States.' City \& Community. 9:3 256-273.	City \& Community	2010	1	Studies of residential segregation's role in creating employment inequality between blacks and whites have focused on the characteristics of neighborhoods (e. g., mean SES or distance from job centers). In contrast, this study considers the broader structure of metropolitan segregation in which neighborhoods are situated and its impact on the racial disparity in access to employment opportunities. The study employs multilevel analyses and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to test the effects of metropolitan segregation in 1980 on respondents' probability of being employed by 1990 net of individual and family level characteristics, and to assess the role of segregation in explaining the race gap in employment between blacks and whites. The analyses reveal that residential segregation decreases employment odds for blacks, but not for whites, and explains the residual race gap in the probability of being employed. In addition, the depressive effect of segregation on employment is weaker for black women than it is for black men.	1	Niki Dickerson vonLockette
Oropesa, R. & Leif Jensen. 2010. 'Dominican Immigrants and Discrimination in a New Destination: the Case of Reading, Pennsylvania.' City \& Community. 9:3 274-298.	City \& Community	2010	4	The last decade has witnessed the diversification of immigrant destinations in the United States. Although the literature on this phenomenon is burgeoning, research on the experiences of smaller immigrant groups in new destinations is underdeveloped. This is especially the case for those from the Dominican Republic, a group that is expanding beyond the traditional gateway cities of the Northeast. Using a survey of Dominican immigrants in Reading, Pennsylvania, this study has two objectives. The first objective is to describe the prevalence of experiences with institutional and interpersonal discrimination. The second objective is to determine the extent to which these experiences are structured around racial markers (i.e., skin tone), forms of capital, forms of incorporation, and exposure to the United States. Our results show that a substantial minority of Dominican immigrants claims to have been treated unfairly, primarily because of their ``race and ethnicity.'' In addition, experiences with some types of discrimination are positively associated with skin tone (i.e., darkness) and several factors that are identified in models of assimilation.	2	R. S.

Marsh, Kris & John Iceland. 2010. 'the Racial Residential Segregation of Black Single Living Alone Households.' City \& Community. 9:3 299-319.	City \& Community	2010	0	While many studies have examined the intersection of race and class with residential segregation and residential preferences, little is known about the role played by household composition in shaping residential patterns. This article focuses on the residential patterns of a particular kind of household: those consisting of persons single and living alone (SALA). We compare the residential segregation of black SALA households-an important subset of nonfamily households and a rapidly growing segment of the population-from white SALA households and from both white and black married-couple households. We examine how group and metropolitan characteristics influence segregation levels for these household types. Using data from the 2000 census, we find that black SALA households are less segregated from white SALA households than from white married-couple households. Multivariate analyses show that smaller income differences across SALA households account for these segregation patterns, indicating the importance of economic resources in influencing residential patterns. Nevertheless, race continues to play an important role, as black SALA household segregation from both kinds of white households is high in absolute terms and in relation to their segregation from black married-couple households.	2	Kris Marsh; John Iceland
Ovadia, Seth & Laura Moore. 2010. 'Decomposing the Moral Community: Religious Contexts and Teen Childbearing.' City \& Community. 9:3 320-334.	City \& Community	2010	1	Teen birth rates vary widely across counties in the United States. In this study, we examine whether the religious composition of a county is correlated with the rate of teen childbearing using both a traditional moral communities approach and a ``decomposed'' version of that framework. Utilizing 2000 data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United States Census Bureau, and the Religious Congregation and Membership Survey, we find that the total percentage of religious adherents in a county is not significantly correlated with the teen birth rate. However, when we decompose the Christian population into major denominational groupings, we find the percentage of evangelical Protestants in a county is positively associated with the teen birth rate while the percentage of Catholics is negatively associated with teen childbearing. Possible explanations for the association between religious context and teen birth rates are discussed, as well as their policy and research implications.	2	Seth Ovadia; Laura M. Moore

Ethnography	2010	4	Drawing on evidence from Anshan City, Liaoning Province, the People's Republic of China, we argue that the recent commodification and proliferation of idyllicized representations of rurality, a trend that runs directly counter to the symbolic infrastructure of China's mass urbanization and industrialization, indicates a paradigm shift in Chinese consumer perceptions. We explore a theory of the `Romantic reappraisal of Chinese consumer values', drawing upon the reappraisal of values ascribed to the `Romantic period' which followed the industrial revolution in Britain and Western Europe in the late 18th century. Similarities and differences with this earlier shift are explored. One of the authors has spent several lengthy periods of ethnographic investigation in Anshan since 2005, drawing on networks from a wide range of social spheres.	3	Michael B.

Kirke, Charles. 2010. 'Orders Is Orders ... Aren't They? Rule Bending and Rule Breaking in the British Army.' Ethnography. 11:3 359-380.	Ethnography	2010	1	In common with all professional armies, the British Army is a disciplined force. There is a sharply stratified rank structure and formal rules abound. There is a prima facie case therefore that when formal rules are broken or bent the individuals involved are taking part in acts of `resistance' or `misbehaviour' or `dissent', implying a binary opposition of interests between junior and senior. However, in this article I seek to provide a more nuanced approach to identify a range of rule bending and rule breaking processes embedded in the organizational culture at unit level, through a small number of case studies. To assist in the process, Goffman's model of `underlife' is adopted and extended for the British Army case, but only as a framework to assist in locating the observed events in the rich cultural milieu in which they take place. Viewed in this way, rule bending/breaking activities can be seen as complex and intricate events involving both those who break or bend the formal rules and the agents of authority in a continuing social process, part of the weft and warp of everyday life at regimental duty.	1	Charles Kirke

Ethnography	2010	1	This article compares indigenous conceptualizations, as expressed in ledgers recording the collection of funeral offerings, with academic knowledge on kinship and value negotiation in the Akan area of West Africa. Donors are inserted in social circuits defining their residential belonging (in villages and households), parental affiliation (with specific offerings for matrilineal kin, patrilateral kin and in-laws), as well as gender and seniority. Funeral offerings, moreover, vary proportionally to value: the amount provided by the donor expresses his/her value and the total cost of the funeral indicates the value of the deceased and of her/his family. The intricacies of mortuary offerings - expressed through elaborate calculations - reveal shared and structured taxonomies that enable affirming and negotiating the value of the deceased and that of the donor as well as the relation between donor and deceased. Anthropological theories and definitions are confronted with these locally elaborated representations.	1	Stefano Boni
Jamieson, Mark. 2010. 'a Journey Into Symbolic Disorder: Miskitu Reactions to Mestizo Catholic Ritual in Nicaragua.' Ethnography. 11:3 409-424.	Ethnography	2010	0	This article considers a Catholic Miskitu catechist's view of Managua's festival of Santo Domingo, an event that should be understood as a `rite of reversal' emphasizing ritual humiliation of the saint, symbolic disorder and regeneration. It shows that the horror experienced by the catechist witnessing this series of rituals, then travelling with the anthropologist, had less to do with a lack of a relativist appreciation for the practices of others, as evidenced by his appreciation of the festival of the Virgin of Fatima in Bluefields, than it did with a very real fear of symbolic inversion and the possibility of divine punishment. The article argues that an understanding of this reaction should be sought in the history of a in Miskitu Catholicism very different to orthodox Nicaraguan Catholicism and in Miskitu notions of divinity.	1	Mark Jamieson

Thiel, Darren. 2010. 'Contacts and Contracts: Economic Embeddedness and Ethnic Stratification in London's Construction Market.' Ethnography. 11:3 443-471.	Ethnography	2010	3	Debates over the constitution and operation of economic markets tend to neglect their empirical variability and frequently fail to recognize the specific qualities of labour and contract markets. Based on one year's participant observation on a London construction site in 2003/4, this article demonstrates how labour and contract markets were informally regulated and reproduced, characterized by alternative exchange forms that sometimes involved illegitimate practices. Chains of informal social networks, their mores and methods of association and exchange, closed down the markets to competition and framed the development of ethnic stratification patterns. The patterns were locked in place by strong social ties that had formed in relation to the highly deregulated construction marketplace, and which came to constitute it. This revealed the construction economy as predominately socially embedded in a `moral economy' that was ultimately underpinned by violence, putting into question numerous claims from the economic sociology of markets.	1	Darren Thiel

International Migration Review. 44:3 513-538.	International Migration Review	2010	5	The relation between citizenship and labor market position is complex. Besides a causal impact from citizenship towards labor market position, several selection mechanisms may cause particular immigrants to choose for naturalization. We investigate the empirical relation on the basis of German and Dutch survey data. For the Netherlands we find a positive relation between citizenship and labor market position, while for Germany we find mixed results as citizenship is negatively related to tenured employment. The contrasting results may be explained by institutional differences. In Germany, economic self-reliance is more strictly required for naturalization than in the Netherlands. This may lead to a stronger incentive to naturalize for workers with a temporary contract in Germany.	4	Rob Euwals; Jaco Dagevos; Merove Gijsberts; Hans Roodenburg
Joona, Pernilla. 2010. 'Exits From Self-employment: Is There a Native-immigrant Difference in Sweden?.' International Migration Review. 44:3 539-559.	International Migration Review	2010	1	It is well established that non-western immigrants in Sweden are more likely to be self-employed than natives. Whether there is also a difference in the exit rate out of self-employment remains an unexplored question. Using panel data for the period 1998-2002, this study analyzes the exit rates by looking at all exits, and also at exits to different labor market states. We find that the exit rate is about 7\% points higher among non-western immigrants than among natives and exits to unemployment is 14\% points higher. Decomposing these differences, we find that differences in industry and earlier labor market status are important explanatory factors.	1	Pernilla Andersson Joona
Kesler, Christel. 2010. 'Immigrant Wage Disadvantage in Sweden and the United Kingdom: Wage Structure and Barriers to Opportunity.' International Migration Review. 44:3 560-592.	International Migration Review	2010	1	This article examines immigrant/native-born wage inequalities among workers in two Western European countries: Sweden, social democratic and with comparatively low wage dispersion, and the United Kingdom, economically liberal and with comparatively high wage dispersion. The analysis includes immigrants from 26 countries of origin. Findings demonstrate that inequalities in terms of real wages are smaller in more egalitarian Sweden. However, in terms of relative positions within the labor market, inequalities are if anything smaller in the UK. These findings highlight the role of wage dispersion in magnifying immigrant disadvantage, but also the limits of wage compression for ameliorating barriers to immigrant opportunity.	1	Christel Kesler
Brownell, Peter. 2010. 'Wages Differences Between Temporary and Permanent Immigrants.' International Migration Review. 44:3 593-614.	International Migration Review	2010	1	Temporary ``guestworker'' programs are often assumed to have less impact on native-born workers than permanent immigration. However, there are theoretical reasons to expect temporary immigrants to accept lower wages and thus for temporary migration to have a greater adverse impact on receiving country wages. This article develops these theoretical insights and tests for differences in wages paid to temporary and permanent undocumented Mexican immigrants. Survey data from Mexico shows that temporary immigrants earned wages about 12\% lower than permanent immigrants. Controlling for human and social capital, a 7.4\% difference in wages remains. Among married immigrants, temporary immigrants earn 9.6\% lower wages with these same controls.	1	Peter B. Brownell

International Migration Review. 44:3 615-658.	International Migration Review	2010	6	This paper examines the transition to a first union of descendants of Turkish immigrants in France. We use data from the project The Integration of the European Second Generation, 2007, and apply event-history techniques. We find that descendants of Turkish immigrants who grew up in France enter a first union earlier and more often in a direct marriage than do young adults without an immigrant background. We then describe the type of union in more detail and estimate the likelihood of a transnational partner choice, that is, between a young adult born in France of Turkish immigrant parentage and an immigrant from Turkey. We pay attention to social factors such as education, city of residence, and to cultural factors such as the rules of affinity in Turkey and the attachment to the norm of virginity at marriage as factors that orient partner choice. Finally, we discuss what anthropological methods could contribute to this research.	2	Nadja Milewski; Christelle Hamel
Ocepek, Melissa & Joel Fetzer. 2010. 'the Causes of Pro-immigration Voting in the United States Supreme Court.' International Migration Review. 44:3 659-696.	International Migration Review	2010	1	During the pre-confirmation debate over Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, critics accused her of allowing her background to influence her judicial decisions. This article assesses the validity of such a claim for all sitting justices from 1875 to 2007 in one relevant policy area, immigration. In this article, we look at all 185 immigration-related decisions by the Supreme Court from its creation through 2007. Logistic general estimating equation regression analysis of Supreme Court voting on these cases suggests that justices who were nominated by Democratic presidents, who were urbanites, and who had previous judicial experience were more likely to vote in favor of immigration. However, justices who grew up in the Southwest, had Southern European ancestors, or were ideological conservatives were more hostile to immigration. Although public opinion, the unemployment rate, and the percent foreign-born in a given year did not affect justices' votes, non-asylum cases and appeals from the Eighth Circuit were more likely to receive favorable treatment. The mean level of racial liberalism of the Senators in office during a particular justice's confirmation hearings likewise had a large impact on his or her subsequent rulings. These findings suggest that Supreme Court voting on immigration is substantially influenced by justices' background and political preferences as well as by some political and legal structures. These results thus support Legal Realism and New Institutionalism instead of the Traditional Legal Model of Supreme Court behavior.	2	Melissa G. Ocepek; Joel S. Fetzer
Dinesen, Peter & Marc Hooghe. 2010. 'When in Rome, Do as the Romans Do: the Acculturation of Generalized Trust Among Immigrants in Western Europe.' International Migration Review. 44:3 697-727.	International Migration Review	2010	8	The purpose of the article is to examine whether an acculturation of trust takes place among non-western immigrants upon migrating to Western Europe and whether inclusionary integration policies have an effect on this process. Building on the second and third wave of the European Social Survey (ESS) we show that an acculturation of trust does take place, but that integration policy does not affect this process. In spite of some variation across destination countries, we also find that second generation immigrants tend to adapt more to the level of trust of natives in the destination country than first generation immigrants do. This indicates that the acculturation of trust is strengthened with the second generation in the country. The results hold up when controlling for confounding variables including the trust in the country of origin of immigrants.	2	Peter Thisted Dinesen; Marc Hooghe
O'Neil, Kevin & Marta Tienda. 2010. 'a Tale of Two Counties: Natives' Opinions Toward Immigration in North Carolina.' International Migration Review. 44:3 728-761.	International Migration Review	2010	5	This article compares native residents' opinions and perceptions regarding immigration using a representative survey from a pair of matched North Carolina counties - one that experienced recent growth of its foreign-born population and one that did not. Drawing from several theoretical perspectives, including group threat, contact theory, and symbolic politics, we formulate and empirically evaluate several hypotheses. Results provide limited evidence that competition and threat influence formation of opinions about immigration, with modest support for claims that parents with school-aged children harbor more negative views of immigration than their childless counterparts. Except for residents in precarious economic situations, these negative opinions appear unrelated to the immigrant composition of the community. Claims that the media promotes negative views of immigration receive limited support, but this relationship is unrelated to the volume of local immigration. Finally, sustained contacts with foreign-born residents outside work environments are associated with positive views of immigration, but superficial contacts appear to be conducive to anti-immigration sentiments. Political orientation, educational attainment, and indicators of respondents' tolerance for diversity explain most of the difference between the two counties in overall support for immigration.	2	Kevin O'Neil; Marta Tienda
Ottoni-Wilhelm, Mark. 2010. 'Giving to Organizations That Help People in Need: Differences Across Denominational Identities.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:3 389-412.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	2	This article uses multiple-year data to examine charitable giving to organizations that help people in need of food, shelter, or other basic necessities. Families that give to basic necessity organizations in any single year are a mix of occasional givers and regular givers. Controlling for family characteristics that affect giving, giving to basic necessity organizations does not vary across Christian denominations and nonaffiliated families in any notable way. However, Jewish families are both more likely to give and, when they do give, give larger amounts. Given recent policy interest in how churches, synagogues, and mosques help with the voluntary provision of a safety net for people in need, the results draw attention to the importance of a research agenda focused on the differences between occasional givers and regular givers and on explaining why Jewish families give more to organizations that help people in need.	1	Mark Ottoni-Wilhelm

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:3 413-424.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	5	Studies have attempted to understand the association between more conventional supernatural (religious) beliefs and practices and less conventional ``paranormal'' supernatural beliefs. Some have posited that the two comprise incompatible cultural spheres and belief systems, while others have argued that supernatural religious beliefs are ``small steps'' toward less conventional paranormal views (such as belief in astrology and telekinesis). We build upon recent scholarship outlining a more nuanced, nonlinear relationship between religiosity and paranormal beliefs by identifying a specific niche of believers who are particularly likely to dabble in unconventional supernatural beliefs. Strong believers in the paranormal tend to be characterized by a nonexclusive spiritualist worldview, as opposed to materialist or exclusive religious outlooks. Paranormal believers tend to be characterized by moderate levels of religious belief and practice, and low levels of ideological exclusivity. In general, the relationship between more conventional religiosity and paranormal beliefs is best conceptualized as curvilinear.	2	Joseph O. Baker; Scott Draper

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:3 425-438.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	4	We theoretically and empirically evaluate Allport's intrinsic-extrinsic and Batson's quest religious orientations through the lens of self-determination theory (SDT) and Wulff's social-cognitive model. Confirming our theoretical analysis, we find that Allport's intrinsic-extrinsic dichotomy fails to correspond empirically to the differentiation between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation within SDT. Whereas Allport's intrinsic religious orientation was positively related to internalized extrinsic motivation, his two extrinsic (i.e., personal and social) religious orientations were not systematically related to any of the discerned motives within SDT. Furthermore, Batson's quest orientation was unrelated to any of the SDT concepts but was positively related to symbolic disbelief. The present findings suggest that Allport's motivational orientations model needs both refinement and relabeling to better fit with recent theoretical evolutions in the field of motivational psychology.	4	Bart Neyrinck; Willy Lens; Maarten Vansteenkiste; Bart Soenens

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:3 439-455.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	1	An implicit measure of religiousness-spirituality (RS) was constructed and used in two studies. In Study 1, undergraduates completed a Religiousness-Spirituality Implicit Association Test (RS-IAT) and several self-report measures of RS and related constructs (e.g., religious fundamentalism, authoritarianism). Informants rated the participants' RS. The RS-IAT was internally consistent. Implicit RS correlated positively with self-reported RS, spiritual transcendence, spiritual experiences, religious fundamentalism, and intrinsic religiousness. Informant ratings correlated positively with participants' self-reported religiousness but not implicit RS. In Study 2, implicit RS accounted for unique variability in self-reported attitudes toward gay men and lesbian women when controlling for self-reported religiousness and right-wing authoritarianism. These findings demonstrate that an implicit measure of trait RS explains some variability in attitudes that self-report measures do not. An implicit measure of RS could advance the scientific study of religion beyond what is known from self-report measures.	5	Jordan P. LaBouff; Wade C. Rowatt; Megan K.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	4	This experiment examined the effects of online Christian disclosure. Respondents (N = 233) viewed a fictional social networking profile containing one of three levels of Christian disclosure frequency: none, nominal, and extensive. Respondents made few distinctions between nondisclosure and nominal disclosure. Most notably, respondent religiosity moderated impressions. Regardless of disclosure level, religious respondents rated profile owners as more likeable and less stereotypically negative than less religious respondents. The least religious respondents tended to rate the extensively disclosing Christian as least romantically desirable and with more negative stereotyping. The most religious respondents rated the extensively disclosing Christian as most likeable and as most romantically desirable. Christian identity tended to be assumed when not disclosed. Nominal disclosure may constitute a socially acceptable level of online Christian disclosure.	2	Piotr S. Bobkowski; Sriram Kalyanaraman

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	0	Religious affiliation and employment bias is examined in Athens, Greece by implementing an experimental field study. Labor market outcomes (occupation access, entry wage, and wait time for call back) are assessed for three religious minorities (Pentecostal, evangelical, and Jehovah's Witnesses) compared to the religious majority (Greek Orthodox). Results indicate that religious minorities experience employment bias as measured by access to job interviews, entry wages, and wait time for call backs. Moreover, religious minorities face greater constraints on occupational access in more prestigious jobs compared to less prestigious jobs. Occupational access and entry wage bias is highest for religious minority women. In all cases, Jehovah's Witnesses face the greatest bias; female employers offered significantly lower entry wages to Jehovah's Witnesses than male employers.	1	Nick Drydakis

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:3 494-506.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	2	The Golden Rule, a core precept of many religions, emphasizes the importance of treating others with compassion. We examined whether priming Golden Rule messages would influence Buddhists' and Christians' attitudes toward gay people and perceptions that homosexuality is a choice. In a priming task, participants filled in missing words for popular quotations including two Golden Rule messages that were attributed to either Buddha or Jesus. Christians (N = 585) in the Buddha-attributed Golden Rule condition showed stronger explicit anti-gay attitudes and were more likely to agree that homosexuality is a choice than Christians in the Jesus-attributed or control conditions, eta(2)(p) = .012, p = .035, even after controlling for political orientation and religiosity. Buddhists (N = 394) showed no variation in attitudes across priming conditions, eta(2)(p) = .001, p = .78. Our results suggest that although the Golden Rule has an important influence on believers, its message of compassion may produce more prejudice if it comes from an outgroup source compared to an ingroup source.	3	Oth T.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:3 507-516.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	1	Chronic pain (CP) is a stressful condition that severely impacts individuals' lives. Researchers have begun to explore the role of religion for CP patients, but the literature is scarce, especially for West European populations. Drawing from the transactional theory of stress, this study examined the associations between the religious meaning system and the life satisfaction for a group of CP patients who were members of a Flemish patients' association. To take into account the religious landscape of West European countries, the centrality of one's religious meaning system, rather than religious content, was the focus. Results from the questionnaires completed by 207 patients suggest that the centrality of a meaning system is an important factor in the promotion of life satisfaction for this group, above and beyond the influence of several control variables. Furthermore, the centrality of the religious meaning system moderated or buffered the detrimental influence of pain severity on life satisfaction.	4	Jessie Dezutter; Linda A.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	8	Using data from a 2001-2002 sample of adults aged 65 and older living in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, we examine the associations among religious involvement (as measured by the frequency of attendance at religious services and praying), the belief in divine control, and the sense of mattering-a key component of the self-concept. We also assess the extent to which these patterns vary by gender, race, and education. Findings indicate indirect effects of religious attendance on mattering through divine control beliefs and the frequency of social contact. Praying increases mattering indirectly only through divine control beliefs. Moreover, divine control beliefs are more strongly associated with mattering among women, African Americans, and individuals with less education. We discuss the contribution of these findings for theory about the links between religious involvement, beliefs about God, and psychosocial resources, and the influence of core dimensions of social status and stratification.	3	Scott Schieman; Alex Bierman; Christopher G.

Overweight or obese prevalence was measured using World Health Organization standards for Asians (BMI > 23). Respondents reported the frequency of messages discouraging ``excessive eating'' or encouraging ``exercise'' from religious leaders and congregants during a typical month. When conditioned on leaders' messages, the frequency of congregants' messages was associated with a significantly lower probability of being overweight or obese, although messages from either in the absence of the other were unassociated with being overweight or obese. At least for Korean women, religion may help prevent obesity via religious-based social mechanisms.	7	John W. Ayers; C. Richard Hofstetter; Veronica L.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	2	Two major gaps exist in research examining the positive association between religious attendance and happiness. First, scholars have argued that this association may be because of people's perceived relationship with God or the social cohesion one experiences with other parishioners, but scholars have not studied both pathways simultaneously. Using nationally representative cross-sectional data (General Social Survey), I first examine the influence of one's perceived relationship with God and one's perceived social cohesion within the religious community on happiness. One's perceived relationship with God is more strongly associated with happiness than is social cohesion. Second, scholars overwhelmingly use religious attendance as the independent variable, with happiness as the dependent variable. Using two waves of data from a nationally representative panel study (National Survey of Families and Households), I then examine the relationship between religious attendance and happiness over time, finding that religious attendance has a greater effect on happiness than happiness has on religious attendance.	1	Ellen Childs

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:3 561-568.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	5	Using a sample of college students (N = 904) from the ``Bible Belt,'' this study examines the effect of religiosity and self-control on late adolescents' delay in initiating sexual intercourse or oral sex. Findings from logistic regressions provide evidence that for each one unit increase in self-control, the odds of a male remaining a virgin or of delaying oral sex increased by a factor of 1.82 and 2.84, respectively, while for females, the odds of not engaging in oral sex increased by a factor of 1.67. In addition to the effect of self-control, a one unit increase in religiosity results in the odds of a male remaining a virgin by a factor of 3.86 and 3.30, respectively. For females the odds are increased by a factor of 4.13 and 2.60, respectively. Mediation tests also provided evidence that self-control mediated the effects by religiosity on both dependent measures. Thus, both religiosity and self-control independently and additively function as key social control mechanisms that promote late adolescent health.	2	Alexander T. Vazsonyi; Dusty D. Jenkins
Schnittker, Jason. 2010. 'Gene-environment Correlations in the Stress-depression Relationship.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:3 229-243.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	1	A critical feature of the social stress model is the apparent relationship between stress and depression. Although many studies have demonstrated a connection between the two, the relationship may be contaminated by genes affecting both stress and depression. Using a sample of identical and fraternal twins, this study explores genetic influences on depression and assorted sources of stress while explicitly estimating, and thereby controlling for, gene-environment correlations. I consider both stress and depression in a fine-grained fashion. For the former, the study explores assorted sources of stress, including health and disability, family, unemployment, discrimination, and perceived neighborhood safety, as gene-environment correlations may be stronger for some forms of stress than others. For the latter, the study explores both depressive symptoms and major depressive disorders, as each may entail a different epidemiological process, especially with respect to genes. The results reveal that most, but not all, measures of stress have moderate heritabilities, suggesting that genes influence exposure to the environment in a broad fashion. Yet, despite this, the relationship between stress and depression is generally robust to gene-environment correlations. There are some notable exceptions. For example, allowing for gene-environment correlations, marital conflict is generally unrelated to depression. Moreover, gene-environment correlations are generally stronger for major depression than for depressive symptoms, encouraging further elaboration of the distinction between the onset of depression and its recurrence, especially in the context of genes. These exceptions do not put limits on environmental influence, but do suggest that genes operate in a complex life-course fashion.	1	Jason Schnittker

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	5	Drawing on stress and life-course perspectives and using panel data from 1,286 south Florida young adults, we assess three critical questions regarding the role of marijuana in the ``gateway hypothesis.'' First, does teen marijuana use independently (causally) affect subsequent use of more dangerous substances? Second, if so, does that effect apply to the abuse of other illicit substances, as defined by the DSM-IV, or only to the use of such substances? Finally, does any causal effect of teen marijuana use survive beyond adolescence, or is it a short-term effect that subsides as adolescents transition to adulthood? Our results indicate a moderate relation between early teen marijuana use and young adult abuse of other illicit substances; however, this association fades from statistical significance with adjustments for stress and life-course variables. Likewise, our findings show that any causal influence of teen marijuana use on other illicit substance use is contingent upon employment status and is short-term, subsiding entirely by the age of 21. In light of these findings, we urge U. S. drug control policymakers to consider stress and life-course approaches in their pursuit of solutions to the ``drug problem.''	2	Karen Van; Cesar J.

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	0	Using two waves of the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, I compare changes in personal growth over a 10 year period among cancer survivors and individuals without cancer. Moreover, I examine joint effects of age and cohort on personal growth after a cancer diagnosis. The theoretical framework of this study integrates impairment, resilience, and thriving perspectives. Findings reveal that, although personal growth declines with age for all individuals regardless of cohort and cancer status, cancer slows the decline in personal growth with age in 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s birth cohorts, yet accelerates the age-related decline in the 1920s cohort. I argue that a sociological perspective can enhance our understanding of the interplay of developmental and sociocultural influences on psychological adjustment to cancer. Seemingly idiosyncratic psychological reactions to cancer partly reflect macrolevel processes represented by cohort differences.	1	Tetyana Pudrovska

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	9	In this study, we take a dynamic approach to studying the connections among mothers' education, their depression, and their children's academic trajectories during elementary school. Applying latent growth curve modeling to longitudinal data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development's Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (N = 1,012), we find that maternal depression does not mediate the association between mothers' education and children's achievement. Instead, maternal education moderates the association between maternal depression and children's achievement. Specifically, maternal depression only predicted lower achievement for children of women who did not pursue higher education. These results highlight the role of mothers' mental health in the intergenerational linkage between mothers' and children's educational experiences.	2	Jennifer March Augustine; Robert Crosnoe

Using 38 years of longitudinal data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics ( PSID), we clarify the relationship between child and adult neighborhood quality and self-reported adult health, using sibling fixed effects models. Overall, we find support for positive long-term health effects, both for growing up in affluent neighborhoods and for growing up in neighborhoods where one is surrounded by comparative advantage. Relative to childhood neighborhood factors, adult neighborhoods have little to no effect in almost every model specification. We find mixed evidence, as well, that these relationships are stronger for nonwhites than for whites. Our findings suggest that childhood is a critical point for intervention in the long-term health effects of residential conditions.	2	Thomas P. Vartanian; Linda Houser

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	16	The suicide rate among American adolescents between the ages of 14-25 has dramatically increased during the last 50 years, and this fact has been the focus of extensive social-scientific investigation. To date, however, research focusing on the joint effects of mental health, family, and contextual-level predictors on adolescents' suicidal behaviors is scarce. Drawing on Durkheim's classic macro-level approach to suicide and collective efficacy theory, we use data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) to examine the effect of informal social controls on adolescents' suicide attempts. Analyzing reports from 990 youth, we examine the hypothesis that neighborhood-level collective efficacy and family-level integration and social control independently affect suicide attempts. We also examine the extent to which they interact in their effects on suicidal behavior. Overall, results from multilevel logit models support the Durkheimian expectation that family attachment reduces the probability that adolescents will attempt suicide. The effect of collective efficacy is interactive in nature. Specifically, we find that collective efficacy significantly enhances the protective effect of family attachment and support on adolescent suicidal behaviors. We discuss findings within the context of social control theory.	3	David Maimon; Christopher R. Browning; Jeanne Brooks-Gunn
Scheitle, Christopher & Amy Adamczyk. 2010. 'High-cost Religion, Religious Switching, and Health.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:3 325-342.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	2	Previous research has devoted significant attention to understanding the link between health and personal religious beliefs and practices, typically finding that more religious people tend to have better health. However, almost no attention has been given to how switching religious groups or leaving religion altogether is related to self-reported health. Due to selection and causation mechanisms, switching from high-cost groups that are theologically and culturally exclusive could be associated with poor health more than switching from other religious groups. Using data from the 1972 through 2006 General Social Surveys, we examine the relationship between health and religious switching as moderated by the religious tradition of origin. We find that people who are raised and stay in high-cost sectarian groups, such as the Latter-day Saints and Jehovah's Witnesses, have better self-reported health than those raised and staying in other religious traditions. However, people who leave such groups are more likely to report worse health than those who leave other groups.	2	Christopher P. Scheitle; Amy Adamczyk

Compared to attending services less than once a month or never, attending services once a week but no more is associated with fewer depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms. Hypothesized mediators, including meaning, interpersonal and self-forgiveness, congregational criticism, social attendance beliefs, and negative coping are independently associated with one or more mental health outcomes.	4	Michelle J.

McCarthy Award for Lifetime Achievement in the Scholarship of Social Movements and Collective Action has subsequently been presented to Verta Taylor (2008), Mayer Zald (2009), and Doug McAdam (2010). As part of each year's award ceremony, the McCarthy Award winner gives a public lecture that reflects on her or his past contributions to the field of social movement research, while also looking forward to prom-ising lines of future inquiry. The publication in Mobilization of these lectures highlights both the important role recipients have played in shaping the field of social movement research, as well as their unique perspectives on where the field is headed. To this end each award winner has generously collaborated with Mobilization in the publication of an article based on the original McCarthy Award lecture. We are pleased to share Mayer N. Zald's contribution in this issue. McCarthy Award lectures from other recipients will appear in future issues as they become available to us.	1	Mayer N. Zald
Moghadam, Valentine & Elham Gheytanchi. 2010. 'Political Opportunities and Strategic Choices: Comparing Feminist Campaigns in Morocco and Iran.' Mobilization. 15:3 267-288.	Mobilization	2010	3	How do women's rights activists mobilize in nondemocratic and culturally conservative contexts? Why do some women's movements succeed in securing the policy outcomes they seek while others fail to realize their objectives? Comparing two recent cases of feminist activism in the Middle East/North Africa region the Moroccan and Iranian campaigns for family law reform the article demonstrates the way that political opportunity structures shape the strategic options available to activists and influence movement frames. While a political opening is conducive to movement growth and success, including cooperation for legal and policy reform (Morocco), the closing of political space compels extrainstitutional feminist contention and transnational links (Iran). In examining the structure of political opportunity in addition to strategic choices, the paper addresses the interplay of structure and agency in mobilization processes and finds that-to paraphrase Marx-women and men make history, but not under conditions of their own choosing.	2	Valentine M.

Myers, Daniel. 2010. 'Violent Protest and Heterogeneous Diffusion Processes: the Spread of U.s. Racial Rioting From 1964 to 1971.' Mobilization. 15:3 289-321.	Mobilization	2010	1	This analysis of the diffusion of racial rioting in the United States applies recently developed extensions of event history analysis to the spread of rioting from 1969 to 1971. Contrary to early analyses of riot diffusion, the results demonstrate that diffusion is a critical force behind the pattern of rioting. The analysis identifies several types of diffusion in the riot cycle, demonstrating that contagious influence from riots decays over tune, is mitigated by geographic distance, and is conditional on riot severity. Methodologically, the analysis produces extensions of prior event-history diffusion models that facilitate their use with collective violence and protest data.	1	Daniel I. Myers
Opp, Karl-Dieter & Hermann Brandstaetter. 2010. 'Political Protest and Personality Traits: a Neglected Link.' Mobilization. 15:3 323-346.	Mobilization	2010	3	We examine the extent to which personality traits and variables based on the theory of collective action (i.e., incentives) can explain protest participation. We use the Big Five personality traits, measured by a list of bipolar adjectives: Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism. Incentives are political discontent and perceived personal influence, perceived obligation to protest and social incentives (i.e., integration in protest encouraging social networks). We hypothesize that personality traits have an effect on incentives and, together with incentives, on protest behavior. We test our hypotheses with a two-wave panel study, conducted in Leipzig (East Germany), where a total of 438 pet-sons were interviewed in 1993 and 1996. Major findings are that personality traits have only weak effects on protest, compared to the variables of the theory of collective action, and that personality traits have various effects on the independent variables (i.e., the incentives) of the theory of collective action.	2	Karl-Dieter Opp; Hermann Brandstaetter
Van, Jeroen. 2010. 'Activists Online and Offline: the Internet as an Information Channel for Protest Demonstrations.' Mobilization. 15:3 347-366.	Mobilization	2010	4	Using individual-level data of protest participants in nine different protest demonstrations in Belgium, this article compares activists using the Internet and activists not using the Internet as an information channel about an upcoming demonstration. We find that ``online'' and ``offline'' activists differ significantly in terms of sociodemographic and political backgrounds, formal network and organizational embeddedness, and, to some extent, motivational aspects. The findings suggest that using digital communication channels likely extends and narrows the mobilizing potential to a public of experienced, organizationally embedded activists. The Internet is principally used by ``superactivists'' who are experienced and highly educated, and, who simultaneously combine multiple engagements. The article then discusses these results in light of two focal problems: that the Internet reinforces participation inequalities, and that the Internet might prove insufficient for sustained collective action participation and the maintenance of future social movement organizations.	1	Jeroen Van
Wooten, Melissa. 2010. 'Soliciting Elites: the Framing Activities of the United Negro College Fund.' Mobilization. 15:3 367+.	Mobilization	2010	0	Framing is widely recognized as an effective tool for resource mobilization, and much attention has been devoted to understanding the use of frames to mobilize participants. Less attention has been devoted to the use of frames to solicit wealth v donors despite knowledge that resource mobilization often includes this task as well. In this article, the case of the United Negro College Fund (UNCF) is used to analyze framing designed to elicit financial support from wealthy constituents. A frame analysis of the UNCF's mobilizing efforts between 1944 and 1954 is performed using qualitative data and methods. Findings indicate that soliciting support from wealthy constituents requires framing movement activity as though it will not lead to widespread change, even if logic or history suggest otherwise.	1	Melissa E.

Ollion, Etienne. 2010. 'Summits of Information: Advocacy Officers, Journalists, and Newsmaking at International Summits.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:3 211-227.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	0	In spite of the growing visibility of international summits in the last decade, little is known about how these events actually unfold. Neither the role played by the media in these highly scrutinized gatherings, nor the organizational setting in which news is produced, have been extensively described. Focusing on one such summit, this article shows what a close-up view of the otherwise-invisible Media Center can offer to sociological analysis. Year after year, these spaces have increasingly been colonized by certain NGOs attempting to influence the proceedings of these summits. This article highlights some overlooked factors that make some groups better able than others to promote their perspective, and lays bare a mechanism I call mediated pressure, by which journalists try to influence negotiators through the dissemination of their claims in the news.	1	Etienne Ollion
Rivera, Lauren. 2010. 'Status Distinctions in Interaction: Social Selection and Exclusion at an Elite Nightclub.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:3 229-255.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	3	Although social status plays a crucial role in the generation and maintenance of social inequalities, how status processes operate in naturalistic social contexts remains less clear. In the following article, I provide a case study of doormen-individuals who simultaneously represent status experts and status judges-at a highly exclusive nightclub to investigate how people draw status distinctions in micro-social settings. Using interview and ethnographic data, I analyze on what bases doormen evaluate the relative worth of patrons and confer the status prize of admission. I find that in making such decisions, doormen drew from a constellation of competence and esteem cues, which were informed by contextually specific status schemas about the relative material, moral, and symbolic worth of particular client groups. Moreover, the ways in which doormen used these cues and schema depended on the identity of the specific patron being evaluated. As such, I argue that processes of interpersonal evaluation and status conferral are contextually specific, culturally embedded, and interpersonally variable. Despite such variations, a patron's perceived social connections seemed to outweigh other types of cues in admissions decisions. I conclude by discussing these findings in light of both status characteristics theory and Bourdieu's work on the transubstantiation of capital to suggest that social capital is a powerful status cue that can, under certain conditions, be a more potent source of social distinction and status advantage, or hold a greater conversion value, in systems of stratification than other types of qualities.	1	Lauren A.

Torkelson, Jason. 2010. 'Life After (straightedge) Subculture.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:3 257-274.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	1	This paper uses 20 in-depth interviews with individuals who formerly identified as straightedge to explore a largely overlooked but potentially important dimension of youth subcultures: life after subculture. Interviews illustrate the potential importance of life after subculture for gaining a fuller understanding of subculture and indicate that residue from former subcultural affiliation can be a marker of a group's relative substance. Interviews additionally underscore problems with prevailing theoretical models of subculture and support the claim that approaches to and conceptions of subculture should attend to phenomenological levels of analysis and potentialities.	1	Jason Torkelson
Gazit, Nir & Yael Maoz-Shai. 2010. 'Studying-up and Studying-across: At-home Research of Governmental Violence Organizations.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:3 275-295.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	0	Studying the military and other security organizations is challenging for both methodological and ethical reasons. Studying these domains ``at home,'' literally in the researcher's own country, complicates things even further. This article discusses these intricacies by proposing a dynamic conceptualization of the subject-object relationship in the study of the military and security in Israel. This conceptualization illuminates the effects of the dynamic positioning of the researcher in four social fields: the academic, the military-security, gender, and the ethno-national. The actual influence of these fields and their interrelations changes throughout the phases of research. We argue that when researchers and their respondents have similar ethno-national affiliation and military experiences, the dichotomous relations between them break down and give way to a dense web of expectations. This brings the researcher to maneuver between two, ostensibly contradictory, research strategies: studying-up and studying-across. The paper unpacks the complexities encapsulated in these strategies by discussing methodological and ethical dilemmas in two field studies on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict conducted by the authors.	2	Nir Gazit; Yael Maoz-Shai
Kramer, Ronald. 2010. 'Moral Panics and Urban Growth Machines: Official Reactions to Graffiti in New York City, 1990-2005.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:3 297-311.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	2	This paper analyzes the official response to graffiti writing in New York City throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century. Drawing from a variety of documents, such as newspaper articles, political press releases, internal memos and government reports, I show that the city's reaction to graffiti constitutes a moral panic and that the significance of this response can be discerned when interpreted in the context of theoretical insights developed by urban sociologists. On this basis, I argue that moral panics, or at least a sub-set of panics, may be central to negotiating the social conflict that accompanies the ways in which (urban) space will be put to use.	1	Ronald Kramer
Newmahr, Staci. 2010. 'Rethinking Kink: Sadomasochism as Serious Leisure.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:3 313-331.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	5	Based on extensive ethnographic research in a public SM (sadomasochism) community, this paper frames SM as recreation. Drawing on Robert Stebbins' work on ``serious leisure'' (1982), I posit that in order to more adequately understand SM as it occurs in this community, we need to shift from mainstream assumptions of SM as (simply) ``kinky sex'' to a more nuanced perspective. I explore the unique skills required in order to engage in SM, as well as the benefits and rewards that participants derive from it, in order to illustrate that SM can be more usefully understood as serious leisure.	1	Staci Newmahr
Banks, Patricia. 2010. 'Conceptions of Art Ownership as a Form of Wealth Accumulation Among the Black Middle-class.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:3 333-348.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	0	While there is a rich sociological tradition of analyzing the consumption of middle-class blacks, theory and research have overwhelmingly conceptualized middle-class blacks as conspicuous consumers. This paper develops an alternative theoretical approach to black middle-class consumption. Using the case of art ownership, I elaborate how middle-class blacks understand consumption as a practice that maintains and reinforces their class position by building wealth. Drawing on 103 in-depth interviews with black middle-class consumers of visual art, I illustrate how middle-class blacks view art as an economic asset and consider investment potential when they purchase art. I also document how middle-class blacks view art as a source of wealth that can be transferred across generations. Theory which accounts for black middle-class consumption from the perspective of wealth building is critical given long-standing arguments that middle-class blacks are a group whose frivolous and status-driven consumption jeopardizes their accumulation of wealth. The theoretical approach outlined in this paper illustrates how middle-class blacks approach consumption with an eye to solidifying their economic position.	1	Patricia A. Banks
Dempsey, Nicholas. 2010. 'Stimulated Recall Interviews in Ethnography.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:3 349-367.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	0	This article describes the use of stimulated recall interviews as a technique for investigating how people approach interactions in a number of different situations. In general, the technique I describe involves interviewing individuals by playing them audio or audiovisual recordings of their own behavior in social situations and discussing different aspects of those recorded interactions. Doing so can help us to understand what signals interactants understand as important, what signals they try to convey to others, and how they choose from various options to act upon the information they receive in interactions. Using the example of jazz jam sessions, I ask why it is that interactions can sometimes go smoothly and uneventfully, or sometimes break down completely. The stimulated recall interviews provide a valuable tool in helping the ethnographer to answer these kinds of questions.	1	Nicholas P. Dempsey
Baiocchi, Gianpaolo & Lisa Corrado. 2010. 'the Politics of Habitus: Publics, Blackness, and Community Activism in Salvador, Brazil.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:3 369-388.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	1	This paper explores how politics is experienced by actors who mediate neighborhood organizations and formal political institutions in the Northeastern city of Salvador da Bahia, in Brazil. It is based on a series of ethnographic interviews in 2004 among identified community leaders in the city's poorer neighborhoods, with attention to their politics of habitus-their socially-situated modes of expression of political proclivities. While all of our informants identified themselves as Black and identified racial structures as shaping their lives, their understandings and evaluations of formal politics were divided. Those who only mediated between the neighborhood and formal institutions were critical of the world of politics and its polluting influence. Those who were also involved in mediating publics tended to experience formal politics as unjust but ultimately accessible through legitimate Black political action. This distinction helps account for the difficulty in mobilizing around a reformist political project and adds a local and political dimension to the understanding of race relations in Brazil.	2	Gianpaolo Baiocchi; Lisa Corrado
Brumley, Krista. 2010. 'Understanding Mexican Ngos: Goals, Strategies, and the Local Context.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:3 389-414.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	3	Research on non-governmental organizations (NGOs) largely focuses on the actions taken towards contributing to social change in communities and has characterized them into a typology of resisters or cooperators. Using extensive qualitative data, I use this case study to illustrate that NGOs use multiple repertoires of strategies that range from low to high risk. In this article, I show how and why NGO leaders in Monterrey, Mexico, choose their strategies based on their interpretation of the local sociopolitical environment and their assessment of how politically challenging a goal is within that context. By setting aside the dichotomy of NGOs as cooperators or resisters, I demonstrate the connection between strategies, goals, and the local sociopolitical context that is largely missing in our theorizing of NGOs (and other forms of collective action). These findings have implications for understanding how NGOs, as social actors, participate in an increasingly complex and interconnected global space.	1	Krista M. Brumley
Wuthnow, Robert. 2010. 'H. Paul Douglass Lecture: Heaven Is a Wonderful Place: the Role of Reasonableness in Religious Discourse.' Review of Religious Research. 52:1 5-20.	Review of Religious Research	2010	0	The United States is one of the best educated countries in the world, and yet a large proportion of the public claims to believe in the existence of heaven. To understand why there is relatively little apparent conflict between reason and faith about this topic, I examine the language devices subjects use in qualitative interviews to avoid appearing unreasonable when talking about heaven. I discuss references to religious authority and associated disclaimers, registers and register shifts, symbolic contrasts between heaven and earth, and expressions of ambivalence about who goes to heaven and how wonderful it may be.	1	Robert Wuthnow
Huber, Stefan & Matthias Richard. 2010. 'the Inventory of Emotions Towards God (etg): Psychological Valences and Theological Issues.' Review of Religious Research. 52:1 21-40.	Review of Religious Research	2010	0	An inventory that measures emotions towards God (EtG) proves to be valid. The inventory consists of 16 items that cover emotions that subjects most likely experience in relation to God. The factorial structure of the inventory is described, and the inventory is validated by exploring correlations with a number of conceptually close and remote variables. The results show that the EtG is a short and valid measure with two orthogonal factors (positive and negative emotions) that represent the psychological valence of different emotions towards God. Each factor is comprised of three inter-correlated components that refer to specific emotional qualities that are related to corresponding theological issues. The two main scales have sound psychometric properties and show discriminant and convergent validity and are moderately associated with conceptually related constructs, like dispositional affect and experiential dimensions of religiosity. They do not correlate with distant constructs such as personality dimensions. The EtG is a feasible instrument that can be used to screen basic emotional tendencies towards God. The dimension of negative emotions towards God is of special interest because of its low correlation with general religiosity and potential use in counselling.	2	Stefan Huber; Matthias Richard
Neff, James. 2010. 'Confirmatory Factor Analysis Validation of a Four-factor Measure of Spirituality-religiosity for Use in Diverse Substance Abuse Treatment Populations.' Review of Religious Research. 52:1 41-56.	Review of Religious Research	2010	0	This paper replicates and extends previous analyses supporting the dimensionality of a new measure of spirituality-religiosity designed for largely minority participants in substance abuse treatment. Data are presented from participants in explicitly faith-based substance abuse treatment programs (Teen Challenge), and multi-group confirmatoty factor analysis techniques are applied to assess the invariance of the factor structure, comparing data from the new Teen Challenge validation sample with the correlation matrix from the initial scale development sample. Model,fit in the present analyses reached acceptable levels with the addition of error covariances. Further invariance tests comparing scale development and Teen Challenge validation samples did not suggest systematic variation in loadings between groups. The present comparisons support the originally proposed four-dimensional structure while supporting the use of the measure in both traditional and faith-based programs. Strengths of the present analyses include: use of diverse treatment programs in several states as well as increased precision of the present CFA findings, as program level effects (i.e., intra-class correlations) have been removed through use of residualized data in the analyses.	1	James Alan Neff
Robbins, Mandy & Leslie Francis. 2010. 'Work-related Psychological Health and Psychological Type Among Church of England Clergywomen.' Review of Religious Research. 52:1 57-71.	Review of Religious Research	2010	1	Using the balanced affect model of work-related psychological health proposed and measured by the Francis Burnout Inventory, this paper set out to assess the work-related psychological health of a sample of 874 stipendiary parochial clergywomen working within the Church of England, to examine the association between work-related psychological health and psychological type as assessed by the Francis Psychological Type Scales. The data demonstrate that these clergywomen experience a high level of emotional exhaustion, often offset by a high level of satisfaction in ministry, but that these levels are roughly consistent with those reported by clergymen and clergywomen working in other cultural and denominational contexts. In terms of psychological type theory, the data demonstrate that extraverts and feelers enjoy a better level of work-related psychological health in comparison with introverts and thinkers. This finding is consistent with the view that introverted thinking clergywomen may find themselves operating in ministry for long periods with their less preferred orientation of extraversion and their less preferred judging function of feeling. Suggestions are offered to help introverted and thinking clergy deal more effectively with the stresses of ministry.	2	Mandy Robbins; Leslie Francis
Krause, Neal. 2010. 'Church-based Emotional Support and Self-forgiveness in Late Life.' Review of Religious Research. 52:1 72-89.	Review of Religious Research	2010	0	The intent of this study is to see whether emotional support from fellow church members is associated with self-forgiveness in late life. The data come from a longitudinal nationwide survey of older adults. An effort is made to contribute to the literature by comparing and contrasting the effects of two church-based support measures: the amount of emotional support that is provided by fellow church members and satisfaction with emotional support from co-religionists. The findings suggest that older study participants who are more satisfied with the emotional support they have received from the members of their church are more likely to forgive themselves than older people who are not satisfied with the emotional support they have received in church. In contrast, significant effects failed to emerge with the measure of the amount of received emotional support.	1	Neal Krause

Review of Religious Research	2010	2	In this paper, we consider two related subfields of contemporary social-scientific research: secularization theory and the analysis of the relationship between nationalism and religion. After reviewing major developments and perspectives in these research areas, we argue that there are good grounds for hypothesizing that nationalism plays an important role in fomenting processes of institutional differentiation, and thus is likely a cause of secularization. We close by providing a series of four conjectures and two corollary questions that could serve as the basis of a common research program in this area.	2	Jonathan Eastwood; Nikolas Prevalakis
Slack, Tim. 2010. 'Working Poverty Across the Metro-nonmetro Divide: a Quarter Century in Perspective, 1979-2003.' Rural Sociology. 75:3 363-387.	Rural Sociology	2010	2	P>Researchers are increasingly recognizing space as a key axis of inequality. Scholars concerned with spatial inequality have called for special attention to issues of comparative advantage and disadvantage across space as well as the consideration of the subnational scale. This study draws on these ideas by examining the relationship between work and poverty in the United States with an explicit comparative focus on metropolitan (metro) and nonmetropolitan (nonmetro) areas. Moreover, this study joins space with its counterpart time by exploring how this relationship has changed over the last quarter century. Using data from the March Current Population Survey, the results show that working poverty persistently had a disproportionate impact on nonmetro families between 1979 and 2003. However, the results also show a trend of residential convergence, as working poverty in metro areas has climbed toward the levels experienced in nonmetro areas. Logistic-regression models exploring the effects of residence, family labor supply, and period confirm that labor supply has consistently provided nonmetro families with less protection from poverty than their metro counterparts, but also show that this disadvantage has waned in recent years. The findings underscore the need for policies that support those working on the economic margins and recognize the variable opportunity costs of employment across the rural-urban continuum.	1	Tim Slack
Schwartz, Jennifer & Arina Gertseva. 2010. 'Stability and Change in Female and Male Violence Across Rural and Urban Counties, 1981-2006.' Rural Sociology. 75:3 388-425.	Rural Sociology	2010	0	P>Two durable criminological patterns have been higher violence rates in urban compared to rural areas and by males compared to females. To derive and evaluate hypotheses related to correspondence across place and sex groups in changes in violence trends, we draw on a spatial-inequality perspective that attends to the geographic distribution of inequalities at the subnational scale, as well as to recent extensions of social-disorganization theory to variation in rural and female violence rates. Our study's focus is on systematically delineating the extent and timing of change in female and male violence trends, the rural-urban violence gap, and the gender gap. We apply epidemiological joinpoint techniques to Uniform Crime Reports arrest data from completely rural to highly urbanized settings for several violent offenses (homicide, robbery, aggravated assault, and misdemeanor assault) between 1981 and 2006. Female and male violence rates in rural to urban settings generally followed the same course over 25 years. Analyses generally indicated parallel violence trends of rural and urban females and males and only subtle changes in the rural-urban and gender gaps in serious violence. Serious violence became somewhat less concentrated in urban centers owing to more sizable urban rate declines after the mid-1990s. In all contexts, the gender gap in assault arrests narrowed, but the female share of serious violence (homicide, robbery) remained much the same; this result suggests change in the social control of minor violence by females across rural and urban settings.	2	Jennifer Schwartz; Arina Gertseva
Kay, David, Charles Geisler & Nelson Bills. 2010. 'Residential Preferences: What's Terrorism Got to Do With It?.' Rural Sociology. 75:3 426-454.	Rural Sociology	2010	1	P>Security has long been recognized as an element in residential preference and its relative importance has risen with fear of extremist attacks on U.S. cities. Using polling data from 2004, this research investigates whether the security breaches of 9/11 in New York City influenced residential preferences in New York State. Our results confirm that perceived risks are greatest downstate but exert little overall net effect on (re)location plans. A stabilizing effect may be evident where preferences are reinforced among upstate residents who respond to downstate risk by strengthening ``stay put'' attitudes. An inspection of real-estate data in the northern reaches of the New York Metropolitan Area suggests a risk-averse hedging strategy-city residents relocating in stages by acquiring open land and the option to build and move should renewed terrorist attacks occur.	3	David Kay; Charles Geisler; Nelson Bills
Gordon, Jason, David Matarrita-Cascante, Richard Stedman & A. Luloff. 2010. 'Wildfire Perception and Community Change.' Rural Sociology. 75:3 455-477.	Rural Sociology	2010	4	P>Given increasing political and financial commitments to wildfire preparedness, risk policy demands that risk identification, assessment, and mitigation activities are balanced among diverse resident groups. Essential for this is the understanding of residents' perceptions of wildfire risks. This study compares wildfire-risk perceptions of Pennsylvania residents with those of Minnesotans living in natural-amenity-rich communities. Natural-amenity-driven migration shifts land-use patterns and social conditions, making it important to understand if and how such changes affect residents' perceptions of wildfire. Key informant interviews suggest land use and contrasting values associated with sociodemographic shifts were intertwined with wildfire-risk awareness, concern, and mitigation. In both study areas, local social interactions were impaired by geospatial and sociocultural barriers related to land use and population change. Barriers included perceived threats to quality of life, conflicting needs for economic development, and homes built in isolated locations. As a result, residents did not agree on community-wide notions of wildfire risk and response. Further, residents' ideas about the potential for a wildfire disaster did not correspond to those of risk managers. Although some places were attempting to overcome these challenges, many informants said their communities were overwhelmed with the effects of change. Finding common notions of wildfire risk is critical precisely because resident participation is crucial to hazard management. In these localities, rural community development can facilitate capacities to address wildfire risk in the context of landscape and social change.	4	Jason S.

Ghimire, Dirgha & William Axinn. 2010. 'Community Context, Land Use, and First Birth.' Rural Sociology. 75:3 478-513.	Rural Sociology	2010	4	P>This article examines the influence of community context and land use on the monthly odds of first birth in a society in the midst of dramatic fertility transition. The theoretical framework guiding our work predicts that proximity to nonfamily services should delay first births by creating opportunities for competing nonfamily activities and spreading new ideas that change expectations about family life. On the other hand, living in agricultural settings that provide opportunities for higher returns to child labor should speed first births. We use a longitudinal, multilevel, mixed-method data from the Nepalese Himalayas to test these predictions. The empirical results reveal that nonfamily services during childhood and during early adulthood both have important independent influences on the odds of first birth. Also, as predicted, a high density of agricultural land use affects the odds of first births in the opposite direction, speeding first births. This clear pattern of contrasting effects provides important new evidence of the contextual dynamics that produce watershed changes in postmarital birth timing.	2	Dirgha J. Ghimire; William G. Axinn
Toan, Tran. 2010. 'a Breath of Atheism in Religious Vietnam.' Social Compass. 57:3 311-318.	Social Compass	2010	0	Atheism is not a fundamental notion. This negative concept is relative to the object of its negation, which pre-exists: the gods, God, or rather our ideas of him. In monotheistic regimes, such as in the West, atheism is radical and often aggressive. Since its first contacts with the West, Vietnam has experienced both extremes of this situation, through Christianity and communism. In a polytheistic regime, as in traditional Vietnam, atheism is less exclusive, more tolerant and more nuanced. Appealing to certain gods implies ignorance of, indifference to or the rejection of others; it often betrays a desire to use gods as a means to serve man, who thus believes himself to be the last link in the chain. As monotheism rejects the power of the divinity of nature and of humans, its negation can inversely result in subjecting man to nature and society to the State.	1	Tran Van Toan
Willaime, Jean-Paul. 2010. 'Vietnam in the Challenge of Protestant Diversity.' Social Compass. 57:3 319-331.	Social Compass	2010	0	The Socialist Republic of Vietnam has to face up to two important challenges: on the one hand, an increasing religious pluralization of the population, marked most notably by a diversified development of Protestantism; on the other hand, a new religious policy reaching beyond the traditional Marxist disqualification of religions in favour of a controlled recognition of faiths in the framework of national patriotism. The author's aim is to clarify the extent to which Protestant diversity is a challenge for Vietnam in the age of religious globalization.	1	Jean-Paul Willaime
Tam, Ngo. 2010. 'Ethnic and Transnational Dimensions of Recent Protestant Conversion Among the Hmong in Northern Vietnam.' Social Compass. 57:3 332-344.	Social Compass	2010	0	The author argues that ethnic and transnational dimensions are crucial to an understanding of the conversion of the Hmong to Protestantism in Northern Vietnam. Although a number of scholars have proposed that the study of religion be incorporated into the study of transnationalism, the ``transnationalization'' of religion is still rather understudied, and there have been few scholarly efforts to analyze the transnational aspects of the conversions to world religions of marginalized ethnic minority groups in countries with high levels of emigration. The author examines the transnationalization of religion via the case of the Hmong conversion to show that the impact of missionization is twofold, as not only does the habitus of the Hmong in Vietnam change through massive conversion but so also does the subjectivity of the Hmong missionaries. She proposes to conceptualize the evangelical mission of the Hmong diasporas in Vietnam in particular and in Asia in general as a form of ``remittance of faith and modernity''.	1	Ngo Thi Tam
Lien, Claire. 2010. 'the Relationship Between the Catholic Church and the Vietnam State Dince Doi Moi. Perspectives.' Social Compass. 57:3 345-356.	Social Compass	2010	1	The relationship between State and Church in Vietnam differs from that in China because of the loyalty of the Vietnamese Church to Rome. As a minority religion (7\% of the population), the Catholic Church has adopted a policy of dialogue with the communist State since the reunification of the country in 1975. After a difficult initial period, the Church is now enjoying a marked revival. The reform policy (doi moi) initiated in 1986 and the opening of the country after more than 40 years of war have contributed to the improvement of State-Church relations. Committed to an international integration process, and under simultaneous pressure from Western countries, international institutions and increasing public unrest, the Vietnamese State is pursuing its policy of religious tolerance even though this policy creates tensions both within the Party and at local level.

Social Compass	2010	0	Caodaism is a Vietnamese religious movement that appeared in colonial Cochinchina in the 1920s. What are the sociological roots of Caodaism? The author attempts to answer this question through an analysis of the Caodaist networks that developed in the early 20th century in Cochinchina. Setting out some ethnographic materials concerning the Chinese Minh religions, the author focuses on only one of the five Minh religions in Vietnam, called Minh Ly (''Enlightened Reason''). He sheds new light on the esoteric roots of Caodaism, on the political regulation of the religious sphere and, finally, on the religious and political map of Southern Vietnam.	1	Jeremy Jammes
Bourdeaux, Pascal. 2010. 'Thoughts on the Institutionalization of Hoa Hao Buddhism. Renewed Historical Perspective of Knowledge in 1999.' Social Compass. 57:3 372-385.	Social Compass	2010	0	Hoa Hao Buddhism celebrated its 60th anniversary in 1999. More than a million of its followers then came to its holy place (thanh dia), the native village of its founder, Huynh Phu So. This event, one of the most important pilgrimages that Vietnam has welcomed in recent decades, proved the vitality of a religious practice that had been obliged to express itself in a strictly private and individual way for a quarter of a century. It also set the seal on the conditional legal recognition of this at once local (the Western part of the Mekong delta) and transnational (Vietnamese overseas communities) religious movement as one of the country's six established religions. This historical and historiographical review aims to emphasize the importance of collective memory and to clarify the implications of the religious regulation that, since 1999, has been redefining the institutionalization of Hoa Hoa Buddhism and the social role of its followers.	1	Pascal Bourdeaux
Bollen, Kenneth & Jennie Brand. 2010. 'a General Panel Model With Random and Fixed Effects a Structural Equations Approach.' Social Forces. 89:1 1-34.	Social Forces	2010	8	Fixed- and random-effects models for longitudinal data are common in sociology Their primary advantage is that they control for time-invariant omitted variables However, analysts face several issues when they employ these models One is the choice of which to apply, another is that FEM and REM models as usually implemented might be insufficiently flexible For example, the effects of variables, including the latent time-invariant variable, might change over time The latent time-invariant variable might correlate with some variables and not others Lagged endogenous variables might be necessary Alternatives that move beyond the classic FEM and REM models are known, but they involve estimators and software that make these extended models difficult to implement and to compare This article presents a general panel model that includes the standard FEM and REM as special cases In addition it provides a sequence of nested models that provide a richer range of models that researchers can easily compare with likelihood ratio tests and fit statistics Furthermore, researchers can implement our general panel model and its special cases in widely available structural equation models software	2	Kenneth A.

We analyze the functions of these two prototypical female victims in terms of the role they play in epitomizing ``the problems of globalization'' and in reinforcing the existing social and political structures. Victim discourse, when tied to the transnational proliferation of the sex industry and of (radical) Islam, has depoliticizing effects because it places nonindividual causes of victimization outside of ``our'' polity and society and casts the state as protector and neutral arbiter of national and global inequalities, marginalization, and social conflict.	2	Christine M.

Social Politics	2010	6	This article discusses the regulation of marriage migration to Norway through an analysis of the subsistence requirement rule which entails that a person who wants to bring a spouse to Norway must achieve a certain level of income. Policy-makers present two main arguments for this regulation. First, the subsistence requirement is a means to prevent forced marriage. Second, its aim is to prevent family immigrants from becoming a burden on welfare budgets. The major concern of both these arguments is that of dependency, either on the family or on the welfare state. The article investigates the representations of the ``problems'' underpinning this specific policy proposal and argues that the rule in question, and immigration policy more generally, needs to be analyzed with reference to the broader concerns and aims of welfare state policy and gender equality policy.	1	Helga Eggebo

Social Politics	2010	1	Adopting a transnational perspective has become essential in understanding the contemporary practices taking place across borders, especially with respect to migrants. In this article, I argue that we can distinguish two theoretical orientations within transnational migration studies: one theorizing the complexity of transnational processes and focusing on established migrants settled in host countries; and the second theorizing transnational practices on the basis of different but continuous forms of mobility. Using the example of cabaret dancers in Switzerland, I show how they develop a very specific form of transnationality, which corresponds at first sight to the second theoretical orientation. Some of them are genuinely ``world travelers''-they work in erotic clubs in Switzerland, Japan, or Lebanon, go home regularly to visit their families, or continue their studies. As such, their transnational morphology is highly influenced by gender as well as by the (transnational) nature of the sex industry and the opportunities and legal structure in Switzerland. Nevertheless, to remain in circulation, the dancers need to develop a kind of mobility capital, which involves, paradoxically, becoming ``sedentarized'' to a certain degree in Switzerland. The article thus advocates a theoretical framework that better captures the experiences of settled as well as of circulatory migrants.	1	Janine Dahinden
Booth, Karen. 2010. 'a Magic Bullet for the ``african'' Mother? Neo-imperial Reproductive Futurism and the Pharmaceutical ``solution'' to the Hiv/aids Crisis.' Social Politics. 17:3 349-378.	Social Politics	2010	0	On the basis of a close reading of popular and medical texts which address a debate over the ethics of clinical drug trials funded by the United States and designed mainly for sub-Saharan Africa, I argue that international public health discourse about infant HIV infection in that region reflects and legitimates a neo-imperialist, anti-reproductive justice ideology. Participants share a fetal-centered logic that US-funded biomedicine must shoulder the burden of rescuing sub-Saharan Africa from itself by using the bodies of HIV-positive pregnant women to transmit biomedicine's magic bullet-antiretroviral drugs-to the next generation. The survival of the fetus, disguised as the well-being of the HIV-positive woman and accomplished by the magic of biomedical research, becomes the survival of a region otherwise doomed by its present state of economic, political, and medical incapacity. This version of what queer theorist Lee Edelman (2004, No Future: Queer Theory and the Death Drive) calls ``reproductive futurism'' redounds to the benefit of the more explicitly women-hating and nationalist ideologies of still-powerful right-wing movements against reproductive and sexual rights.	1	Karen M.

By analyzing the concrete workings and uses of Europe's domestic violence policy-making in five Central and Eastern European countries, it identifies three mechanisms of Europeanization in the field and shows how together they work to expand the reach of the EU to this policy realm. The findings point toward an understanding of Europeanization based on social learning and dynamic, interactive processes of constructing what membership in the EU means in terms of domestic violence policy processes.	2	Andrea Krizsan; Raluca Popa
Corning, Amy. 2010. 'Emigration, Generation, and Collective Memories: the Presence of the Past for Emigrants From the Former Soviet Union.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 73:3 223-244.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	3	Research on memory of public events consistently reveals generational effects, where individuals remember best the events from their `'critical years'' of adolescence and early adulthood-a phenomenon attributed to privileged encoding or retrieval of memories due to primacy of experience. Prior research, however, has not decoupled the youthful period from transitional experiences more generally, raising the question of whether primacy generated by important transitions not tied to youth-such as emigration from one country to another-might also enhance memories. Survey data are used to examine effects of generation on collective memories of public events among a sample of mostly Jewish emigrants from the Soviet Union and its successor states. Evidence points to persistent generational effects, linking memory to adolescence and young adulthood specifically, rather than to primacy of transitional experiences in general. Perspectives that emphasize adolescents' agentic interpretation, construction of meaning, and decision-making suggest reasons for the link between memories and youth.	1	Amy D. Corning
Schafer, Markus & Tetyana Shippee. 2010. 'Age Identity in Context: Stress and the Subjective Side of Aging.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 73:3 245-264.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	3	The passage of time is fundamentally experienced through people's interaction with their social worlds. Life-course scholars acknowledge the multiple aspects of time-based experience but have given little attention to age identity in a dynamic context. Drawing from a stress-process model, we expected that turbulence within people's family relations and health declines would produce increases in subjective age. Family role transitions were also examined as potential factors that would hasten subjective aging, but only to the extent that they produced stress. We used the Midlife Development in the United States study, a nationally representative longitudinal survey. Regression results show that turbulence within one's family accelerated age identity and that the effect of diminishing psychosocial resources explained this relationship. For the most part, however, changes within family roles did not affect age identity. On the other hand, the incidence of chronic health problems increased subjective ages, and this relationship too was mediated by the depletion of psychosocial resources. The findings demonstrate an interconnection between the stress process and age identity. Broadening our conception of time-based experience with attention to the stress process offers exciting directions for future theory and research in life course sociology.	2	Markus H.

Butler, Carly, Jonathan Potter, Susan Danby, Michael Emmison & Alexa Hepburn. 2010. 'Advice-implicative Interrogatives: Building `'client-centered'' Support in a Children's Helpline.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 73:3 265-287.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	14	Interactional research on advice giving has described advice as normative and asymmetric. In this paper we examine how these dimensions of advice are softened by counselors on a helpline for children and young people through the use of questions. Through what we term `'advice-implicative interrogatives,'' counselors ask clients about the relevance or applicability of a possible future course of action. The allusion to this possible action by the counselor identifies it as normatively relevant, and displays the counselor's epistemic authority in relation to dealing with a client's problems. However, the interrogative format mitigates the normative and asymmetric dimensions typical of advice sequences by orienting to the client's epistemic authority in relation to their own lives, and delivering advice in a way that is contingent upon the client's accounts of their experiences, capacities, and understandings. The demonstration of the use of questions in advice sequences offers an interactional specification of the `'client-centered'' support that is characteristic of prevailing counseling practice. More specifically, it shows how the values of empowerment and child-centered practice, which underpin services such as Kids Helpline, are embodied in specific interactional devices. Detailed descriptions of this interactional practice offer fresh insights into the use of interrogatives in counseling contexts, and provide practitioners with new ways of thinking about, and discussing, their current practices.	5	Carly W.

Thebaud, Sarah. 2010. 'Gender and Entrepreneurship as a Career Choice: Do Self-assessments of Ability Matter?.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 73:3 288-304.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	3	The gender gap in entrepreneurship has typically been understood through women's structural disadvantages in acquiring the resources relevant for successful business ownership. This study builds on resource-based approaches to investigate how cultural beliefs about gender influence the process by which individuals initially come to identify entrepreneurship as a viable labor-market option. Drawing on status characteristics theory, this study evaluates (1) how cultural beliefs about gender and entrepreneurship influence self-assessments of entrepreneurial ability, and (2) the extent to which such assessments account for the gender gap in business start-ups. Results suggest that women are significantly less likely to perceive themselves as able to be an entrepreneur and they hold themselves to a stricter standard of competence when compared to similarly situated men. This gender difference in self-assessments accounts for a significant portion of the gender gap in entrepreneurship after controlling for relevant resources. Additional analyses reveal that significant gender differences in self-assessed ability persist among established business owners.	1	Sarah Thebaud

Social Science Research	2010	2	Steven Nock argued that love understood narrowly in terms of emotional and sexual intimacy-was a flimsy foundation for relationships and that the institution of marriage provided a firmer footing for stable, high-quality relationships than love alone. Relying on data from the Marriage Matters Survey of 1414 married men and women in Louisiana (1998-2004), we extended Nock's insights to consider whether contemporary marriages organized along institutional lines enjoyed more stability, satisfaction, and less conflict than marriages organized around a soulmate model. Largely consistent with Nock's perspective, we found that individuals who embraced norms of marital permanency and gender specialization and were embedded in social networks and religious institutions enjoyed high-quality stable marriages, so long as they also focused on the expressive dimension of married life. By contrast, spouses who embraced a soulmate model of marriage experienced high levels of satisfaction but also experienced high levels of conflict and divorce. Finally, spouses who embraced traditional norms about marriage without the benefit of social support for those norms reported low levels of marital quality.	2	W. Bradford Wilcox; Jeffrey Dew

Social Science Research. 39:5, SI 700-714.	Social Science Research	2010	0	We examine relationships between childhood abuse and two maladaptive marital communication patterns - hostile and withdrawing - and test whether covenant marriage or pre-marital counseling mediate the effects of childhood abuse. Drawing on a sample from the Marriage Matters (1997-2004) data, we find both gendered differences in communication and in the relationship between childhood abuse and negative communication patterns. Wives are more likely to use a hostile style of communication, whereas husbands are more likely to use a withdrawing style. We also find that childhood abuse affects hostile communication for both spouses but influences only wives' withdrawing. Neither covenant marriage nor pre-marital counseling is associated with hostile communication for either spouse. Covenant marriage increases husbands' withdrawal from conflict, whereas pre-marital counseling increases the use of withdrawing communication in both wives and husbands.	4	Kristy M.

Dzara, Kristina. 2010. 'Assessing the Effect of Marital Sexuality on Marital Disruption.' Social Science Research. 39:5, SI 715-724.	Social Science Research	2010	1	Little is known about how marital sexual interaction influences eventual marital disruption, despite research in various disciplines examining the sex lives of the married. This relatively unexplored area compels sociological inquiry, since most Americans will marry, yet nearly half of all American marriages are expected to end in divorce. Surprisingly, no one has posed the question: does frequent, satisfying, and/or agreeable marital sexual interaction early in marriage help to sustain a marriage? With panel data from the Marriage Matters Panel Survey of Newlywed Couples, 1998-2004, I utilize these three indicators (frequency, satisfaction, and agreement) to assess this question. The results provide evidence that the influence of marital sexuality on marital disruption is limited. However, interesting gender nuances appear and indicate that husband's satisfaction with physical intimacy early in marriage has a consistent positive effect on whether or not the couple will experience a marital disruption.	1	Kristina Dzara
Yucel, Deniz & Margaret Gassanov. 2010. 'Exploring Actor and Partner Correlates of Sexual Satisfaction Among Married Couples.' Social Science Research. 39:5, SI 725-738.	Social Science Research	2010	6	Using the Interpersonal Exchange Model of Sexual Satisfaction, we consider how infidelity, pornography consumption, marital satisfaction, sexual frequency, premarital sex, and cohabitation are associated with married couples' sexual satisfaction. Data from 433 couples are analyzed with structural equation models to determine the contributions of (a) each respondent's predictors (actor effects) and (b) his/her spouse's predictors (partner effects). No gender differences in actor and partner effects emerge. Marital satisfaction and sexual frequency act as rewards and increase sexual satisfaction. A partner effect emerges for marital infidelity, suggesting that a spouse's infidelity is costly for sexual satisfaction. Finally, some evidence suggests that pornography consumption is costly for own and spouse's sexual satisfaction, especially when pornography is used by only one spouse.	2	Deniz Yucel; Margaret A.

Paik, Anthony. 2010. '``hookups,'' Dating, and Relationship Quality: Does the Type of Sexual Involvement Matter?.' Social Science Research. 39:5, SI 739-753.	Social Science Research	2010	2	Are partnerships that begin as ``hookups,'' ``friends with benefits,'' or casual dating relationships less satisfying and rewarding than serious sexual involvements? This research tests whether selection, experience, or mediation processes affect associations between types of sexual involvement and relationship quality. Drawing on a sample of 642 urban adults, we estimated ordinary least squares and treatment-effects regressions examining associations among types of sexual involvement, joint investments, and relationship quality. The results indicated that sexual involvements in nonromantic and casual dating contexts were associated with lower relationship quality in comparison to serious contexts, but these effects were completely accounted for by selectivity. Controlling for joint investments did not mediate these selection effects. The findings support the notion that screening processes associated with sexual involvement have important implications for later relationship quality.	1	Anthony Paik
Lichter, Daniel, Richard Turner & Sharon Sassler. 2010. 'National Estimates of the Rise in Serial Cohabitation.' Social Science Research. 39:5, SI 754-765.	Social Science Research	2010	13	This paper provides new estimates of changing patterns of serial cohabitation, using data from the 1995 and 2002 National Survey of Family Growth. Serial cohabitation is defined as having multiple premarital cohabiting relationships. Analyses indicate that rates of serial cohabitation increased by nearly 40 percent over the late 1990s and early 2000s, and rates were especially high among young adults and recent marriage cohorts. A large majority of women - 75 percent - nevertheless lived only with men they eventually married. Although rates of serial cohabitation are higher among never-married women than ever-married women, there is little indication that single women - even older single women - have embraced serial cohabitation as an alternative to marriage or even as an intensive kind of dating. The results show that serial cohabitation is heavily concentrated among disadvantaged populations (e.g., women who grew up in single parent families). Early sexual activity and teen childbearing are especially important ``risk'' factors for serial cohabitation in the never-married population. There is little evidence, however, that recent shifts in the sociodemographic risk profile of the US population have been responsible for observed increases in single-instance or serial cohabitation. Increases in serial cohabitation have been broadly experienced across population groups in America.	3	Daniel T. Lichter; Richard N. Turner; Sharon Sassler

Social Science Research	2010	6	Even though serial cohabitation is on the rise, it has not been integrated into recent family research. We analyze the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) cycle 6 to explore the relationship context of serial cohabitation for women throughout emerging adulthood (N = 3397). We provide a relationship context for serial cohabitation by examining the age at first cohabitation, duration of cohabiting unions, marital expectations and transitions, as well as premarital sexual histories. Furthermore, we examine the change in these relationship indicators across women's birth cohorts. We find that serial cohabitors' co-residential unions are about the same duration as single-instance cohabiting unions. Serial cohabitors start cohabiting younger, report lower marital expectations than single-instance cohabitors and a smaller proportion marry before age 30. Women who have more premarital sex partners have significantly greater odds of serial cohabiting. These findings indicate that women face increasingly complex relationship trajectories during emerging adulthood.	2	Jessica Cohen; Wendy Manning
Brown, Susan & Sayaka Kawamura. 2010. 'Relationship Quality Among Cohabitors and Marrieds in Older Adulthood.' Social Science Research. 39:5, SI 777-786.	Social Science Research	2010	9	The rapid growth in cohabitation in recent decades has coincided with a burgeoning literature on the topic. Yet despite a sustained increase in cohabitation among middle-aged and older adults, this group has received little research attention. Close relationships are integral to well-being and the quality of these relationships has consequences for health, especially among older adults. We use data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP), a nationally representative sample of 3005 people ages 57-85 to compare the relationship quality of older cohabitors versus marrieds. The two groups are remarkably similar. Cohabitors and marrieds do not significantly differ in their reports of emotional satisfaction, pleasure, openness, time spent together, criticism, and demands. Cohabitors are less likely than marrieds to report that their relationship is very happy. There is some evidence of gender by union type differences. Cohabiting unions among older adults tend to be of relatively long duration. Overall, these results indicate that cohabitation may operate as an alternative to marriage for older adults.	2	Susan L.

Glenn, Norval, Jeremy Uecker & Robert Love. 2010. 'Later First Marriage and Marital Success.' Social Science Research. 39:5, SI 787-800.	Social Science Research	2010	6	The research reported here used measures of marital success based on both marital survival and marital quality to assess how well first marriages entered at relatively late ages fare in comparison with those entered younger. Analysis of data from five American data sets indicated that the later marriages fare very well in survival but rather poorly in quality. The greatest indicated likelihood of being in an intact marriage of the highest quality is among those who married at ages 22-25, net of the estimated effects of time since first marriage and several variables that might commonly affect age at marriage and marital outcomes. The negative relationship beyond the early to mid-twenties between age at marriage and marital success is likely to be at least partially spurious, and thus it would be premature to conclude that the optimal time for first marriage for most persons is ages 22-25. However, the findings do suggest that most persons have little or nothing to gain in the way of marital success by deliberately postponing marriage beyond the mid-twenties.	3	Norval D.

Springer, Kristen. 2010. 'Do Wives' Work Hours Hurt Husbands' Health? Reassessing the Care Work Deficit Thesis.' Social Science Research. 39:5, SI 801-813.	Social Science Research	2010	0	Prior research suggests that wives' full-time employment harms husbands' health because employed wives have less time to promote their husbands' salubrious behavior (''care work deficit thesis'' (CWDT)). In this manuscript. I analyze couple-level, longitudinal Health and Retirement Study data to assess whether evidence for the CWDT is robust to an array of sensitivity tests and correction of limitations from prior research. Specifically, I account for methodological/measurement limitations (i.e. proxy reporting), causal ordering/selection concerns (i.e. retirement and reverse causation), and conceptual issues (i.e. wives' income vs. wives' hours affecting husbands' health). The results provide strong and repeated evidence that prior support for the CWDT is due to conceptual and model mis-specification. In other words, the results indicate that wives' full-time work hours do not harm husbands' health. However, further analyses suggest that wives' and husbands' income may differently affect husbands' health, underscoring the need for gendered analyses of income and health within marriage.	1	Kristen W.

Musick, Kelly & Ann Meier. 2010. 'Are Both Parents Always Better Than One? Parental Conflict and Young Adult Well-being.' Social Science Research. 39:5, SI 814-830.	Social Science Research	2010	6	Using data from three waves of the National Survey of Families and Households (N = 1963), we examine associations between adolescent family experiences and young adult wellbeing across a range of indicators, including schooling, substance use, and family-related transitions. We compare children living with both biological parents, but whose parents differ in how often they argue, to children in stepfather and single-mother families, and we assess the extent to which differences can be understood in terms of family income and parenting practices. Findings suggest that parental conflict is associated with children's poorer academic achievement, increased substance use, and early family formation and dissolution. Living in single-mother and stepfather families tend to be more strongly associated with our indicators of well-being, although differences between these family types and living with high conflict continuously married parents are often statistically indistinguishable. Income and parenting largely do not account for associations between adolescent family type and later life outcomes. We conclude that while children do better, on average, living with two biological married parents, the advantages of two-parent families kare not shared equally by all.	2	Kelly Musick; Ann Meier
Sassler, Sharon, Fenaba Addo & Elizabeth Hartmann. 2010. 'the Tempo of Relationship Progression Among Low-income Couples.' Social Science Research. 39:5, SI 831-844.	Social Science Research	2010	3	This paper examines the factors associated with the tempo of low-income couples relationship progression into sexual involvement and coresidence. Data come from a recently-collected survey, the Marital and Relationship Survey (MARS) that obtained information from low- to moderate-income married and cohabiting couples. Over one-fifth of male and female respondents reported becoming sexually involved with their current partner within the first week of dating. Entrance into shared living was also quite rapid; about one-third of respondents moved in with their partner within 6 months. Furthermore, about two-thirds of married respondents initially cohabited with their partners. Indicators of family disadvantage accelerated entrance into sexual involvement and coresidence; these effects are more pronounced for women than men. Our results also suggest that the pace of relationship progression, into sexual involvement as well as shared living, has accelerated among unions formed more recently.	3	Sharon Sassler; Fenaba Addo; Elizabeth Hartmann
Kalmijn, Matthijs. 2010. 'Racial Differences in the Effects of Parental Divorce and Separation on Children: Generalizing the Evidence to a European Case.' Social Science Research. 39:5, SI 845-856.	Social Science Research	2010	0	Much American research has shown that the effects of parental divorce and single parenthood on children are weaker among African Americans than among whites. So far, this moderator effect has not been studied in other societies. Are there also weaker effects of parental divorce and single parenthood for blacks in other countries? We answer this question by analyzing Caribbeans in the Netherlands. We analyze effects of parental divorce and separation on eight outcome indicators for children in adulthood and we compare these effects between Caribbeans and whites. We show that for Caribbeans there are no effects of parental divorce on own divorce, cohabitation, leaving home, and contact frequency with the father, much in contrast to the effects for whites. For socioeconomic outcomes, however, the effects are similar for Caribbeans and whites.	1	Matthijs Kalmijn

Sociological Forum. 25:3 401-427.	Sociological Forum	2010	7	Fifty years ago, the main challenges to large infrastructure projects were technical or scientific. Today, the greatest hurdles faced by such projects are almost always social and/or political. Whether constructing large dams in the developing world or siting liquefied natural gas terminals in the United States, the onset of these projects often triggers intense popular opposition. But not always, and therein lays the animating aim of this project. We undertake a systematic comparative case analysis of mobilization efforts against 11 oil and gas pipeline projects spanning 16 countries in the developing world. Using theories from the social movement and facility siting literatures and the technique of fuzzy set/qualitative comparative analysis (fs/QCA), we examine the ``causal conditions'' linked to political and legal opposition to these projects. We find that both Western funding of projects and public consultation serve as necessary political opportunities encouraging mobilization. In addition, not compensating the host country for involvement in the project is linked to mobilization. Finally, some risk from the project, in the form of environmental or social impact, is associated with mobilization; however, this impact does not have to be very significant for mobilization to occur.	6	Doug McAdam; Hilary Schaffer Boudet; Jennifer Davis; Ryan J.

Fong, Eric, Xingshan Cao & Elic Chan. 2010. 'Out of Sight, Out of Mind? Patterns of Transnational Contact Among Chinese and Indian Immigrants in Toronto1.' Sociological Forum. 25:3 428-449.	Sociological Forum	2010	2	There has been considerable discussion in recent decades about the integration patterns of new immigrants. Recognizing advancements in technology and the increased economic integration of countries, some researchers have suggested that the emerging integration trend for immigrants is the transnational pattern, whereby immigrants maintain contact with the home countries. To advance the discussion, this study focuses on general transnational contact, a basic form of transnational activity. The study draws from recently collected large-scale survey data to explore the patterns of transnational contact within two recent immigrant groups, Asian Indians and Chinese, in Toronto. Our findings show that only a small percentage of immigrants maintain intensive and extensive transnational contact. As well, our findings are less consistent with the transnational perspective than with the assimilation perspective on the effects of socioeconomic background on transnational contacts.	3	Eric Fong; Xingshan Cao; Elic Chan
Cherry, Elizabeth. 2010. 'Shifting Symbolic Boundaries: Cultural Strategies of the Animal Rights Movement1.' Sociological Forum. 25:3 450-475.	Sociological Forum	2010	1	How do activists create cultural change? Scholars have investigated the development and maintenance of collective identities as one avenue for cultural change, but to understand how activists foster change beyond their own movements, we need to look at activists' strategies for changing their targets' mindsets and actions. Sociologists need to look at activists' boundary work to understand both the wide-sweeping goals and strategies that activists enact to generate broad-based cultural changes. Using data from participant observation and interviews with animal rights activists in France and the United States, and drawing on research on ethnic boundary shifting, I show how activists used two main strategies to shift symbolic boundaries between humans and animals, as well as between companion and farm animals-(1) they blur boundaries through focusing and universalizing strategies and (2) they cross boundaries physically, discursively, and iconographically. This study contributes a new theoretical and empirical example to the cultural changes studied by scholars of social movements, and it also provides a useful counterpoint to studies of symbolic boundary construction and maintenance in the sociology of culture.	1	Elizabeth Cherry
Springer, Kristen. 2010. 'the Race and Class Privilege of Motherhood: Thenew York Times Presentations of Pregnant Drug-using Women1.' Sociological Forum. 25:3 476-499.	Sociological Forum	2010	0	Prior research has examined race and class bias embedded in media presentations of pregnant drug users; however, this past research is limited in identifying biases because it focuses on single substances-primarily crack cocaine. I build on this work by conducting a comparative analysis of more than 15 years worth of New York Times articles on three drugs (crack cocaine, alcohol, and tobacco) used during pregnancy. These three drugs have varying levels of deleterious effects on fetal development and infant health, as well as varying levels of use by poor and minority women. Because of this variation, I am able to assess whether media coverage of pregnant drug-using women is proportional to the documented adverse consequences of specific drugs or, rather, whether media coverage is higher and more negative for poor and minority pregnant women regardless of the degree of adverse health consequences associated with the specific drug used. Through this analysis, I demonstrate that the prevalence and framing of news stories about pregnant drug-using women has little to do with protecting the health of children. Rather, concern for children is a rhetorical tool used to define poor and minority women as bad mothers and blame them for contemporary changes in families.	1	Kristen W. Springer
Eckstein, Rick, Dana Moss & Kevin Delaney. 2010. 'Sports Sociology's Still Untapped Potential.' Sociological Forum. 25:3 500-518.	Sociological Forum	2010	0	Following up on Zirin's (2008)challenge that sports sociologists ``get off the bench,'' and Karen and Washington's (2001) plea to make sports sociology more central to analyses of social power, this article empirically reviews and assesses the sociology of sports from 1977-2008. Using a sample of 441 articles selected from the three major sports sociology journals during that period, we conclude that sports sociology exhibits a strong and increasing bias toward micro-level analyses of (for example) how the content of sports frames and constructs the social world. A smaller and shrinking body of work examines more macro-oriented issues such as the economics and politics of sports, and there seem to be few attempts to meaningfully synthesize these micro and macro orientations. We think this partiality toward micro-oriented frameworks is rooted in factors unique to sports sociology while also reflecting larger trends within sociology as a whole. As advocates of popularly accessible public sociology, we respectfully suggest that sports sociologists try harder to weave macro analyses into their work, not necessarily replacing micro-level approaches, but complementing them. We believe that sports sociology is well-positioned to become a standard bearer for public sociology, but only if it pays more attention to the way organized sports intertwines with the organizational, political, and economic forces that perpetuate and exacerbate social inequality.	3	Rick Eckstein; Dana M.

DeGloma, Thomas. 2010. 'Awakenings: Autobiography, Memory, and the Social Logic of Personal Discovery.' Sociological Forum. 25:3 519-540.	Sociological Forum	2010	7	Taking a formal, sociocognitive approach to narrative analysis, I explore autobiographical stories about discovering ``truth'' in political, psychological, religious, and sexual realms of social life. Despite (1) significant differences in subject matter and (2) conflicting or oppositional notions of truth, individuals in different social environments tell stories that follow the same awakening formula. Analyzing accounts from a wide variety of social and historical contexts, I show how individuals and communities use these autobiographical stories to define salient moral and political concerns and weigh in on cultural and epistemic disputes. Awakening narratives are important mechanisms of mnemonic and autobiographical revision that individuals use to redefine their past experiences and relationships and plot future courses of action while explaining major transformations of worldview. Awakeners use two ideal-typical vocabularies of liminality to justify traversing the social divide between contentious autobiographical communities. Further, awakeners divide their lives into discrete autobiographical periods and convey a figurative interaction between the split personas of a temporally divided self. Individuals use this autobiographical formula to reject the cognitive and mnemonic norms of one community and embrace those of another. Advancing a ``social geometry'' of awakening narratives, I illuminate the social logic behind our seemingly personal discoveries of ``truth.''	1	Thomas DeGloma
Murphy, Alexandra. 2010. 'the Symbolic Dilemmas of Suburban Poverty: Challenges and Opportunities Posed by Variations in the Contours of Suburban Poverty1.' Sociological Forum. 25:3 541-569.	Sociological Forum	2010	3	Poverty has increased significantly in U.S. suburbs since the 1990s. What we know about suburban poverty is largely limited to demographic and economic information. Building off the organizational perspective approach, I use in-depth interviews with nonprofit, antipoverty organizations in eight Pennsylvania suburbs to better understand the suburban poverty experience. My focus is on how organizations compete for external resources. By working directly with the poverty problem while also working in broader metropolitan political and economic fields of decision making, this ``middleman'' role (Marwell, 2007) gives us insights into contemporary poverty dynamics for suburbs. I find that how suburban organizational leaders perceive the challenges they face, and what strategies they adopt to confront such difficulties, revolves around symbolic dilemmas posed by the history, distribution, and politics of poverty in the suburbs. Symbolic dilemmas cluster around three different situational contexts of poverty in the suburbs. I use this to develop a three-part typology of suburban poverty: symbiotic suburbs, skeletal suburbs, and overshadowed suburbs. This typology has implications for future research and for policymakers interested in developing tools to appropriately address this pressing issue.	1	Alexandra K. Murphy
Rotolo, Thomas, John Wilson & Mary Hughes. 2010. 'Homeownership and Volunteering: an Alternative Approach to Studying Social Inequality and Civic Engagement1.' Sociological Forum. 25:3 570-587.	Sociological Forum	2010	5	Previous research on volunteering finds significant differences by race and social class. We augment these findings by examining a largely ignored measure of social class: tenure status, the distinction between renters and homeowners. We test a theory that predicts people volunteer more if they have a ``stake'' in their community and we use the value of their home as a measure of the size of this stake, with renters having no stake at all, using data from the 2003 Panel Study of Income Dynamics. We find that although homeowners volunteer more than renters, the value of their home has no influence on their volunteer work. Length of residence in the neighborhood has a positive effect on volunteerism. Tenure status partially mediates the influence of race and family income on volunteering but not education.	3	Thomas Rotolo; John Wilson; Mary Elizabeth Hughes
Lindemann, Danielle. 2010. 'Will the Real Dominatrix Please Stand Up: Artistic Purity and Professionalism in the S\&m Dungeon1.' Sociological Forum. 25:3 588-606.	Sociological Forum	2010	1	Professional dominatrices (pro-dommes) are a group that has received little sociological attention. I use Pierre Bourdieu's claims about art as a tool for illuminating important tensions within this corner of social life, where I find evidence of an embattled purity regime that has implications beyond the walls of the dominatrix's ``dungeon.'' In particular, I argue that pro-dommes' discourse resonates with Bourdieu's description of the ``anti-'economic' economy of pure art,'' employed by relatively autonomous avant-garde artists who disavow economic criteria for success as a means to legitimate themselves and symbolically distance themselves from the commercial end of the art world. Using this theory as a structural analogy for pro-domme/client relationships sheds light on claims to professionalism and the microdynamics of control within service-industry interactions more generally.	1	Danielle Lindemann
Botchkovar, Ekaterina & Lorine Hughes. 2010. 'Strain and Alcohol Use in Russia: a Gendered Analysis.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:3 297-319.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	3	Data from a random sample of 327 adults in Nizhni Novgorod, Russia, are used to test hypotheses derived from general strain theory concerning the effect of strain on frequency of alcohol use among men and women. The findings lend mixed support to the theory. Although women reported relatively high levels of strain, strained females tended to use alcohol to cope only when in a close relationship with someone who abused alcohol regularly. At the same time, strain was associated with a significant increase in alcohol coping among men, regardless of peer relations. However, for both genders, alcohol-condoning beliefs consistently outperformed strain as a predictor of drinking behavior. No evidence was found of conditional relations involving legitimate coping strategies or deviant beliefs. Contextual and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed.	2	Ekaterina V.

Cheung, Nicole & Yuet Cheung. 2010. 'Strain, Self-control, and Gender Differences in Delinquency Among Chinese Adolescents: Extending General Strain Theory.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:3 321-345.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	4	Agnew's general strain theory (GST) and Gottfredson and Hirschi's self-control theory represent significant theoretical developments in sociology of deviance over the last two decades. Both theories offer unique insights into the well-known controversy of gender disparity in crime and delinquency. Incorporating their ideas and testing them in a Chinese context, this study investigates the role of self-control, which has been seldom included in GST assessments, in moderating the strain-delinquency relationship and analyzes whether this conditioning effect varies by gender. Using data from 1,015 Chinese students in Hong Kong, negative binominal regression models found that self-control is a gender-specific conditioning factor of strain. Self-control mitigates the effects of certain strains on delinquency for females only. Yet, unexpectedly, coercive parenting decreases male delinquency and moderates the impact of low self-control in males. The implications of Chinese cultural forces for the perception of strain and the conditioning influence of self-control merit closer attention.	2	Nicole Wai Cheung; Yuet W. Cheung
MacLean, Alair & Nicholas Parsons. 2010. 'Unequal Risk: Combat Occupations in the Volunteer Military.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:3 347-372.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	0	This study evaluates the characteristics of the men who served in the volunteer military in combat occupations. It examines whether these characteristics stem from supply-side or demand-side decisions, or reflect class bias. The findings suggest that, on the supply side, men who had greater academic abilities were more likely to go to college, thereby avoiding military service and the possibility of serving in a combat occupation. On the demand side, the armed forces were more likely to exclude men with lower academic abilities but were more likely to assign such men in the military to combat occupations. Net of the impacts of these supply-side and demand-side decisions, men who served in combat occupations still differed from those who did not in terms of their family background. The impact of family background was stronger on entering the military than on being assigned to combat occupations once in the military.	2	Alair MacLean; Nicholas L. Parsons

Sociological Perspectives	2010	1	Over the last decade, neoliberal welfare policies expanded nonprofit organizations' role in the welfare state. This change resulted in the organizational emergence of numerous ``welfare internships'' (i.e., situations where welfare recipients engage in work experiences to fulfill work requirements for little or no pay), whose existence and impacts have been understudied. Using qualitative interviews with nonprofit directors, this article explores the bureaucratic face of neoliberal welfare policies through detailing how two types of welfare internships (''intermediary internships'' and ``client internships'') develop, the motivations behind them, and the problems they present. This article examines the relevance of these impacts for the welfare-to-work and nonstandard employment literatures and describes potential implications for policymakers.	1	Rebecca Joyce Kissane
Boyd, Robert. 2010. 'Black Retail Enterprise and Racial Segregation in Northern Cities Before the ``ghetto''.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:3 397-417.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	1	Past research indicates that black entrepreneurship in northern cities was unaffected by residential segregation by race until after the formation of the ``ghetto.'' In the present study, however, an analysis of Census data shows that in the urban North during the late nineteenth century, the residential segregation of blacks was positively associated with blacks' shopkeeping ratio, a measure of the extent to which black retail entrepreneurs were merchants rather than peddlers. This finding accords with the theory that ethnic businesses are often supported by the residential segregation of group members. Moreover, it implies that black merchants in northern cities may have been bolstered by business ownership opportunities created by a socially and spatially segregated market of black consumers much earlier than previously believed.	1	Robert L.

Abrutyn, Seth & Kirk Lawrence. 2010. 'From Chiefdom to State: Toward an Integrative Theory of the Evolution of Polity.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:3 419-442.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	2	The evolution of the polity, particularly the transition of chiefdoms to states, has been the subject of considerable debate. In this article, the authors engage the discussion surrounding the meta-theoretical positions on the tempo of change, specifically whether states emerged gradually from quantitative changes in chiefdom societies-gradualism-or if their appearance was the result of punctuated and qualitative change-punctuated equilibrium. After revisiting the classic debate, the authors update it with new contributions drawn from the natural and social sciences. They contend that chiefdoms do not simply become states as a result of increases in the size of component parts; instead, punctuated equilibrium, stemming from responses to selection pressures from social forces, has more empirical support than gradualism in explaining state formation. The authors then take steps toward an integrative model of polity evolution, in which the state emerges as a discrete change resulting from social forces reaching critical thresholds.	2	Seth Abrutyn; Kirk Lawrence

Sociological Perspectives	2010	2	A frequent concern voiced by social commentators has been the persistence of mass disengagement over the past two decades-despite evidence of improving democratic involvement. In particular, since 1988, voter turnout in presidential elections has dramatically rebounded, to the point that they now rival the turnout rates of the 1960s. Yet little is known about the cause of this trend. The primary theoretical focus of the following study is to examine what factors were behind this increase in turnout, paying particular attention to the electoral relevance of increasing party polarization. Results indicate that the rise in polarization was a central driver behind the turnout boom. Changes in the electoral environment account for almost 80 percent of the total increase in voter turnout. The analysis suggests that party polarization represents a key mechanism that links citizens to the larger political process. Implications for the current state of mass engagement generally and political behavior specifically are discussed.	1	Kyle Dodson

Sociological Quarterly	2010	1	Applying Weber's theorizing on action and stratification, this study examines whether the early 20th-century extinction of half of the medical schools in the United States resulted from actions intended to serve class, status, and party interests by achieving social closure. Analyses reveal closure intentions in the school ratings assigned by the American Medical Association, although not in the recommendations in the 1910 Carnegie-sponsored Flexner report. In contrast to claims that schools failed largely because of economic exigencies, analyses indicate that failures were influenced by the AMA's and Flexner's assessments, as well as by state regulatory regimes and school characteristics.	2	Richard M.

This study argues that in the paradigmatic communist revolutions of the 20th century, such as the Russian and Chinese Revolutions, the role of the exogenous factor of war was paramount. After outlining a war-centered framework for studying communist revolutions, this research shows how the devastating experience of total war against Japan (1937-1945) undermined the Kuomintang state in China and created structural conditions for the communist takeover.	1	Pavel Osinsky

However, research examining the segregation-crime relationship has focused almost exclusively on blacks and whites while largely ignoring Latinos and other race/ethnic groups and has rarely considered potential mediators (e.g., concentrated disadvantage) in segregation-violence relationships. This study uses year 2000 arrest data for California and New York census places to extend segregation-crime research by comparing the effects of racial/ethnic residential segregation from whites on black and Latino homicide. Results indicate that (1) racial/ethnic segregation contributes to both Latino and black homicide, and (2) the effects for both groups are mediated by concentrated disadvantage. Implications for segregation-violence relationships, the racial-invariance position, and the Latino paradox are discussed.	1	Ben Feldmeyer

Sociological Quarterly	2010	3	Sociological research emphasizes that personal networks offer social resources in times of need and that this capacity varies by the social position of those involved. Yet rarely are sociologists able to make direct comparisons of such inequalities. This study overcomes this methodological challenge by examining network activation among residents of two unequal neighborhoods severely devastated by Hurricane Katrina. Results indicate that local network capacities of Lower Ninth Ward residents relative to those of the more affluent Lakeview neighborhood dissipated before, during, and after the disaster to erode the life chances of individual residents and the neighborhood they once constituted.	3	James R.

Using data on Political Action Committee (PAC) contributors and roll call voting in eight U.S. Houses, 1991-2006, I approach the issue using a novel, sociological approach that focuses on social ties between lawmakers and mutually shared contributors. The findings show consistent, statistically significant contributor influence via these ties in seven of the eight Houses. I discuss the implications of these findings for contributor-lawmaker reciprocal exchange, the social embeddedness of policymaking, and political power.	1	Clayton D. Peoples

Using six years of federal administrative data, I advance previous welfare research by providing a nationally representative analysis of participant-, county-, and state-level predictors of welfare sanctioning. Using theories of racial classification, racialized social systems, and racial threat as guiding frameworks, I find that black and Latina women are at a greater risk of being sanctioned than white women. Further, although odds of a sanction are slightly reduced for black women living in counties with greater percentages of blacks, the opposite holds for Latinas, who are at an increased risk of being sanctioned in counties with greater percentages of Latinos.	1	Shannon M.

Sociological Theory	2010	4	Sociologists are fond of game metaphors. However, such metaphors rarely go beyond casual references to generic games. Yet games are little social systems, and each game offers a distinctive perspective on the relationship between rules and constraints, on the one side, and emergent order, on the other. In this article, we examine three games-chess, go, and (Texas hold `em) poker-for sociological insights into contested social arenas such as markets, warfare, politics, and the professions. We describe each game's rules and emergent properties, and then offer a brief theorization of the social world through the ``lens'' of that game. Then we show how a study of the three games advances the sociology of strategy by enriching ideas about skill, position, and strategic dilemma.	2	Benjamin DiCicco-Bloom; David R. Gibson
Archer, Margaret. 2010. 'Routine, Reflexivity, and Realism.' Sociological Theory. 28:3 272-303.	Sociological Theory	2010	14	Many scholars continue to accord routine action a central role in social theory and defend the continuing relevance of Bourdieu's habitus. Simultaneously, most recognize the importance of reflexivity. In this article, I consider three versions of the effort to render these concepts compatible, which I term ``empirical combination,'' ``hybridization,'' and ``ontological and theoretical reconciliation.'' None of the efforts is ultimately successful in analytical terms. Moreover, I argue on empirical grounds that the relevance of habitus began to decrease toward the end of the 20th century, given major changes in the structures of the advanced capitalist democracies. In these circumstances, habitual forms prove incapable of providing guidelines for people's lives and, thus, make reflexivity imperative. I conclude by arguing that even the reproduction of natal background is a reflexive activity today and that the mode most favorable to producing it-what I call ``communicative reflexivity''-is becoming harder to sustain.	1	Margaret S.

Bush, Evelyn. 2010. 'Explaining Religious Market Failure: a Gendered Critique of the Religious Economies Model.' Sociological Theory. 28:3 304-325.	Sociological Theory	2010	2	According to the religious economies model, religious supply in open religious economies should adapt to the demands of diverse market niches. This proposition is inconsistent with the finding that, although women constitute the majority of religious consumers, the majority of the religions produced in the American religious marketplace favor men's interests relative to women's. Three modifications to the religious economies model are suggested to account for this contradiction. The first modification is a respecification of ``religious capital'' that takes into account unequal distributions of power among producers of religious value and their differential effects on the beneficiaries and targets of religious norms. The second modification theorizes religion's linkages to other social institutions as sources of cost and benefit that are taken into account by religious entrepreneurs. The third modification accounts for status-based discrimination and unequal distributions of capital as sources of constraint that influence the production of religious supply. Several directions for future research are proposed.	1	Evelyn Bush
Garcelon, Marc. 2010. 'the Missing Key: Institutions, Networks, and the Project of Neoclassical Sociology.' Sociological Theory. 28:3 326-353.	Sociological Theory	2010	0	The diversity of contemporary ``capitalisms'' underscores the need to supplant the amorphous concept of structure with more precise concepts, particularly institutions and networks. All institutions entail both embodied and relational aspects. Institutions are relational insofar as they map obligatory patterns of ``getting by and getting along''-institutional orders-that steer stable social fields over time. Institutions are simultaneously embodied as institutional paradigms, part of a larger bodily agency Pierre Bourdieu called habitus. Institutions are in turn tightly coupled to networks between various people based on, but not reducible to, strategic interests. Yet social interaction sometimes exceeds institutional boundaries, giving rise to disjunctive fields and underscoring the prominence of institutional failures in the unfolding of antagonistic relations such as warfare. Such disjunctive fields can be tracked in relation to some transnational networks at the global level without assuming developmental convergence. This last point underscores the meaning of neoclassical sociology, which eschews assumptions of developmental convergence at the global level.	1	Marc Garcelon

Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:6 827-842.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	6	Gendered power imbalances in heterosexual relationships are a key target of gender-sensitive STI risk reduction interventions. Gendered aspects of sexual behaviour have not been explored among Canadian indigenous young people, who are at elevated risk for STI relative to other young Canadians. We used data from in-depth qualitative interviews with 15 male and 15 female indigenous young people to explore gendered sexual behaviour and its implications for STI reduction. There was a pervasive `double standard' where young men were expected to be sexually aggressive and young women were expected to resist sexual advances; but we also observed `alternative' or non-hegemonic behaviours. Specifically, young women were often very active participants in sexual negotiations, could refuse condom use and sometimes pressured their male partners to not use condoms. Young men also described being the object of coerced sex, and did not always perceive female sexual desire in negative terms, and were not always receptive to sex. The gendered sexual attitudes and behaviours in our sample were much more complex than usually described in the literature. Intervention work needs to take more realistic account of the sexual interactions that occur between young people.	2	Karen M. Devries; Caroline Free
Todorova, Irina, Luis Falcon, Alisa Lincoln & Lori Price. 2010. 'Perceived Discrimination, Psychological Distress and Health.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:6 843-861.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	13	Racism and discrimination can have significant implications for health, through complex biopsychosocial interactions. Latino groups, and particularly Puerto Ricans, are an understudied population in the United States in terms of the prevalence of discrimination and its relevance to health. Participants in our study were 45- to 75-year-old (N = 1122) Puerto Ricans. The measures were perceived discrimination, depressive symptomatology (CES-D), perceived stress (PSS), self-rated health, medical conditions, blood pressure, smoking and drinking behaviours, demographics. Our findings show that 36.9 per cent of participants had at some time experienced discrimination, with men, those with more years of education, currently employed and with higher incomes being more likely to report it. Experiences of discrimination were associated with increased levels of depressive symptoms and perceived stress. When controlling for covariates, perceived discrimination was predictive of the number of medical conditions, of ever having smoked and having been a drinker, and having higher values of diastolic pressure. Depressive symptoms are a mediator of the effect of perceived discrimination on medical conditions, confirmed by the Sobel test: z = 3.57, p < 0.001. Mediating roles of perceived stress, smoking and drinking behaviours were not confirmed. Increased depressive symptoms might be the main pathway through which perceived discrimination is associated with a greater number of medical diagnoses.	4	Irina L. Todorova; Luis M. Falcon; Alisa K.

Lorenz, Laura. 2010. 'Discovering a New Identity After Brain Injury.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:6 862-879.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	3	Acquired brain injury (ABI) is one example of the chronic conditions that people of varying socioeconomic status must bear. Concerns with identity and self are endemic to surviving brain injury. For this study, a brain tumour survivor injured 17 years earlier, took photographs of her life with brain injury and discussed them with other brain injury survivors and the author. Narrative analysis methods were used to analyse her photographs and interview, and generate a visual illness narrative with four photographs and their accompanying interview text. Her visual illness narrative reveals discovery of a post-brain injury identity whose multiplicity of self-definitions includes chef, brain injury survivor, gardener, and self-advocate. Study findings reveal that identity issues of importance to brain injury survivors can include (1) learning the new, post-brain injury self, and (2) building a new identity whose multiple, partial identities include (a) the new brain injured self, (b) an old self (with its residual strengths), and (c) a self who does meaningful activities (e.g. parenting, partnering, art, gardening, volunteering, helping others, or paid work). Study results suggest that using visual research methods can help to put biographical disruption such as brain injury into perspective as a life lived.	1	Laura S. Lorenz

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	2	For those of little or no means, leaving one's mark through financial assets, social connections, and human investment is difficult. Using secondary analysis of transcripts from face-to-face interviews with 33 terminally-ill patients from an outpatient clinic at a public hospital serving the disadvantaged in the southern United States, we examine the legacy participants wish to leave behind. As part of this process, participants assess life circumstances to try and generate a legacy allowing them to remain personally relevant to loved ones after death. For the low-SES terminally ill persons in this study, the desire to leave a material legacy and the means to do so are not congruous. In the absence of economic resources to bequeath loved ones, participants describe their desire to leave loved ones some form of ethical currency to facilitate interactions with others and protect them against social marginalisation. We call this concept ethical capital. We then argue ethical capital is a way for disadvantaged people to find dignity and to affirm their lives.	3	Beverley Williams; Lesa Woodby; Patricia Drentea
Fotaki, Marianna. 2010. 'Patient Choice and Equity in the British National Health Service: Towards Developing an Alternative Framework.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:6 898-913.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	6	Choice and competition have been phased into many public health systems with the aim of achieving various and potentially exclusive goals such as improving efficiency, quality and responsiveness to users' needs. Yet their use to promote equity of access as evidenced recently in the British National Health Service (the NHS) is unprecedented. Giving users the power of exit over unresponsive providers is meant to address the failures of previous policies. This paper shows that there is a potential conflict between choice and equity, in terms of both the values and the outcomes each policy is likely to produce. Using a multidisciplinary and multidimensional framework, drawn from Bourdieusian sociology, feminist theory and economics, the study highlights the implications of the simplistic and one-sided conception of individual patient choice in relation to equity. It also uses the existing evidence on the impact of market competition and choice, in the UK and elsewhere, to emphasise the importance of socio-economic and psycho-social factors, which are left out of current policy considerations.	1	Marianna Fotaki
Bell, Kirsten, Lucy McCullough, Amy Salmon & Jennifer Bell. 2010. '`every Space Is Claimed': Smokers' Experiences of Tobacco Denormalisation.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:6 914-929.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	12	Over the past decade, the strategy of `denormalising' tobacco use has become one of the cornerstones of the global tobacco control movement. Although tobacco denormalisation policies primarily affect people on the lowest rungs of the social ladder, few qualitative studies have explicitly set out to explore how smokers have experienced and responded to these legislative and social changes in attitudes towards tobacco use. Drawing on a qualitative study of interviews with 25 current and ex-smokers living in Vancouver, Canada, this paper examines the ways they interpret and respond to the new socio-political environment in which they must manage the increasingly problematised practice of tobacco smoking. Overall, while not opposed to smoking restrictions per se, study participants felt that recent legislation, particularly efforts to prohibit smoking in a variety of outdoor settings, was overly restrictive and that all public space had increasingly been `claimed' by non-smokers. Also apparent from participants' accounts was the high degree of stigma attached to smoking. However, although the `denormalisation' environment had encouraged several participants to quit smoking, the majority continued to smoke, raising ethical and practical questions about the value of denormalisation strategies as a way of reducing smoking-related mortality and morbidity.	4	Kirsten Bell; Lucy McCullough; Amy Salmon; Jennifer Bell
Michailakis, Dimitris & Werner Schirmer. 2010. 'Agents of Their Health? How the Swedish Welfare State Introduces Expectations of Individual Responsibility.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:6 930-947.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	7	In recent years, the notion of individual responsibility for one's health has been introduced into Swedish medico-political debate. Formerly expressed as a recommendation, it has now taken on the form of expectations. In a Swedish context, this shift from collective to individual responsibility is novel because it implies a break with well-established welfare state practice of comprehensive care for their citizens. Using a systems-theoretical approach, we interpret this shift of expectations as a political solution to the problem of legitimate allocation of scarce resources. A more inclusive medical conception of illness has facilitated the introduction of many new diagnoses that, in turn, have lead to a strong increase in claims for medical treatment and for compensation. This semantic change in medicine aggravates the budgetary situation of the welfare state. The political solution lies in a reorientation of the expectations the medical system can have on citizens as well as a shift of the expectations regarding the rights and obligations citizens can have on the medical system. Individuals are increasingly expected to live healthy lifestyles and to avoid hazardous habits. If they do not live up to these expectations, they have to face low prioritisation or denial of treatment.	2	Dimitris Michailakis; Werner Schirmer

'Linking Credentialed Skills, Social Class, Working Conditions and Self-reported Health: a Focus on Health Inequality-generating Mechanisms.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:6 948-964.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	1	In this study, focus is on the mechanisms linking credentialed skills and social class relations to five dimensions of occupational stressors and three self-reported health outcomes: persistent fatigue, musculoskeletal complaints and emotional wellbeing. We test for direct health associations of skills/class. Moreover, indirect health associations of skills/class, through differential exposure to occupational stressors and effect modifications of the occupational stressors, are tested. A modified LISREL analysis is applied to a representative cross-sectional sample of 11,099 Flemish wage-earners. The direct health effects of credentialed skills/class are limited, but they are clearly indirectly related to the self-reported health outcomes through differential exposure to occupational stressors. The indirect mechanisms point to both reinforcing and moderating effects on socio-economic health inequalities. Two cases of effect modification are also observed: social class modifying the association between control and persistent fatigue; and skills affecting the association between the quality of social relations and emotional wellbeing. Differential exposure to occupational stressors is a crucial mechanism linking skills/class to socio-economic health inequalities. Direct effects and effect modification of class/skills are relevant, but of limited importance. One of the effect modifications found suggests that a specific focus on contradictory class positions might be warranted in future research.	4	Christophe Vanroelen; Katia Levecque; Guy Moors; Fred Louckx
Williams, Roman. 2010. 'Space for God: Lived Religion at Work, Home, and Play.' Sociology of Religion. 71:3 257-279.	Sociology of Religion	2010	3	Despite modernity's attempt to structure religion out of many social domains, people still make space for God-the sacred, spirituality, religion, transcendence, etc.-in their everyday lives. Religion may be less apparent at times, but it is not altogether absent and continues to show up beyond its taken-for-granted boundaries. Drawing from photo elicitation interview materials generated by the Spiritual Narratives in Everyday Life project, I explore the ways in which religion and spirituality intersect with the domains of home, work, and leisure. At first blush, photos of homes, bedrooms, offices, beaches, pets, and gardens do not appear to be enchanted. But when one looks to the stories behind the photos, it becomes evident that the meanings these narratives convey and actions they evoke push back against the social structure as individuals leverage contextual features of everyday life to construct space for God.	1	Roman R.

Sociology of Religion	2010	3	Though predominantly Christian since the time of its founding, the United States has become more religiously diverse in recent decades. Yet since the mid-1990s, the proportion of Americans who see their country as a ``Christian nation'' has reportedly increased. Though initially paradoxical, these trends are less mysterious if the idea of a ``Christian America'' (CA) is understood, not as a description of religious demography, but as a discursive practice that seeks to align the symbolic boundaries of national belonging with the boundaries of the dominant faith community. Using data from the 1996 and 2004 General Social Survey, it is shown that the growing prevalence of CA was restricted to Americans of Christian faith, thereby widening an existing religious divide over the meaning of American identity.	2	Jeremy Brooke Straughn; Scott L.

Unnever, James, John Bartkowski & Francis Cullen. 2010. 'God Imagery and Opposition to Abortion and Capital Punishment: a Partial Test of Religious Support for the Consistent Life Ethic.' Sociology of Religion. 71:3 307-322.	Sociology of Religion	2010	4	Abortion and the death penalty are two of the most contentious issues in American public life. Previous scholarship has documented religious variations in attitudes toward each of these hotly contested issues. However, scant research has explored how religious factors affect opposition to both abortion and capital punishment, two key elements of a consistent life ethic. This study offers a partial test of religious support for the consistent life ethic by examining the extent to which the nature and quality of the relationship between God and the religious believer fosters opposition to both abortion and capital punishment. Using data from the 2004 General Social Survey, we find that a close relationship with a loving God predicts opposition to both abortion and the death penalty net of other religious factors and covariates. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings and delineating promising directions for future research.	3	James D. Unnever; John P. Bartkowski; Francis T. Cullen
Hoffmann, John, Bruce Lott & Catherine Jeppsen. 2010. 'Religious Giving and the Boundedness of Rationality*.' Sociology of Religion. 71:3 323-348.	Sociology of Religion	2010	0	We develop a model of religious giving that is based on ideas from recent studies of bounded rationality and related concepts, heuristics, religious identification, and theological-interpersonal interactions. In general, we predict that the positive association between religious service attendance, importance of religion, or beliefs about the bible and religious giving is conditioned by the strictness of the group. We also propose that there is less variability in giving in strict faith traditions. Estimating models of giving using five national data sets, we find support for the hypothesis concerning variability, but less support for the notion that the proposed associations are conditioned by strictness. The conditional effects are restricted to a data set specifically designed to examine religious giving. Moreover, the hypothesis concerning conditional effects of attendance by strictness may be most valid when measured in specific denominations.	3	John P. Hoffmann; Bruce R. Lott; Catherine Jeppsen
Cragun, Ryan & Ronald Lawson. 2010. 'the Secular Transition: the Worldwide Growth of Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Seventh-day Adventists.' Sociology of Religion. 71:3 349-373.	Sociology of Religion	2010	2	A question that continues to attract researchers in the sociology of religion is what factors lead to religious growth. This article examines three well-known Christian religious groups that share many characteristics (i.e., supply-side factors): Mormonism, Jehovah's Witnesses, and Seventh-day Adventists. Membership data from these groups were gathered from 1960 through 2006 for most countries around the world. Membership growth rates were analyzed while controlling for country-level characteristics (i.e., demand-side factors). The results of this analysis indicate that both supply- and demand-side factors are important in determining growth. The strongest predictors of growth are: growth momentum in a country, the level of economic development, and several country-level characteristics. We conclude that socioeconomic development of countries ultimately leads to a secular transition, curtailing the growth of these religious groups.	2	Ryan T. Cragun; Ronald Lawson

Guided by hypermodern theory, I conduct participant observation in the social virtual world Second Life to provide tentative answers to those questions. I suggest that Second Life is both a social psychological playground where participants enjoy individualistic fantasies and a virtual community where they collaborate on collective projects. When people define the virtual as real, it is real in its consequences. Accordingly, social virtual spaces such as Second Life offer sociologists unique opportunities for research, education, intervention, and hence the development of a virtual imagination.	1	Simon Gottschalk

The ``pastor problems'' of the last election demonstrate a bias toward issues of sincerity and authenticity in the networked public sphere. Pundits and bloggers use viral videos to construct rival representations of candidates' backstage identities. Such debates favor ``flat'' notions of authenticity, however, and decontextualization tends to thwart the critical gatekeeping functions of journalism. Religion serves as a proxy for issues of race, prophetic critique is demonized, and apocalyptic thinking is normalized.	1	Kevin Healey

Symbolic Interaction	2010	1	Whereas substantial scholarly attention has been paid to the online presentation of self, symbolic interactionist approaches are largely absent in the literature on virtual communities. Instead, recurrent questions are whether communities can exist online and whether specific online venues qualify as communities. This article aims to move beyond these dichotomous questions by studying how different meanings attached to an online venue can be understood from offline experiences. In a case study of a Dutch forum for orthodox Protestant homosexuals, two types of understanding of online community emerged from an analysis of fifteen in-depth interviews. Users struggling with stigmatization in offline life seek empathic support and have an encompassing sense of online community-the forum as ``refuge.'' For users dealing with practical everyday questions, online contacts are part of so-called personal communities and help ameliorate offline life-the forum as ``springboard.'' Apart from demonstrating that online forums can serve as Goffmanian backstages in two distinct ways, these results indicate it is fruitful to take a symbolic interactionist approach to uncover relationships between offline and online social life.	1	Willem Koster

Symbolic Interaction	2010	0	While digitally mediated environments have altered how human communication takes place, they do not necessarily alter the human condition of alienation. Applying key principles from Goffman's Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity (1963), the popular blog PostSecret offers ways in which anonymous users attempt to remedy the alienations linked with the stigmatic act of secret keeping. Through imaginative, associative, and vicarious conversations, the blog purports to offer the unconditional acceptance necessary to remedy the alienations. Because of the complications of anonymity in the nonreal reality of the internet, the blog can offer only echoes of acceptance. Although some of the stigma literature argues that self-acceptance or assertions of power are the strongest solutions to stigma's negative effects, this article extends the stigma construct with the suggestion that vulnerability might be a viable option to remedy the attendant alienations correlated with stigma.	2	Naaman Wood; Susan Ward

We consider how social events taking place within the hotel are conditioned by designed-in symbolic resources and how, in turn, with creative processes of symbolization, novel social objects emerge out of particular interactions. We then discuss how the membership trajectories of hotel members are essential in understanding how these interactions are shaped and evolve. We also look at how the digital infrastructure and its evolution lends itself to being material for actualizing particular social worlds within the hotel and how the trajectory of the infrastructure reflects the relationship between the user and the developer communities of Habbo. Finally, we discuss why, to understand more fully what virtual worlds consist of at large, analysts should look into the mutually constitutive interactions among users, developers, and surrounding business models over longer periods of time in the constantly varying actualization of any given virtual world.	3	Mikael Johnson; Sampsa Hyysalo; Sakari Tamminen
Lakoff, Andrew & Eric Klinenberg. 2010. 'of Risk and Pork: Urban Security and the Politics of Objectivity.' Theory and Society. 39:5 503-525.	Theory and Society	2010	1	This article focuses on the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) controversy as a case study in the politics of risk assessment. It examines struggles among diverse actors-think tank experts, journalists, politicians, and government officials-engaged in the contentious process of establishing a legitimate definition of risk. In the field of homeland security, the means of conducting rational risk assessment have not yet been settled, and entrepreneurial officials from urban and regional governments use different techniques to identify local risks and vulnerabilities. In this contentious process, federal bureaucrats are responsible for determining how to allocate resources fairly and rationally to different cities and metropolitan regions, given that local officials have clear incentives to request funds and little cause to refrain. Although ``rationality'' is supposed to replace ``politics'' in making bureaucratic decisions over the allocation of resources, what we find instead is a political struggle over how to define, measure, and manage risk. For political actors, victory in debates over urban security comes from codifying one's interests within the technical practice of risk assessment.	2	Andrew Lakoff; Eric Klinenberg
Ermakoff, Ivan. 2010. 'Theory of Practice, Rational Choice, and Historical Change.' Theory and Society. 39:5 527-553.	Theory and Society	2010	1	If we are to believe the proponents of the Theory of Practice and of Rational Choice, the gap between these two paradigmatic approaches cannot be bridged. They rely on ontological premises, theories of motivations and causal models that stand too far apart. In this article, I argue that this theoretical antinomy loses much of its edge when we take as objects of sociological investigation processes of historical change, that is, when we try to specify in theoretical terms how and in which conditions historical actors enact and endorse shifts in patterns of relations as well as shifts in the symbolic and cognitive categories that make these relations significant. I substantiate this argument in light of the distinction between two temporalities of historical change: first, the long waves of gradual change and, second, the short waves of moments of breaks and ruptures. Along the way, I develop an argument about the conditions of emergence of self-limiting norms and the centrality of epistemic beliefs in situations of high disruption.	1	Ivan Ermakoff
Vrecko, Scott. 2010. 'Global and Everyday Matters of Consumption: on the Productive Assemblage of Pharmaceuticals and Obesity.' Theory and Society. 39:5 555-573.	Theory and Society	2010	0	This article analyzes changing formations of global and everyday culture-particularly those associated with health, medicine, and consumption-through a concrete investigation of the development and use of anti-obesity medications. The first half of the article elucidates some of the new local-global connections being forged between fat bodies and global orders by situating the production and circulation of a new class of such medications within a sociotechnical assemblage that includes, among other elements, scientific research, transnational corporations, overweight individuals and populations, and the internet. The second half of the article explores the forms of local and everyday pharmaceutical practice associated with these medications. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with medication users, I demonstrate that while biomedical models focus on the physiological and psychological effects of drug interventions, the significance of the medications in practices of everyday life is largely socio-spatial. I suggest that these medication provide a means of protecting individuals from a hostile modern environment-the obesogenic landscape of hyperconsumption-and argue that the practices associated with the use of obesity medications can be understood as part of the work of accommodating and reproducing contemporary consumer and capitalist culture.	1	Scott Vrecko

Theory and Society	2010	0	The difficulty in conceptualizing health and social care resides in its complex and dialectical character: its constitutive social relations are not reducible to a single logic or type of actor; it is both a descriptive and a normative idea, a tool of classification and evaluation, a means of analysis and a weapon of critique. It is both theoretical and practical, a scientific construct and an ethical stance, rooted both in academic disciplines and the manifold practices of health and social care. This article draws out the radical core of the concept of care as a dialogical form of labor that transcends mere instrumental or strategic action; it then explores the contradictions of this praxis in the context of the social division of care in late capitalism.	1	Paul Leduc Browne

American Sociological Review. 75:4 479-504.	American Sociological Review	2010	4	Environmental justice scholars have suggested that because chemical plants and other hazardous facilities emit more pollutants where they face the least resistance, disadvantaged communities face a special health risk. In trying to determine whether race or income has the bigger impact on a neighborhood's exposure to pollution, however, scholars tend to overlook the facilities themselves and the effect of their characteristics on emissions. In particular, how do the characteristics of facilities and their surrounding communities jointly shape pollution outcomes? We propose a new line of environmental justice research that focuses on facilities and how their features combine with communities' features to create dangerous emissions. Using novel fuzzy-set analysis techniques and the EPA's newly developed Risk-Screening Environmental Indicators, we test the influence of facility and community factors on chemical plants' health-threatening emissions. Contrary to the idea that community characteristics have singular, linear effects, findings show that facility and community factors combine in a variety of ways to produce risky emissions. We speculate that as chemical firms experiment with different ways of producing goods and externalizing pollution costs, new ``recipes of risk'' are likely to emerge. The question, then, will no longer be whether race or income matters most, but in which of these recipes do they matter and how.	4	Don Grant; Mary Nell Trautner; Liam Downey; Lisa Thiebaud
Longhofer, Wesley & Evan Schofer. 2010. 'National and Global Origins of Environmental Association.' American Sociological Review. 75:4 505-533.	American Sociological Review	2010	17	We examine the origins of voluntary associations devoted to environmental protection, focusing on the divergent trajectories of industrialized versus developing countries. We consider a wide range of domestic economic, political, and institutional dynamics that give rise to environmental associations. Developing and extending neo-institutional world polity arguments, we characterize domestic association in the developing world as the product of global cultural models, legitimation, and resources. Using event history and dynamic panel models, we analyze the formation of domestic environmental associations for a large sample of countries in the contemporary period. Among highly industrialized countries, domestic factors-resources and political institutions that afford favorable opportunities-largely explain the prevalence of environmental associations. In contrast, global forces are a powerful catalyst for environmental organizing in the developing world. The environmental movement, which had domestic origins in the West, became institutionalized in the world polity, generating new associations on a global scale. We also find positive effects of democratic institutions and philanthropic foundations. Environmental degradation and societal affluence are not primary drivers of environmental association. We conclude by reflecting on the implications of globally-sponsored voluntary associations, which appear to be common in the developing world.	2	Wesley Longhofer; Evan Schofer

American Sociological Review	2010	10	This study estimates the effects of prenatal poverty on birth weight using changes in state Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC) as a natural experiment. We seek to answer two questions about poverty and child wellbeing. First, are there associations between prenatal poverty and lower birth weights even after factoring out unmeasured potential confounders? Because birth weight predicts a range of outcomes across the life course, lower birth weights that result from poverty may have lasting consequences for children's life chances. Second, how have recent expansions of a work-based welfare program (i.e., the EITC) affected maternal and infant health? In recent decades, U. S. poverty relief has become increasingly tied to earnings and labor markets, but the consequences for children's wellbeing remain controversial. We find that state EITCs increase birth weights and reduce maternal smoking. However, results related to AFDC/TANF and varying EITC effects across maternal ages raise cautionary messages.	3	Kate W.

American Sociological Review	2010	4	Sociologists have long recognized that historical events, such as wars, depressions, and natural disasters, influence trajectories of people's lives and reproduce or alter social structures. This article extends that line of research. Using data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I test three accounts regarding how combat exposure in war affects men's ability to work. The direct cumulative disadvantage account posits that war negatively affects servicemen who see combat, regardless of their pre-combat characteristics. The moderated cumulative disadvantage account suggests that combat most negatively affects men who had lower status before they fought. The turning point account suggests the reverse: combat most negatively affects men who had greater status before they fought. Findings suggest that with regard to disability and unemployment, the effects of combat exposure in war are most consistent with the direct cumulative disadvantage account.	1	Alair MacLean
Wilde, Melissa, Kristin Geraty, Shelley Nelson & Emily Bowman. 2010. 'Religious Economy or Organizational Field? Predicting Bishops' Votes at the Second Vatican Council.' American Sociological Review. 75:4 586-606.	American Sociological Review	2010	3	This article explores the national factors that predict bishops' votes on two of the most contentious issues at the Second Vatican Council. Using data obtained from the Vatican Secret Archive, analyses demonstrate that rational choice oriented theory in the sociology of religion that focuses on competition is limited. While competition is important to religious leaders' actions, its effects can be understood only in relation to other crucial characteristics of the social environment within which leaders operate. These characteristics, which we derive from Neo-Institutional Theory (NIT), shape leaders' interests and often lead them to prioritize concerns about their institutions' legitimacy over the concerns about efficiency and growth rational choice theorists assume are predominant. Most NIT studies examine the population of firms within one organizational field. Because we hold firm constant and examine how variation in the type of organizational field (supplied by the more than 100 countries in our analyses) predicts firm leaders' actions, this study represents a unique test of NIT.	4	Melissa J.

Stamatov, Peter. 2010. 'Activist Religion, Empire, and the Emergence of Modern Long-distance Advocacy Networks.' American Sociological Review. 75:4 607-628.	American Sociological Review	2010	7	Considering long-distance advocacy as a distinctive institution of European modernity, the article examines the genesis and history of networks engaged in political action on behalf of distant others. Ever since the beginnings of European expansion overseas in the sixteenth century, such networks have originated from a persistent pattern of radicalization of religious actors against rival networks within the context of empire. In the late eighteenth century, the very same processes led to the establishment of modern forms of long-distance advocacy, with the international movement against colonial slavery and the slave trade. Throughout, long-distance advocacy was initiated and carried out by distinctively reformist and activist religious organizations within Catholicism and Protestantism. These findings highlight the importance of religious organizations in the imperial context for the configuration of modern forms of political activism.	1	Peter Stamatov
Zimmer, Zachary & Kim Korinek. 2010. 'Shifting Coresidence Near the End of Life: Comparing Decedents and Survivors of a Follow-up Study in China.' Demography. 47:3 537-554.	Demography	2010	5	What we know about transitions in coresidence of elders in China is based on panel data involving survivors. This article examines the tendency to and determinants of shifts in coresidence with adult children among the very old, comparing survivors of an intersurvey period with those who died (decedents). Data come from the Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey. Baseline and follow-up surveys indicate shifts in coresidence, defined as change from not living with an adult child to living in the same household as an adult child, and the converse. Rates of shifting are adjusted for time to follow-up. Regressions examine predictors of shifts among four groups: baseline coresident and noncoresident survivors and decedents. Decedents and noncoresidents are more likely to shift than survivors and coresidents. Covariates related to physical and material need as well as marital status are the strongest predictors of shift. Thus, the needs of a very old person dominate coresidential shifts and stability, lending support to an altruistic notion of living arrangement decision making. In the end, we conclude that the period nearing the end of life is a time of flux in living situation and that coresidential shifts are underestimated when those who die during a follow-up study are ignored.	2	Zachary Zimmer; Kim Korinek
Rogers, Richard, Bethany Everett, Jarron Saint & Patrick Krueger. 2010. 'Social, Behavioral, and Biological Factors, and Sex Differences in Mortality.' Demography. 47:3 555-578.	Demography	2010	9	Few studies have examined whether sex differences in mortality are associated with different distributions of risk factors or result from the unique relationships between risk factors and mortality for men and women. We extend previous research by systematically testing a variety of factors, including health behaviors, social ties, socioeconomic status, and biological indicators of health. We employ the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey III Linked Mortality File and use Cox proportional hazards models to examine sex differences in adult mortality in the United States. Our findings document that social and behavioral characteristics are key factors related to the sex gap in mortality Once we control for women's lower levels of marriage, poverty, and exercise, the sex gap in mortality widens; and once we control for women's greater propensity to visit with friends and relatives, attend religious services, and abstain from smoking, the sex gap in mortality narrows. Biological factors including indicators of inflammation and cardiovascular risk-also inform sex differences in mortality. Nevertheless, persistent sex differences in mortality remain: compared with women, men have 30\% to 83\% higher risks of death over the follow-up period, depending on the covariates included in the model. Although the prevalence of risk factors differs by sex, the impact of those risk factors on mortality is similar for men and women.	4	Richard G. Rogers; Bethany G. Everett; Jarron M.

Jin, Lei, Felix Elwert, Jeremy Freese & Nicholas Christakis. 2010. 'Preliminary Evidence Regarding the Hypothesis That the Sex Ratio at Sexual Maturity May Affect Longevity in Men.' Demography. 47:3 579-586.	Demography	2010	5	In human populations, variation in mate availability has been linked to various biological and social outcomes, but the possible effect of mate availability on health or survival has not been studied. Unbalanced sex ratios are a concern in many parts of the world, and their implications for the health and survival of the constituent individuals warrant careful investigation. We indexed mate availability with contextual sex ratios and investigated the hypothesis that the sex ratio at sexual maturity might be associated with long-term survival for men. Using two unique data sets of 7,683,462 and 4,183 men who were followed for more than 50 years, we found that men who reached their sexual maturity in an environment with higher sex ratios (i.e., higher proportions of reproductively ready men) appeared to suffer higher long-term mortality risks than those in an environment with lower sex ratios. Mate availability at sexual maturity may be linked via several biological and social mechanisms to long-term survival in men.	4	Lei Jin; Felix Elwert; Jeremy Freese; Nicholas A. Christakis
Patterson, Evelyn. 2010. 'Incarcerating Death: Mortality in Us State Correctional Facilities, 1985-1998.' Demography. 47:3 587-607.	Demography	2010	12	Using data from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics and Census Bureau, I estimate death rates of working-age prisoners and nonprisoners by sex and race. Incarceration was more detrimental to females in comparison to their male counterparts in the period covered by this study. White male prisoners had higher death rates than white males who were not in prison. Black male prisoners, however, consistently exhibited lower death rates than black male nonprisoners did. Additionally, the findings indicate that while the relative difference in mortality levels of white and black males was quite high outside of prison, it essentially disappeared in prison. Notably, removing deaths caused by firearms and motor vehicles in the nonprison population accounted for some of the mortality differential between black prisoners and nonprisoners. The death rates of the other groups analyzed suggest that prison is an unhealthy environment; yet, prison appears to be a healthier place than the typical environment of the nonincarcerated black male population. These findings suggest that firearms and motor vehicle accidents do not sufficiently explain the higher death rates of black males, and they indicate that a lack of basic healthcare may be implicated in the death rates of black males not incarcerated.	1	Evelyn J.

Skoog, Gary & James Ciecka. 2010. 'Measuring Years of Inactivity, Years in Retirement, Time to Retirement, and Age at Retirement Within the Markov Model.' Demography. 47:3 609-628.	Demography	2010	3	Retirement-related concepts are treated as random variables within Markov process models that capture multiple labor force entries and exits. The expected number of years spent outside of the labor force, expected years in retirement, and expected age at retirement are computed all of which are of immense policy interest but have been heretofore reported with less precisely measured proxies. Expected age at retirement varies directly with a person's age; but even younger people can expect to retire at ages substantially older than those commonly associated with retirement, such as age 60, 62, or 65. Between 1970 and 2003, men allocated most of their increase in life expectancy to increased time in retirement, but women allocated most of their increased life expectancy to labor force activity. Although people can exit and reenter the labor force at older ages, most 65-year-old men who are active in the labor force will not reenter after they eventually exit. At age 65, the probability that those who are inactive will reenter the labor force at some future time is .38 for men and .27 for women. Life expectancy at exact ages is decomposed into the sum of the expected time spent active and inactive in the labor force, and also as the sum of the expected time to labor force separation and time in retirement.	2	Gary R.

Schmertmann, Carl, Renato Assuncao & Joseph Potter. 2010. 'Knox Meets Cox: Adapting Epidemiological Space-time Statistics to Demographic Studies.' Demography. 47:3 629-650.	Demography	2010	3	Many important questions and theories in demography focus on changes over time, and on how those changes differ over geographic and social space. Space-time analysis has always been important in studying fertility transitions, for example. However demographers have seldom used formal statistical methods to describe and analyze time series of maps. One formal method, used widely in epidemiology, criminology, and public health, is Knox's space-time interaction test. In this article, we discuss the potential of the Knox test in demographic research and note some possible pitfalls. We demonstrate how to use familiar proportional hazards models to adapt the Knox test for demographic applications. These adaptations allow for nonrepeatable events and for the incorporation of structural variables that change in space and time. We apply the modified test to data on the onset of fertility decline in Brazil over 1960-2000 and show how the modified method can produce maps indicating where and when diffusion effects seem strongest, net of covariate effects.	3	Carl P.

Obare, Francis. 2010. 'Nonresponse in Repeat Population-based Voluntary Counseling and Testing for Hiv in Rural Malawi.' Demography. 47:3 651-665.	Demography	2010	0	Despite the increasing number of population-based surveys in sub-Saharan Africa that provide testing and counseling for HIV over the past decade, understanding the nature of nonresponse in these surveys, especially panel HIV surveys, is still limited. This article uses longitudinal HIV data collected from rural Malawi in 2004 and 2006 to examine nonresponse in repeat population-based testing. It shows that nonresponse in repeat testing led to significant bias in the estimates of HIV prevalence and to inconsistent conclusions about the predictors of HIV status. In contrast, previous cross-sectional analyses found that nonresponse does not significantly bias the estimates of HIV prevalence. The difference in conclusions from cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses of nonresponse can be attributed to two factors: the different definitions of what constitutes nonresponse in both contexts, and the risk profiles of the missed populations. In particular although refusal and temporary absence are the major sources of nonresponse in the cross-sectional contexts, attrition attributable to mortality and out-migration are additional sources of nonresponse in repeat testing. Evidence shows that out-migrants have higher HIV prevalence than nonmigrants, which could account for significant bias in the estimates of prevalence among participants in both tests observed in this study.	1	Francis Obare
Desai, Sonalde & Lester Andrist. 2010. 'Gender Scripts and Age at Marriage in India.' Demography. 47:3 667-687.	Demography	2010	9	Research on marriage in developing countries has been somewhat narrow in scope because of both conceptual and data limitations. While the feminist literature recognizes marriage as a key institutional site for the production and reproduction of gender hierarchies, little is known about the processes through which this relationship operates. This article uses data from the newly collected India Human Development Survey 2005 for 27,365 ever-married women aged 25-49 to explore ways in which different dimensions of gender in Indian society shape the decisions regarding age at marriage. We explore the impact of three dimensions of gender: (1) economic factors, such as availability of wage employment, dowry expectations, and wedding expenses; (2) indicators of familial empowerment, such as women's role in household decision making and access to and control over resources; and (3) markers of gender performance, such as observance of purdah and male-female separation in the household. Results from hierarchical linear models confirm the importance of markers of gender performance but fail to demonstrate a large role for economic factors and familial empowerment.	2	Sonalde Desai; Lester Andrist
Dahl, Gordon. 2010. 'Early Teen Marriage and Future Poverty.' Demography. 47:3 689-718.	Demography	2010	7	Both early teen marriage and dropping out of high school have historically been associated with a variety of negative outcomes, including higher poverty rates throughout life. Are these negative outcomes due to preexisting differences, or do they represent the causal effect of marriage and schooling choices? To better understand the true personal and societal consequences, in this article, I use an instrumental variables (IV) approach that takes advantage of variation in state laws regulating the age at which individuals are allowed to marry, drop out of school, and begin work. The baseline IV estimate indicates that a woman who marries young is 31 percentage points more likely to live in poverty when she is older Similarly, a woman who drops out of school is 11 percentage points more likely to be poor. The results are robust to a variety of alternative specifications and estimation methods, including limited information maximum likelihood (LIML) estimation and a control function approach. While grouped ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates for the early teen marriage variable are also large, OLS estimates based on individual-level data are small, consistent with a large amount of measurement error.	1	Gordon B.

Reinhold, Steffen. 2010. 'Reassessing the Link Between Premarital Cohabitation and Marital Instability.' Demography. 47:3 719-733.	Demography	2010	8	Premarital cohabitation has been found to be positively correlated with the likelihood of marital dissolution in the United States. To reassess this link, I estimate proportional hazard models of marital dissolution for first marriages by using pooled data from the 1988, 1995, and 2002 surveys of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG). These results suggest that the positive relationship between premarital cohabitation and marital instability has weakened for more recent birth and marriage cohorts. Using multiple marital outcomes for a person to account for one source of unobserved heterogeneity, panel models suggest that cohabitation is not selective of individuals with higher risk of marital dissolution and may be a stabilizing factor for higher-order marriages. Further research with more recent data is needed to assess whether these results are statistical artifacts caused by data weaknesses in the NSFG.	1	Steffen Reinhold
Schwartz, Christine. 2010. 'Pathways to Educational Homogamy in Marital and Cohabiting Unions.' Demography. 47:3 735-753.	Demography	2010	7	There is considerable disagreement about whether cohabitors are more or less likely to be educationally homogamous than married couples. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, I reconcile many of the disparate findings of previous research by conducting a ``stock and flow'' analysis of assortative cohabitation and marriage. I find that cohabitors are less likely to be educationally homogamous than married couples overall, but these differences are not apparent when cohabiting and marital unions begin. Instead, the results suggest that differences in educational homo gamy by union type are driven by selective exits from marriage and cohabitation rather than by differences in partner choice. Marriages that cross educational boundaries are particularly likely to end. The findings suggest that although cohabitors place greater emphasis on egalitarianism than married couples, this does not translate into greater educational homo gamy The findings are also consistent with a large body of research on cohabitation and divorce questioning the effectiveness of cohabitation as a trial marriage.	1	Christine R.

Demography	2010	15	I use U.S. census data to perform the first large-sample, nationally representative tests of outcomes for children raised by same-sex couples. The results show that children of same-sex couples are as likely to make normal progress through school as the children of most other family structures. Heterosexual married couples are the family type whose children have the lowest rates of grade retention, but the advantage of heterosexual married couples is mostly due to their higher socioeconomic status. Children of all family types (including children of same-sex couples) are far more likely to make normal progress through school than are children living in group quarters (such as orphanages and shelters).	1	Michael J.

Sastry, Narayan & Anne Pebley. 2010. 'Family and Neighborhood Sources of Socioeconomic Inequality in Children's Achievement.' Demography. 47:3 777-800.	Demography	2010	7	We examined family and neighborhood sources of socioeconomic inequality in children's reading and mathematics achievement using data from the 2000-2001 Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey. To describe inequality in achievement scores, we used Gini coefficients and concentration indices and multilevel regression models. We found no inequality in children's achievement by family income when other variables in the model were held constant. Mother's reading scores and average neighborhood levels of income accounted for the largest proportion of inequality in children's achievement. Neighborhood economic status appears to be strongly associated with children's skills acquisition.	2	Narayan Sastry; Anne R. Pebley
Sana, Mariano. 2010. 'Immigrants and Natives in Us Science and Engineering Occupations, 1994-2006.' Demography. 47:3 801-820.	Demography	2010	0	Between 1994 and 2006, the ratio of foreign-born scientists and engineers (FSE) to native scientists and engineers (NSE) doubled. I decompose this change into a migration effect (which accounts for migration in general), a proportional college effect (which accounts for the relative proportions of college graduates among migrant and native workers), and a proportional science and engineering (S\&E) effect (which accounts for the relative proportions of S\&Es among migrant and native college-educated workers). Results show that the migration effect explains about three-quarters of the increase in FSE/NSE during the entire period under study. The proportional S\&E effect, which captures changes in the ratio as a result of immigration of S\&Es in excess of what would be expected from general migration alone, was largest in 1995-1998, which were years of sustained economic growth. Conversely, a slower economy coincided with a declining proportional S\&E effect after 2000. Increases in the annual cap on H-IB visas, an important avenue of entry for foreign-born S\&Es, had little effect on the ratio. In short, during 1994-2006, the association between economic swings and the specific, more than proportional migration of S\&Es was much stronger than the association between the latter and changes in the H-IB cap.	1	Mariano Sana
Lois, Jennifer. 2010. 'the Temporal Emotion Work of Motherhood Homeschoolers' Strategies for Managing Time Shortage.' Gender \& Society. 24:4 421-446.	Gender \& Society	2010	2	Drawing on fieldwork and in-depth interviews with homeschooling mothers in the Pacific Northwest, the author reveals several ways the temporal experience of motherhood was emotionally problematic. The intensive demands of homeschooling left them stressed and dissatisfied with the amount of time they had to pursue their own interests. Mothers tried to allocate their time differently to manage these feelings, yet their efforts were unsuccessful, which led them to become frustrated and resentful. To resolve these troublesome feelings, mothers resorted to manipulating their subjective experiences of time through a process the author calls ``temporal emotion work.'' In the conclusion, the author examines the theoretical confluence of emotions and temporality, suggesting that the dominant form of motherhood is culturally defined as a ``time-sensitive identity'' and that ``temporal emotions'' are unique tools in managing the emotional difficulties inherent in the trajectories of some identities.	1	Jennifer Lois
Legerski, Elizabeth & Marie Cornwall. 2010. 'Working-class Job Loss, Gender, and the Negotiation of Household Labor.' Gender \& Society. 24:4 447-474.	Gender \& Society	2010	10	Scholars see the gendered division of household labor as a stronghold of gender inequality. We explore changes in household labor and gender relations when conservative, working-class families experience employment disruptions. Using data from 49 qualitative interviews conducted with men and women following the forced unemployment of breadwinning husbands, we observe some change in gendered household labor but conclude that a significant degendering of housework is thwarted by institutional-, interactive-, and individual-level processes. At the institutional level, the lack of well-paying jobs and the persistent gendering of household tasks discourage change. At the individual level, challenges to gendered identities encourage a reinforcement of traditional gender ideologies. At the interactional level, women's responsibility for care work and the meaning of paid work for unemployed husbands forestall the adjustment of tasks.	2	Elizabeth Miklya Legerski; Marie Cornwall
Frederick, Angela. 2010. '``practicing Electoral Politics in the Cracks'' Intersectional Consciousness in a Latina Candidate's City Council Campaign.' Gender \& Society. 24:4 475-498.	Gender \& Society	2010	1	Previous research on gender and political leadership has narrowly defined gender consciousness, failing to account for the broader commitments, concerns, and loyalties held by women of color. In this article, the author calls for an intersectional approach to analyzing the gender consciousness of political leaders. She presents findings from four months of participant observation in a Latina candidate's campaign for city council. The author finds that the campaign presented an intersectional consciousness in the candidate's messages, using gendered discourses to frame her commitment to issues of greatest concern to Hispanic and low-income communities. The campaign's mobilization efforts targeted both women and Hispanics, but focused most of its resources into courting the vote of middle- and upper-class white women. Contrary to recent claims that intersectionality has outlived its usefulness as an analytic tool, the author argues that intersectionality remains an underutilized and much-needed framework for helping to close gaps in the understanding of political life.	1	Angela Howard Frederick
Nugent, Colleen. 2010. 'Children's Surnames, Moral Dilemmas Accounting for the Predominance of Fathers' Surnames for Children.' Gender \& Society. 24:4 499-525.	Gender \& Society	2010	6	This content analysis examines online accounts of choices of marital and child surnames to understand the predominance of exclusively patrilineal surnames. I demonstrate how surnaming processes present the classic tension between commitment to self and others as moral dilemmas of self versus family, children, and spouse. Social and cultural mechanisms create an either/or exclusive framing and a false dichotomy where women's selves and others' needs are incompatible. I also show how some parents reconceptualize family, children, and expectations for men and women, which helps reconfigure dilemmas into a both/and inclusive framework and permits outcomes integrating self, family, children, and partnership. This study illustrates how maintaining a system that promotes giving fathers' surnames to children as the only proper choice feeds the inertia of micro- and macro-structures that reflect and reinforce gendered differences in moral responsibility regarding self-sacrifice for family, children, and spouses.	1	Colleen Nugent
Wight, Vanessa, Joseph Price, Suzanne Bianchi & Bijou Hunt. 2009. 'the Time Use of Teenagers.' Social Science Research. 38:4 792-809.	Social Science Research	2009	9	This paper uses American Time Use Survey (ATUS) data to describe the time use of teenagers ages 15-17, with a focus on activities that may affect teenagers' well-being such as sleep, eating, schoolwork, and selected leisure activities. We find that teenagers with an employed mother spend less time on homework and computers, are less likely to eat with parents, but spend more time in supervised activities. Teenagers with a single mother spend more time in paid work, are less likely to eat dinner with their parent, and spend more time in unsupervised activities, but they also get more sleep. Adolescents with more educated mothers spend more time studying and on the computer, less time watching television, and are more likely to eat dinner with parents. Family income correlates positively with teenagers' paid work, homework, computer use, and the likelihood of eating with parents, but is negatively associated with sleep. Family size is positively related to time spent in caregiving activities, sleep, and eating with parents, but is associated with less computer use.	4	Vanessa R. Wight; Joseph Price; Suzanne M.

Yet many students begin high school with low levels of efficacy and self-worth, and low levels of identification with and liking of school. In this study, we investigate the hypothesis that vocational education in high school provides disengaged students with an educational clean slate, leading to a recovery of engagement for at-risk students. Using propensity score models, we assess the relationship between vocational course taking and changes in effort, extracurricular participation, sense of belonging, interest in school, attitudes toward school and teachers, educational expectations, career aspirations, locus of control, and self-concept with the NELS:88 database.	2	Sean Kelly; Heather Price
Ewert, Stephanie. 2009. 'Student Misbehavior During Senior Year: a Comparison of Immigrants and the Native-born.' Social Science Research. 38:4 826-839.	Social Science Research	2009	4	Prior research has increasingly shown that the length of time in the U.S. and acculturation may have negative effects on a variety of immigrant outcomes, including academic performance, health, and occupational attainment. However, much of the research on the educational outcomes of immigrants focuses primarily on their academic achievement but neglects another factor that affects educational success-behavior at school. Using data from a sample of high school seniors in several Pacific Northwest school districts. I examine whether more time in the U.S. increases school misbehavior by testing the effects of immigrant generation and indicators of acculturation on three measures of disciplinary problems during the senior year of high school-attending class unprepared, getting in trouble for breaking school rules, and being put on suspension. First and one-point-five generation immigrants attend class more prepared and get into less trouble for breaking the school rules than do third or higher generation students during their senior year of high school. High academic performance and indicators of acculturation explain only part of this beneficial effect of immigrant generation on behavior at school. Additional analyses show that second generation Asian immigrants are more similar to first and 1.5 generation immigrants from all racial and ethnic groups than they are from other second generation racial and ethnic groups in regards to moderate and intermediate behavior.	1	Stephanie Ewert
Mendola, D., A. Busetta & A. Aassve. 2009. 'What Keeps Young Adults in Permanent Poverty? a Comparative Analysis Using Echp.' Social Science Research. 38:4 840-857.	Social Science Research	2009	6	Previous studies suggest that there are strong differences in the rates of youth poverty across European countries. Rather surprisingly, it is found to be high in Scandinavian countries, and relatively speaking, lower in Mediterranean and Anglo-Saxon countries. This somewhat unexpected finding prompts the question whether the incidence of poverty is an appropriate measure of youth disadvantage. Instead of considering poverty rates we consider the length of recorded poverty spells, taking into account explicitly the temporal sequencing of the episodes of poverty. Using the European Community Household Panel, individuals are classified into different groups of poverty permanence, each reflecting severity of social disadvantage. Based on these categories we implement a generalized ordinal logit model to assess the various factors associated with social disadvantage among youth. We find that cross-national patterns differ from those found in previous studies. In particular from our findings it does not result that poverty is highest among young people in Social Democratic countries. Our analysis shows important gender differences, though they are not the same across the countries included in the study. For some countries it turns out that being a woman is a protective factor against long-term poverty. As previous studies suggests, young individuals' living arrangements matter.	3	D. Mendola; A.

Chen, Juan, Gilbert Gee, Michael Spencer, Sheldon Danziger & David Takeuchi. 2009. 'Perceived Social Standing Among Asian Immigrants in the Us: Do Reasons for Immigration Matter?.' Social Science Research. 38:4 858-869.	Social Science Research	2009	3	We investigate the association between a subjective measure of social status and the reasons for immigration among Asian immigrants in the US. We use data from the National Latino and Asian American Study to test several hypotheses about this association. Our analyses show the positive effect on perceived social standing of migrating for better education, the negative effect of migrating to seek employment, and the negative impact of refugee status. Migrating for family reunification can be associated with various circumstances, which lead to differing outcomes. The results suggest that the notion that immigrants arrive in the US with limited resources and few skills and move slowly up the socioeconomic ladder must be reassessed in light of the complex social context and factors such as ethnicity, gender, divergent immigration paths, and a range of associated circumstances.	5	Juan Chen; Gilbert C.

Martinovic, Borja, Frank Tubergen & Ineke Maas. 2009. 'Changes in Immigrants' Social Integration During the Stay in the Host Country: the Case of Non-western Immigrants in the Netherlands.' Social Science Research. 38:4 870-882.	Social Science Research	2009	5	Previous studies on social integration of immigrants were predominantly of static nature. This article provides a dynamic account by distinguishing differences in social integration that develop shortly after immigrants' arrival in the host country from changes with length of stay. We examine contacts in leisure time between natives and non-western immigrants in the Netherlands. Theories from research on ethnic intermarriage are applied to these more common forms of contact. We use pooled cross-sectional survey data from 1988-2002. The results show that on average social integration increases with length of stay. Ethnicity, migration motive and home country education account for differences in integration that develop shortly after arrival and are maintained or even increased with length of stay, while the size of the immigrant group matters mainly at entry and then loses its influence over time. Age at migration exclusively explains differences in social integration that develop with length of stay.	3	Borja Martinovic; Frank Tubergen; Ineke Maas
Williams, Nathalie. 2009. 'Education, Gender, and Migration in the Context of Social Change.' Social Science Research. 38:4 883-896.	Social Science Research	2009	6	Although sociologists have identified education as likely determinant of migration, the ways in which education affects migration are unclear and empirical results are disparate. This paper addresses the relationship between educational attainment, enrolment, and migration, focusing on the role of gender and how it changes with evolving social contexts. Using empirical analyses based in Nepal, results indicate that educational attainment has positive effects and enrolment has negative effects on out-migration and including enrolment in the model increases the effect of attainment. In the case of women, with the changing role of gender, increased education and labor force participation, the affect of educational attainment changes drastically over time, from almost no effect, to a strong positive effect. Consideration of enrolment, and the role of gender in education, employment, and marriage may help to explain the disparate results in past research on education and migration.	1	Nathalie Williams
Hirschman, Charles & Elizabeth Mogford. 2009. 'Immigration and the American Industrial Revolution From 1880 to 1920.' Social Science Research. 38:4 897-920.	Social Science Research	2009	0	In this study, we measure the contribution of immigrants and their descendents to the growth and industrial transformation of the American workforce in the age of mass immigration from 1880 to 1920. The size and selectivity of the immigrant community, as well as their disproportionate residence in large cities, meant they were the mainstay of the American industrial workforce. Immigrants and their children comprised over half of manufacturing workers in 1920, and if the third generation (the grandchildren of immigrants) are included, then more than two-thirds of workers in the manufacturing sector were of recent immigrant stock. Although higher wages and better working conditions might have encouraged more long-resident native-born workers to the industrial economy, the scale and pace of the American industrial revolution might well have slowed. The closing of the door to mass immigration in the 1920s did lead to increased recruitment of native born workers, particularly from the South, to northern industrial cities in the middle decades of the 20th century.	2	Charles Hirschman; Elizabeth Mogford
Rost, Nicolas, Gerald Schneider & Johannes Kleibl. 2009. 'a Global Risk Assessment Model for Civil Wars.' Social Science Research. 38:4 921-933.	Social Science Research	2009	5	In this study, we construct a multivariate model that assesses the risk of an outbreak of civil war in a country over a period of 5 years into the future. In addition to structural factors of state weakness, which have dominated the literature on civil war onset, this model includes repression of basic human rights to personal integrity - an important harbinger of wars to come - as an aspect of state behavior. Our aim is not to explore the causal factors of civil war onset, but to build a model that includes indicators that correlate with civil war outbreak and may be used to predict it. Based on two versions of the model - logit and neural network - out-of-sample risk assessments for three different time periods are generated and compared to the historical record of civil war outbreak during those years. In addition, the model's ability to produce in-sample risk assessments over a 5-year period is tested. Finally, we compute truly predictive civil war risk assessments for all countries for which data are available, for the years 2008-2012. The analyses show that with a relatively simple model and based on publicly available data sources, meaningful civil war risk assessments can be computed. The quality of the predictions exceeds that of prominent studies, in which the risk of interstate war is assessed.	3	Nicolas Rost; Gerald Schneider; Johannes Kleibl
Gerson, Kathleen. 2009. 'Changing Lives, Resistant Institutions: a New Generation Negotiates Gender, Work, and Family Change.' Sociological Forum. 24:4 735-753.	Sociological Forum	2009	7	Sociology's enduring concern with explaining the links between individual and social change has never been more relevant. We are poised at a moment when changing lives are colliding with resistant institutions. These tensions have created social conflicts and personal dilemmas for women and men alike. To explain the interplay between lives and institutions and to develop effective strategies for transcending the impasse between public demands and private needs, we need a deeper understanding of how these structural and cultural conflicts play out in the lives of young women and men. This article proposes a framework for such an inquiry.	1	Kathleen Gerson
Carr, Deborah & Sara Moorman. 2009. 'End-of-life Treatment Preferences Among Older Adults: an Assessment of Psychosocial Influences.' Sociological Forum. 24:4 754-778.	Sociological Forum	2009	2	We explore the content and correlates of older adults' end-of-life treatment preferences in two hypothetical terminal illness scenarios: severe physical pain with no cognitive impairment, and severe cognitive impairment with no physical pain. For each scenario, we assess whether participants would reject life-prolonging treatment, accept treatment, or do not know their preferences. Using data from the 2004 wave of the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (N = 5,106), we estimate multinomial logistic regression models to evaluate whether treatment preferences are associated with direct experience with end-of-life issues, personal beliefs, health, and sociodemographic characteristics. Persons who have made formal end-of-life preparations, persons with no religious affiliation, mainline Protestants, and persons who are pessimistic about their own life expectancy are more likely to reject treatment in both scenarios. Women and persons who witnessed the painful death of a loved one are more likely to reject treatment in the cognitive impairment scenario only. Consistent with rational choice perspectives, our results suggest that individuals prefer treatments that they perceive to have highly probable desirable consequences for both self and family.	2	Deborah Carr; Sara M.

Connor, Phillip. 2009. 'International Migration and Religious Participation: the Mediating Impact of Individual and Contextual Effects.' Sociological Forum. 24:4 779-803.	Sociological Forum	2009	13	Supported by previous empirical work, theory from sociology of religion and migration provide testable hypotheses in predicting changes in immigrant religious participation surrounding the migratory event. Due to data constraints, however, these hypotheses have escaped broad-based analysis. Using the New Immigrant Survey (NIS), religious participation from pre- to postmigration time periods is found to decrease among recent immigrants to the United States. Individual-level characteristics (i.e., gender, familial conditions, employment) do not substantially explain this decline; alternatively, contextual-level factors (i.e., religious pluralism and religious concentration) partially mediate this drop in immigrant religiosity.	1	Phillip Connor
Carpenter, Laura. 2009. 'Virginity Loss in Reel/real Life: Using Popular Movies to Navigate Sexual Initiation.' Sociological Forum. 24:4 804-827.	Sociological Forum	2009	0	This study examines virginity-loss movies as tools for navigating early sexual life. Data come from qualitative content analyses of 25 movies and in-depth interviews with 61 socially diverse women and men, focusing on 28 participants who reported using movies to make sense of virginity loss. Films are open to multiple interpretations and young people use them creatively, both prospectively and retrospectively. Discrepancies between participants' personal stories and the scripts in nominated films were patterned by gender and ``nonideal'' experiences were resolved more positively in movies than in real life. Such discrepancies may increase feelings of distress after ``imperfect'' virginity-loss encounters.	1	Laura M. Carpenter
Rich, Meghan. 2009. '``it Depends on How You Define Integrated'': Neighborhood Boundaries and Racial Integration in a Baltimore Neighborhood.' Sociological Forum. 24:4 828-853.	Sociological Forum	2009	7	There are a significant number of racially integrated neighborhoods in the United States, many of which have been stable over time. However, very little is known about the characteristics of these neighborhoods and of the residents who live in them. With data taken from a larger study of an integrated neighborhood in Baltimore, Maryland, this article discusses homeowners' perceptions of their community and racial integration. Fifty semi-structured interviews were completed with 67 homeowners to investigate their perceptions and experiences of race, class, and change in their community. This study shows that statistical racial integration and perceptions of racial integration are two different factors. Residents define true racial integration as both residential and social. As a result, homeowners reported that their neighborhood is both segregated and integrated-a type of ``qualified'' integration. Perceptions of racial integration are also affected by inconsistently defined neighborhood boundaries and racial clustering, block by block.	1	Meghan Ashlin Rich
Brown, Keith. 2009. 'the Social Dynamics and Durability of Moral Boundaries.' Sociological Forum. 24:4 854-876.	Sociological Forum	2009	6	Moral boundaries are often conceptualized as an expression of an individual's identity or belief system. However, social forces greatly influence how and when consumers activate moral boundaries. Utilizing a dramaturgical perspective, this article shows that the activation of moral boundaries is largely determined by an individual's position in the market (role), the discourse he or she is expected to perform (scripts), and the individuals with whom he or she is interacting (audience). This article makes four contributions to our understanding of ethical consumption and boundary theory: (1) it provides a counterbalance to theories that imply moral boundaries are an expression of an individual's belief system; (2) it demonstrates the permeability of moral boundaries; (3) it shows that strong moral boundaries can, but rarely do, lead to the formation of social boundaries; and (4) it reinforces the notion that boundary research needs to include naturalistic data looking at how people activate boundaries in their everyday lives. These findings are based on participant observation and interviews with 102 consumers, activists, store owners, and managers of Fair Trade coffee and handicraft retail stores.	1	Keith R. Brown
Stuber, Jenny. 2009. 'Class, Culture, and Participation in the Collegiate Extra-curriculum.' Sociological Forum. 24:4 877-900.	Sociological Forum	2009	12	With larger percentages of high school students entering higher education, it becomes increasingly important to look at how processes occurring on college campuses contribute to social stratification. Using in-depth interviews with 61 students, I ask: How does social class structure students' participation in the collegiate extra-curriculum? I argue that the collegiate extra-curriculum is an important site for stratification because it is there that students gain access to social and cultural resources valued by the privileged classes. I find that upper-middle-class students arrive on campus with cultural resources that motivate their participation and social resources that facilitate their involvement. Among working-class students, limited financial factors constrain their involvement, while social and cultural resources further curtail their interest in such activities. These findings contribute to theories of social and cultural reproduction by showing that those who have more valued social and cultural resources at the outset are in a better position to gain additional such resources throughout their college careers. Moreover, these analyses show that symbolic and cultural hierarchies are sustained by the interdependent relationship between social and cultural capital.	1	Jenny M. Stuber
Grazian, David. 2009. 'Urban Nightlife, Social Capital, and the Public Life of Cities.' Sociological Forum. 24:4 908-917.	Sociological Forum	2009	3	Sociologists and urban scholars emphasize how nightlife establishments contribute to the social capital and public life of cities. In the interests of tempering this line of argument, I suggest three generalizable empirical findings that provide grounds for skepticism on this score: (1) the racial and class barriers to participation imposed by urban nightlife enterprises; (2) the normalization of gender differences and the routine harassment of women within such scenes; and (3) the lack of inclusiveness surrounding local nightlife in urban neighborhood communities. These findings suggest that nightlife scenes may function more efficiently as generators of bonding rather than bridging social capital.	1	David Grazian
Anderson, Tammy. 2009. 'Better to Complicate, Rather Than Homogenize, Urban Nightlife: a Response to Grazian.' Sociological Forum. 24:4 918-925.	Sociological Forum	2009	1	Grazian (2009) challenges a prominent narrative that claims urban nightlife is a democratized and social-capital-enriching ``third space'' of social life. For Grazian, urban nightlife is, instead, characterized by (1) race and class divisions, (2) gender inequities and the exploitation of women, and (3) exclusivity rather than inclusiveness or solidarity. Grazian makes a brief and compelling case. It is one I agree with to a certain point. However, in this essay, I present two major concerns with his argument.	1	Tammy L. Anderson
Steensland, Brian. 2009. 'Restricted and Elaborated Modes in the Cultural Analysis of Politics.' Sociological Forum. 24:4 926-934.	Sociological Forum	2009	4	The ``cultural turn'' that swept across the social sciences a generation ago ushered in renewed attention to the cultural analysis of politics. Yet despite this growing area of research, there remains a lack of integration between cultural and noncultural studies of political phenomena. Should this state of affairs be a source of concern for cultural sociologists? I believe it should be. In this essay, I outline reasons why this is the case and what might be done to address this issue. Drawing loosely on Basil Bernstein's distinction between ``restricted'' and ``elaborated'' codes, I suggest that cultural analyses of politics need to be more ``elaborated'' in nature and I offer three guidelines that can orient this type of research program.	1	Brian Steensland

These matters aside, the remarkable rise of cultural sociology in fact reflects adaptation to sociology's disciplinary norms and core thematic concerns. Steensland (2009) might better have reversed his argument: faced with the achievements of cultural analysis, the slumbering giant called ``mainstream sociology'' should wake up.	1	Philip Smith
Kretschmer, Kelsy. 2009. 'Contested Loyalties: Dissident Identity Organizations, Institutions, and Social Movements.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:4 433-454.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	3	In this article, the author investigates the innovative survival strategies of two organizations, both of which claim loyalty to parent institutions while simultaneously attempting to undermine those institutions in a larger political arena. The author asks how and why these organizations are able to maintain this precarious position. Findings indicate that the organizations manage to balance institutional insider and outsider status in three main ways: by reinterpreting key institutional texts in ways that support their own beliefs, by claiming to represent the majority of institutional membership, and by distancing themselves from the ``corrupted'' institutional elites. Their institutional loyalty claims help create a niche in a broader social movement and attracts support from external institutional opponents. But their dual identity also puts them at particular risk of being isolated from supportive communities. In general, these organizations shed light on the creative ways organizations can meet (sometimes) conflicting resource and legitimacy needs.	1	Kelsy Kretschmer
Kuipers, Kathy. 2009. 'Formal and Informal Network Coupling and Its Relationship to Workplace Attachment.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:4 455-479.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	2	This study examines how the overlap between informal and formal networks in the workplace is related to the degree of attachment for individuals in work organizations. Two types of informal networks, identified by their content and structure, are commonly found in work organizations: friendship networks and trust networks. Both the content of networks and the coupling (or overlap) of individual member networks with formal authority networks are important for two kinds of attachment, organizational identification and organizational internalization. Data from a survey of employees in five, small, start-up organizations were collected during 1997 and early 1998. Tight coupling between friendship networks and formal authority networks is found to have a strong positive relationship to organizational identification. Tight coupling between trust and formal authority networks is also found to be strongly and positively related to both organizational identification and internalization. Additionally, tight coupling between trust networks and formal authority networks is more influential in predicting identification than coupling between friendship networks and formal authority networks.	1	Kathy J.

Sociological Perspectives	2009	3	Employee turnover is of broad interest, and we focus on turnover in an occupational group that is appropriate for our theoretical approach: nursing home staff. Using a large and representative sample, we apply conceptual work in the area of social exchange by Lawler and colleagues to examine the role of affect toward the organization on employee turnover as well as antecedents of that affect. We use previous research and survey data to demonstrate that nursing home staff work in the conditions under which Lawler's theories of social exchange apply. We use longitudinal survey data to test whether nursing home staff turnover can be predicted by the level of affective attachment of the individual staff members to the nursing home, controlling for factors related to nursing home turnover. We find that lower nursing home staff turnover at Time 2 is predicted by affective attachment to the nursing home at Time 1.	2	Catherine Taylor; Karl Pillemer
McMahon-Howard, Jennifer, Jody Clay-Warner & Linda Renzulli. 2009. 'Criminalizing Spousal Rape: the Diffusion of Legal Reforms.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:4 505-531.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	3	While efforts to criminalize spousal rape began in the 1970s, by 2002 only twenty-three states had adopted laws that allow for the full prosecution of sexual assault by a spouse. The authors present the first analysis of martial rape law reform to incorporate insights from research on diffusion. The authors find that states are more likely to criminalize spousal rape when women in the state have more economic power. Conversely, states are less likely to criminalize spousal rape when the legislature passed previous incremental reforms or when a neighboring state already criminalized spousal rape. The authors also find that states that criminalize spousal rape under a split-party government are particularly influential in the spread of such reforms and that the processes driving early diffusion are different than the processes driving later diffusion. Overall, results suggest that understanding law reforms requires greater attention to incremental change, negative effects of spatial diffusion, and the importance of time.	3	Jennifer McMahon-Howard; Jody Clay-Warner; Linda Renzulli
Lizardo, Omar. 2009. 'Taking Cognitive Dualism Seriously: Revisiting the Durkheim-spencer Debate on the Rise of Individualism.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:4 533-555.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	2	The question of the extent to which Durkheim's argument in Division of Labor in Society is continuous with or radically departs from the work of Herbert Spencer has been the subject of a long-standing debate. In this article, the author revisits this issue in light of recent scholarship that points to the pervasive role of the notions of ``representation'' and ``dualism'' in Durkheim's overall thought. The analysis shows that Durkheim's conception of the rise of individualism is significantly different from that of Spencer, precisely because it is based on idiosyncratic concepts with no analogue in Spencer's system. Because of this difference, Durkheim's critique of Spencer largely misses the mark and in fact requires an ambiguous projection of Durkheim's own theory-laden notion of individualism toward Spencer, in order to suggest that Spencer begs the question. The author concludes that Durkheim and Spencer had largely incommensurable ideas as to the primary consequence of the division of labor: the rise of ``individualism.'' This necessitates the analytical distinction between the two conceptions of `` the individual,'' which I label the ``bio-psychological'' and the ``sociological.''	1	Omar Lizardo
Whitmeyer, Joseph. 2009. 'the Perils of Assuming a Single Equilibrium.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:4 557-579.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	1	Most techniques sociologists use to analyze empirical phenomena make the single equilibrium assumption that a given configuration of independent variables will produce a single outcome. The author uses two simple models to show that when the assumption does not hold, such techniques may be inadequate. The assumption, moreover, may not be valid for many social phenomena. To show this, the author takes two recent published examples of work that assumes a single equilibrium and presents models of the phenomena that suggest that assumption may not hold. The consequence of analysis that erroneously assumes a single equilibrium may be a fundamental misunderstanding of the phenomenon in question and faulty policy conclusions.	1	Joseph Whitmeyer
Lopez, Steven, Randy Hodson & Vincent Roscigno. 2009. 'Power, Status, and Abuse at Work: General and Sexual Harassment Compared.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:1 3-27.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	6	Workplace harassment can be devastating for employees and damaging for organizations. In this article, we expand the literature by identifying common and distinct processes related to general workplace harassment and workplace sexual harassment. Using both structural equation modeling and in-depth case immersion, we analyze content-coded data from the full population of workplace ethnographies-ethnographies that provide in-depth information on the nature and causes of both general and sexual harassment that would otherwise be difficult to gather. Importantly, both forms of harassment emerge in settings characterized by physically demanding work and minority work groups. In such contexts, both general and sexual harassment enforce formal and informal status hierarchies and social exclusion. Grievance mechanisms and ``team models'' of workplace organization reduce sexual harassment but have no effect on general harassment. We conclude with a discussion of theoretical, legal, and policy implications for identifying and remedying harassment as a widespread and devastating form of inequality and social exclusion in organizations.	3	Steven H.

Existent research highlights both potentially positive and negative experiences among women involved in exotic dance. In this article, we focus on the social organization of strip clubs and how this organization contextualizes the experiences and commitments of dancers. We present ethnographic data collected by the first author, including extensive field observations of 49 strip clubs, formal interviews from 50 dancers and ex-dancers at various career stages, and informal interviews with dozens of other dancers. We present a typology of strip clubs-hustle clubs, social clubs, and show clubs-and describe the processual orders. We also explain how the processual orders of these different types of clubs relate to dancers' workplace experiences. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for sociological and public understandings of sex work.	2	Mindy S. Bradley-Engen; Jeffery T. Ulmer

The empirical context of this study is a random sample of urban lawyers in Chicago. The findings indicate that a lawyer benefits not only from having access to social capital that provides timely and novel information related to solving work-related tasks, but also from the endorsement by high-status network partners. In addition, empirical analyses reveal that the returns on ties to high-status others, net of control, and other social capital variables vary according to the level of client uncertainty in the market.	1	Harris H.

Sociological Quarterly	2009	1	Much of the sociological and historical literature, ignoring long-standing interclass disputes over integration, takes for granted that during the 1950s, all blacks, parents, and members of civil rights organizations included, sought desegregation. This article examines the interests of different segments of New York City's black community regarding the public schools during that era. I use contemporary newspaper accounts of protests and more recent theoretical insights to analyze and interpret differences in expressed goals and demands. This article not only documents considerable educationally oriented protest in a Northern city during a decade often overlooked by scholars, but highlights important class-based differences within a single city's black community regarding changes needed. Of particular interest to social movement scholars are findings that reveal a large disjuncture between the demands of the grassroots parents' organizations and established, elite civil rights organizations. While civil rights organizations sought abstract ideals of integration, parents demanded tangible improvements in their children's schools. Class-based cultures and experiences are posited as the root of this disjuncture.	1	Melissa F. Weiner

Sociological Quarterly. 50:1 121-143.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	7	Studying interracial romance has been useful for understanding general race relations. Theories of African American alienation and social dominance orientation help explain why previous research has found African Americans to be the least desired racial dating partners. Alienation predicts that African Americans are less willing to interracially date than other racial groups since they are not allowed to participate in the majority culture. Social dominance orientation predicts that African Americans are more willing to interracially date than other racial groups because they occupy the lowest position in our racial hierarchy. This study utilizes an Internet dating website to explore the racial dating preferences of European Americans, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Asian Americans. The theory of African American alienation is upheld, as African Americans are generally less willing to interracially date than other races and are especially less willing to date European Americans.	1	George Yancey
Hong, Wei & John Walsh. 2009. 'for Money or Glory? Commercialization, Competition, and Secrecy in the Entrepreneurial University.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:1 145-171.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	14	Scholars have grown concerned that the commercialization of academic science is increasing secrecy at the expense of cooperation and information sharing. Using data from comparable surveys of academic scientists in three fields (experimental biology, mathematics, and physics), we test whether scientists have become more competitive and more secretive over the last 30 years. We also use the recent survey to test a multivariate model of the effects of scientific competition and commercialization (patenting, industry funding, and industry collaboration) on scientific secrecy. We find that secrecy has increased, and has increased particularly for experimental biologists. Only 13 percent of experimental biologists in 1998 felt safe discussing their ongoing research with all others doing similar work. Our multivariate analysis shows that this secrecy is most related to concerns about being anticipated (scientific competition). We find that patenting is associated with increased secrecy among mathematicians and physicists, but not for experimental biologists. We find that industry funding is associated with more secrecy, while industry collaboration is associated with less secrecy, across fields. Our results suggest that the recent concern over increasing scientific secrecy has merit. However, this increased secrecy seems to result from a combination of increasing commercial linkages and increased pressures from scientific competition. Our research highlights the central role that scientists' competition for priority plays in the system of science and that, while such competition spurs effort, it also produces negative effects that recent trends toward commercialization of academic science seem to be exacerbating.	2	Wei Hong; John P.

'Why Does Cultural Capital Matter for High School Academic Performance? an Empirical Assessment of Teacher-selection and Self-selection Mechanisms as Explanations of the Cultural Capital Effect.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:1 173-200.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	9	Many scholars have argued that students' cultural capital has a positive effect on academic performance because students with cultural capital have better relationships with their teachers (the ``teacher-selection'' effect). However, theory also points to the importance of a ``self-selection'' effect, whereby students' cultural capital has a positive effect on academic performance by enhancing students' expectations for future educational attainment. Using National Education Longitudinal Study data, I estimate structural equation models to empirically assess the extent to which teachers' perceptions of students and educational expectations act as mechanisms of the cultural capital effect on grades and standardized test scores. The results show that, contrary to theoretical expectations, teachers' perceptions do not mediate the effect of cultural capital on academic performance. However, educational expectations account for portions of the cultural capital effect on grades and test scores.	1	Tina Wildhagen

Sociological Theory	2009	2	This study investigates a practice that allows workers based in India to work online on projects for corporations in the United States, representing a new mode of labor integration. In the absence of direct bureaucratic control across continents, the question arises how this rapidly growing labor practice is organized. The riddle of organizational governance is solved through an analysis of software programming schemes, which are presented as the key to organizing globally dispersed labor through data servers. This labor integration through programming code is distinguished from two other systems of organization-bureaucracy and the market-while bringing out the salient features of each system in terms of its ruling principle: bureaucracy (legal-rational), the market (price), and algocracy (programming or algorithm). The logic of algocratic systems is explored methodically to analyze global work.	1	A. Aneesh
Jerolmack, Colin. 2009. 'Humans, Animals, and Play: Theorizing Interaction When Intersubjectivity Is Problematic.' Sociological Theory. 27:4 371-389.	Sociological Theory	2009	5	Simmel (1949) argues that humans have an ``impulse'' toward sociability, defined as noninstrumental, playful association that is enjoyed as an end in itself. While sociability as conceived of by Simmel necessitates a shared definition of the situation, recent studies problematize symbolic interactionist assumptions by documenting the ways humans engage in analogous sociable play with animals. Drawing from ethnomethodological and pragmatist perspectives, this article offers a way to theorize human-animal encounters and their relationship to interactions among humans. Beginning with a conceptualization of play as an interpretive frame (Goffman 1986) that actors can employ to organize situated interactions, this article argues that humans can engage in playful associations with animals even if animals do not share in the play frame. It illustrates how play with animals can preserve some of the forms and satisfactions of interaction with humans, and it clarifies how interaction can be coordinated and understood when we cannot assume that interactants share intersubjectivity. The article concludes by offering a tentative set of conditions that structure the possibilities of sociable play, based on the degree of potential intersubjectivity and other situational factors.	1	Colin Jerolmack
Hopcroft, Rosemary. 2009. 'the Evolved Actor in Sociology.' Sociological Theory. 27:4 390-406.	Sociological Theory	2009	0	In this article, I show that principles from both evolutionary biology and evolutionary psychology inform a model of the actor that is usually implicit in sociological research on the family and social stratification. Making this evolved actor model explicit can unify and explain existing empirical sociological findings in these areas, and suggest new hypotheses for future research. I suggest the same is true in many other areas of sociology as well, and that explicitly incorporating a fully developed evolved actor model into sociology can both unify the discipline and reconnect it with the other life sciences.	1	Rosemary L.

Campbell, Colin. 2009. 'Distinguishing the Power of Agency From Agentic Power: a Note on Weber and the ``black Box'' of Personal Agency*.' Sociological Theory. 27:4 407-418.	Sociological Theory	2009	3	The concept of agency, although central to many sociological debates, has remained frustratingly elusive to pin down. This article is an attempt to open up what has been called the ``black box'' of personal agency by distinguishing clearly between two contrasting conceptions of the phenomenon. These two conceptions are very apparent in the manner in which the concept is defined in sociological reference works, resembling as it does a similar contrast in the treatment of the concept of power. The two are referred to as type 1 and type 2 or the power of agency as compared with agentic power, the essential contrast being that the first refers to an actor's ability to initiate and maintain a program of action while the second refers to an actor's ability to act independently of the constraining power of social structure. The nature of these two forms of personal agency is then illustrated by referring to material taken from Weber's essay The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, this essay itself being understood as an argument that focuses on the crucial role played by an increase in the power of agency in ushering in the modern world. Finally, it is argued that these two conceptions of agency possess no given logical relationship with each other, it being perfectly possible for individuals to be possessed of considerable power of agency while lacking agentic power, and vice versa. It is therefore concluded that it is important, in all discussions of human agency, to distinguish clearly between these two forms.	1	Colin Campbell

Through a discussion of the literature of economic sociology on status and Fligstein's political-cultural approach, I argue that this concept can be a source of fresh insights into empirical problems. I find that the greater the change in the social environment, the more salient the benefits of using habitus as a tool to analyze agents' behavior.	1	Francois Collet

Sociological Theory	2009	2	Focusing on Mind, Self and Society, I contend that George Herbert Mead's theory is incapable of explaining the interactions in a song by Oscar Brown Jr., ``The Snake,'' and that a satisfactory explanation of these actions, which illuminate everyday conduct familiar to us all, requires the conceptualization of personality systems grounded in affect and cultural systems understood as symbolic logics that make intelligible certain activities. My argument is important not primarily as a critique of Mead, but of rational-choice and other cognitive theories that reduce emotions to cognitions, and of the currently dominant sociological and anthropological conceptualizations that reduce culture to forms of social practice.	1	Mark Gould
Abrutyn, Seth. 2009. 'Toward a General Theory of Institutional Autonomy.' Sociological Theory. 27:4 449-465.	Sociological Theory	2009	3	Institutional differentiation has been one of the central concerns of sociology since the days of Auguste Comte. However, the overarching tendency among institutionalists such as Durkheim or Spencer has been to treat the process of differentiation from a macro, ``outside in'' perspective. Missing from this analysis is how institutional differentiation occurs from the ``inside out,'' or through the efforts and struggles of individual and corporate actors. Despite the recent efforts of the ``new institutionalism'' to fill in this gap, a closer look at the literature will uncover the fact that (1) it has tended to conflate macro-level institutions and meso-level organizations and (2) this has led to a taken for granted approach to institutional dynamics. This article seeks to develop a general theory of institutional autonomy; autonomy is a function of the degree to which specialized corporate units are structurally and symbolically independent of other corporate units. It is argued herein that the process by which these ``institutional entrepreneurs'' become independent can explain how institutions become differentiated from the ``inside out.'' Moreover, this article offers five dimensions that can be operationalized, measuring the degree to which institutions are autonomous.	1	Seth Abrutyn
Santos, Martin. 2009. 'Fact-totems and the Statistical Imagination: the Public Life of a Statistic in Argentina 2001.' Sociological Theory. 27:4 466-489.	Sociological Theory	2009	3	Statistics are key elements of contemporary life. They figure prominently in the media, in political discourse, and in daily conversations. They also weigh heavily within the economic and political spheres of modern societies. Yet, the study of statistics in the public sphere has been neglected by social scientists in favor of a focus on their production and history. This article remedies this lacuna by focusing on the public life of statistics. Through a case study of a financial indicator-country risk-that exhibited a rich public life in Argentina in 2001, it argues that statistics are not simply transparent fragments of information, but rich symbols and collective representations able to condense multiple meanings and generate deep emotional reactions. Using in-depth interviews, newspaper covers, headlines, and leads, cartoons and archival materials, this article shows that country risk became a powerful collective representation and introduces a new concept, the fact-totem, to make visible the cultural life of statistics. A fact-totem is a statistic with high media presence that captures the imagination of diverse publics and becomes articulated with basic identity narratives of a collectivity.

Sociology of Religion. 70:4 343-361.	Sociology of Religion	2009	0	The story of declining rural churches is a powerful one. A story of declining rural churches in declining communities is engaging on both the cognitive and emotional levels and leads the hearer into the powerful narrative of modernization. Yet, it is a story that neglects the migration trends into more rural areas. I argue that narrative of declining rural churches is a story about moral order, an emotional story imbued with a sense of loss for a world inconsistent with the world in which most of us live our lives. I suggest that the persistence of this story is an expression of the ambivalence some people feel about modern life, as they choose new ways of doing things that work for them, but at the same time, imagine a loss of the emotional connection embedded in the old ways. I suggest we move to thinking about these individual rural communities as borderlands in the way that Gloria Anzaldua uses the term, and to describe what happens in communities-when established residents invite newcomers into their churches-as encounters. Furthermore, I show that how the work of ethnographers takes place inside of the borderland, and is part of the process of encounter. Finally, I argue that for all participants, encounters bring with them the possibility of change.	1	Mary Jo Neitz
Scheitle, Christopher. 2009. '2007 Robert J-mcnamara Student Paper Award Winnerleadership Compensation in Christian Nonprofits*.' Sociology of Religion. 70:4 384-408.	Sociology of Religion	2009	0	Christian nonprofits have an important place in the religious landscape of the United States. They are providing a wide range of goods and services to individuals, congregations, and even denominations. Despite their substantial and growing influence, we know little about how these organizations are using the billions of dollars they collectively receive. I examine one issue that is frequently of interest to both scholars and the public. Using new data on over 1,900 Christian nonprofits, the analysis looks at leadership compensation in these organizations. I focus on how organizational resources, internal and external monitoring, and leadership power influence whether and how much Christian nonprofits compensate their leaders. Resources and leadership power are found to be positively associated with the amount of compensation given to leaders in Christian nonprofits, while monitoring does not have a significant association.	1	Christopher P.

Ellison, Christopher, Wei Zhang, Neal Krause & John Marcum. 2009. 'Does Negative Interaction in the Church Increase Psychological Distress? Longitudinal Findings From the Presbyterian Panel Survey*.' Sociology of Religion. 70:4 409-431.	Sociology of Religion	2009	3	This study examines the effects of negative interaction in church on psychological distress. After outlining a series of theoretical arguments linking negative interaction with health and well-being, relevant hypotheses are tested using longitudinal data from two surveys of the 1997-1999 Presbyterian Panel, a nationwide panel of members and elders (lay leaders) in congregations of the Presbyterian Church (USA). Findings confirm that negative interaction appears to foster or exacerbate distress over the study period. In addition, specific dimensions of social negativity have distinctive effects; the impact of criticisms on distress surface only in cross-sectional models, while the effects of excessive demands emerge only in the longitudinal models. No subgroup variations in these effects are detected. Implications of these findings are discussed with regard to (a) research on religion and health and (b) congregational life, and a number of promising directions for future research are elaborated.	4	Christopher G.

Mermis-Cava, Jonathan. 2009. 'an Anchor and a Sail: Christian Meditation as the Mechanism for a Pluralist Religious Identity.' Sociology of Religion. 70:4 432-453.	Sociology of Religion	2009	0	This study examines the religious identity project of an interdenominational association of Christians who practice a ritual called ``Christian Meditation.'' While maintaining denominational affiliation, Christian meditators also employ the symbolic boundary of religious pluralism to demarcate their religious identity. They must therefore balance their sense of openness with denominational commitment. Within their identification as Christian meditators, these individuals not only surmount this challenge, but paradoxically also enhance and increase denominational activity. This paper utilizes data from participant observation, in-depth interviews, and supplementary sources to explain how this is accomplished. Compared with Dillon's (Michele Dillon, 1999. Catholic Identity: Balancing Reason, Faith, and Power. New York: Cambridge University Press) finding that ``core'' traditions can be used to transform religious identity, I argue that the ``invented tradition'' (Eric Hobsbawn. 1983. ``Introduction: Inventing Traditions.'' The Invention of Tradition, edited by E. Hobsbawn and T. Ranger. New York: Cambridge University Press, pp. 1-14) of Christian Meditation also serves this purpose. Via its multidimensional structure of meaning, the ritual simultaneously operates as an anchor that maintains, enhances, and promotes denominational activity and a sail that allows institutional boundaries to be crossed.	1	Jonathan Mermis-Cava
Grip, Richard. 2009. 'Does Projecting Enrollments by Race Produce More Accurate Results in New Jersey School Districts?.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:6 747-771.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	0	Since different races have unique fertility rates and migration patterns, performing school district enrollment projections by race and aggregating to a total may be more accurate than performing enrollment projections with all races combined. Twelve school districts in New Jersey of varying overall size and majority race percentages were used in this study to determine whether projecting enrollment by race or with all races combined is more accurate. Using historical enrollment data for a five-year period, the Cohort-Survival Ratio method was employed to project enrollment for a four-year period, 2003-04 through 2006-07. Projected enrollments were compared to actual enrollments in each district for both methods used for the purpose of determining whether district building capacity would be exceeded. Enrollments computed were district totals and enrollment by elementary, middle, and high school configurations. Percent differences were calculated for each district for the projection time period. The results showed that the projections with all races combined had lower percent differences as compared to the projections that were performed by race, particularly for smaller districts. However, the findings also showed that projecting enrollment by race might be suitable for larger districts with low majority race percentages. The results also demonstrated that projections by race are greater in magnitude than those projections performed with all races combined, which corroborates an earlier assertion by Keyfitz.	1	Richard S.

Kellogg, Katherine. 2009. 'Operating Room: Relational Spaces and Microinstitutional Change in Surgery.' American Journal of Sociology. 115:3 657-711.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	39	One of the great paradoxes of institutional change is that even when top managers in organizations provide support for change in response to new regulation, the employees whom new programs are designed to benefit often do not use them. This 15-month ethnographic study of two hospitals responding to new regulation demonstrates that using these programs may require subordinate employees to challenge middle managers with opposing interests. The article argues that relational spaces-areas of isolation, interaction, and inclusion that allow middle-manager reformers and subordinate employees to develop a cross-position collective for change-are critical to the change process. These findings have implications for research on institutional change and social movements.	1	Katherine C. Kellogg

American Journal of Sociology	2009	7	Based on more than 14 months' ethnographic research in China, this article brings in culture and symbolic interactionism to understand the social embeddedness of economic transactions. First, an analytic frame linking tie strengths to defining principles, relational properties, and interactions is constructed and applied to changes in life insurance transactions in China. The data suggest that strong tie transactions were common until the economic gains of the sellers were made public. The author argues that the ethical-affective principle that defines strong ties and the high intensity of trust, affection, and asymmetric obligation that constitute these ties make them a double-edged sword for economic transactions. Instead, ties with midrange or weak strength are more effective because of their relational complementarity (although direct economic exchanges may take place among strong ties under extreme institutional or contingency conditions). The author also reveals that dramaturgical interactions, through which economic actors exercise their agency, are an integral part of embedded transactions.	1	Cheris Shun-ching Chan

American Journal of Sociology	2009	11	Although many sociologists are strongly wedded to the idea of ``social construction,'' the contextual factors that influence the magnitude of construction are rarely considered. This article explores the decoupling of an actor's status from the actor's underlying quality and examines the factors that influence the magnitude of decoupling. The authors specifically consider the role of quality uncertainty, diffuse status characteristics, and the self-fulfilling prophecy. To analyze the impact of each mechanism on decoupling, they simulate the evolution of thousands of small groups using a dyadic model of status allocation. The authors discuss the results of these simulations and conclude with the implications for future research and the practical management of groups.	3	Freda B. Lynn; Joel M. Podolny; Lin Tao

American Journal of Sociology	2009	4	The relative income or income status hypothesis implies that people should be happier when they live among the poor. Findings on neighborhood effects suggest, however, that living in a poorer neighborhood reduces, not enhances, a person's happiness. Using data from the American National Election Study linked to income data from the U.S. census, the authors find that Americans tend to be happier when they reside in richer neighborhoods (consistent with neighborhood studies) in poorer counties (as predicted by the relative income hypothesis). Thus it appears that individuals in fact are happier when they live among the poor, as long as the poor do not live too close.	2	Glenn Firebaugh; Matthew B. Schroeder
Mark, Noah, Lynn Smith-Lovin & Cecilia Ridgeway. 2009. 'Why Do Nominal Characteristics Acquire Status Value? a Minimal Explanation for Status Construction.' American Journal of Sociology. 115:3 832-862.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	5	Why do beliefs that attach different amounts of status to different categories of people become consensually held by the members of a society? We show that two microlevel mechanisms, in combination, imply a system-level tendency toward consensual status beliefs about a nominal characteristic. (1) Status belief diffusion: a person who has no status belief about a characteristic can acquire a status belief about that characteristic from interacting with one or more people who have that status belief. (2) Status belief loss: a person who has a status belief about a characteristic can lose that belief from interacting with one or more people who have the opposite status belief. These mechanisms imply that opposite status beliefs will tend to be lost at equal rates and will tend to be acquired at rates proportional to their prevalence. Therefore, if a status belief ever becomes more prevalent than its opposite, it will increase in prevalence until every person holds it.	3	Noah P. Mark; Lynn Smith-Lovin; Cecilia L. Ridgeway

American Journal of Sociology	2009	24	Why are some nations more religious than others? This article proposes a multilevel framework in which country differences in religious attendance are explained by contextual, individual, and cross-level interaction effects. Hypotheses from different theories are simultaneously tested with data from 60 nations obtained from the European/World Values Surveys. Multilevel logistic regression analyses show that religious regulation in a country diminishes religious attendance and that there are only small negative effects of people's own education and average educational level of the country. Religious attendance is strongly affected by personal and societal insecurities and by parental and national religious socialization and level of urbanization. These theories explain 75\% of the cross-national variation in religious attendance.	2	Stijn Ruiter; Frank Tubergen
Bozzoli, Carlos, Angus Deaton & Climent Quintana-Domeque. 2009. 'Adult Height and Childhood Disease.' Demography. 46:4 647-669.	Demography	2009	26	Taller populations are typically richer populations, and taller individuals live longer and earn more. In consequence, adult height has recently become a focus in understanding the relationship between health and wealth. We investigate the childhood determinants of population adult height, focusing on the respective roles of income and of disease. Across a range of European countries and the United States, we find a strong inverse relationship between postneonatal (ages I month to I year) mortality, interpreted as a measure of the disease and nutritional burden in childhood, and the mean height of those children as adults. Consistent with these findings, we develop a model of selection and stunting in which the early-life burden of undernutrition and disease not only is responsible for mortality in childhood but also leaves a residue of long-term health risks for survivors, risks that express themselves in adult height and in late-life disease. The model predicts that at sufficiently high mortality levels, selection can dominate scarring, leaving a taller population of survivors. We find evidence of this effect in the poorest and highest-mortality countries of the world, supplementing recent findings on the effects of the Great Chinese Famine.	3	Carlos Bozzoli; Angus Deaton; Climent Quintana-Domeque
Jackson, Margot. 2009. 'Understanding Links Between Adolescent Health and Educational Attainment.' Demography. 46:4 671-694.	Demography	2009	16	The educational and economic consequences of poor health during childhood and adolescence have become increasingly clear, with a resurgence of evidence leading researchers to reconsider the potentially significant contribution of early-life health to population welfare both within and across generations. Meaningful relationships between early-life health and educational attainment raise important questions about how health may influence educational success in young adulthood and beyond, as well as for whom its influence is strongest. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, 1 examine how adolescents' health and social status act together to create educational disparities in young adulthood, focusing on two questions in particular. First, does the link between adolescent health and educational attainment vary across socioeconomic and racial/ethnic groups? Second, what academic factors explain the connection between adolescent health and educational attainment? The findings suggest that poorer health in adolescence is strongly negatively related to educational attainment, net of both observed confounders and unobserved, time-invariant characteristics within households. The reduction in attainment is particularly large for non-Hispanic while adolescents, suggesting that the negative educational consequences of poor health are not limited to only the most socially disadvantaged adolescents. Finally, I find that the link between adolescent health and educational attainment is explained by academic factors related to educational participation and, most importantly, academic performance, rather than by reduced educational expectations. These findings add complexity to our understanding of how the educational consequences of poor health apply across the social hierarchy, as well as why poor health may lead adolescents to complete less schooling.	1	Margot I.

Sabia, Joseph & Daniel Rees. 2009. 'the Effect of Sexual Abstinence on Females' Educational Attainment.' Demography. 46:4 695-715.	Demography	2009	6	A number of studies have shown that teenagers who abstain from sex are more likely to graduate from high school and attend college than their sexually active peers. However it is unclear whether this association represents a causal relationship or can be explained by unmeasured heterogeneity We employ a variety of statistical techniques to distinguish between these hypotheses, using data on females from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Our results provide evidence that delaying first intercourse leads to an increased likelihood of graduating from high school. This relationship appears to be strongest among respondents in the bottom third of the ability distribution. Controlling for fertility reduces, but does not eliminate, the estimated effect of delaying intercourse.	2	Joseph J. Sabia; Daniel I. Rees
Sandoval, Daniel, Mark Rank & Thomas Hirschl. 2009. 'the Increasing Risk of Poverty Across the American Life Course.' Demography. 46:4 717-737.	Demography	2009	8	This article extends the emerging body of life course research on poverty by empirically identifying the incidence, chronicity, and age pattern of American poverty and how these dimensions have changed during the period 1968-2000. Using the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we construct a series of life tables that estimate the risk of poverty for adults during their 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, and 70s, and compare these estimates for Americans in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. Our empirical results suggest that the risk of acute poverty increased substantially, particularly in the 1990s. This observed increase was especially pronounced for individuals in their 20s, 30s, and 40s; for all age groups with respect to extreme poverty and for white males. On the other hand, the risk of chronic poverty declined during the 1990s (as measured by the percentage of the poor who experienced five or more years of poverty within a 10-year interval). The results in this article tell a very different story than the Census Bureau yearly cross-sectional rates, which have shown little overall change in the U.S. poverty rate during this 30-year period. In contrast, a life course approach reveals a rising economic risk of acute poverty for individuals, one that is consistent with recent observations and research suggesting that a growing number of Americans will eventually find themselves in an economically precarious position.	3	Daniel A.

Moehling, Carolyn & Anne Piehl. 2009. 'Immigration, Crime, and Incarceration in Early Twentieth-century America.' Demography. 46:4 739-763.	Demography	2009	5	The major government commissions on immigration and crime in the early twentieth century relied on evidence that suffered from aggregation bias and the absence of accurate population data, which led them to present partial and sometimes misleading views of the immigrant-native criminality comparison. With improved data and methods, we find that in 1904, prison commitment rates for more serious crimes were quite similar by nativity for all ages except ages 18 and 19, for which the commitment rate for immigrants was higher than for the native-born. By 1930, immigrants were less likely than natives to be committed to prisons at all ages 20 and older, but this advantage disappears when one looks at commitments for violent offenses. The time series pattern reflects a growing gap between natives and immigrants at older ages, one that was driven by sharp increases in the commitment rates of the native-born, while commitment rates for the foreign-born were remarkably stable.	2	Carolyn Moehling; Anne Morrison Piehl
Hayford, Sarah. 2009. 'the Evolution of Fertility Expectations Over the Life Course.' Demography. 46:4 765-783.	Demography	2009	10	In low-fertility contexts, how many children people have is largely a product of how many children they want. However, the social, institutional, and individual factors that influence how many children people want are not well understood. In particular, there is scant evidence about how fertility expectations change over the life course. This article provides an empirical description of changes in women's expected fertility over the entire span of childbearing years. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979 cohort, group-based trajectory analysis illuminates common patterns in the evolution of fertility intentions and identifies individual characteristics associated with these patterns. Factors related to family formation, such as marriage and whether a woman has a child at an early age, are found to be the most consistent correlates of patterns of change in expected family size.	1	Sarah R.

Raymo, James, Miho Iwasawa & Larry Bumpass. 2009. 'Cohabitation and Family Formation in Japan.' Demography. 46:4 785-803.	Demography	2009	7	This article documents the prevalence, duration, and marital outcomes of cohabiting unions in Japan. It then examines the correlates of cohabitation experiences and also describes differences in the family-formation trajectories of women who have and have not cohabited Cohabitation has increased rapidly among recent cohorts of women, and cohabiting unions in Japan tend to be relatively short in duration and are almost as likely to dissolve as to result in marriage. Life table analyses demonstrate that the cumulative probabilities of marriage and parenthood within marriage are roughly similar for women who did and those who did not cohabit. The most notable difference is in the pathways to family formation, with women who cohabited more likely both to marry subsequent to pregnancy and to delay childbearing within marriage. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that cohabiting unions in Japan are best viewed as an emerging prelude to marriage rather than as an alternative to marriage or singlehood. We conclude with speculation about the likelihood of further increases in cohabitation in Japan and the potential implications for marriage and fertility.	3	James M.

Hildebrand, Vincent & Philippe Van. 2009. 'Income Inequality and Self-rated Health Status: Evidence From the European Community Household Panel.' Demography. 46:4 805-825.	Demography	2009	9	We examine the effect of income inequality on individuals' self-rated health status in a pooled sample of 11 Countries, using longitudinal data from the European Community Household Panel survey. Taking advantage of the longitudinal and cross-national nature of our data, and carefully modeling the self-reported health information, we avoid several of the pitfalls suffered by earlier studies on this topic. We calculate income inequality indices measured at two standard levels of geography (NUTS-0 and NUTS-1) and find consistent evidence that income inequality is negatively related to self-rated health status in the European Union for both men and women, particularly when measured at national level. However, despite its statistical significance, the magnitude of the impact of inequality on health is very small.	2	Vincent Hildebrand; Philippe Van
Poel, Ellen, Owen O'Donnell & Eddy Van. 2009. 'What Explains the Rural-urban Gap in Infant Mortality: Household or Community Characteristics?.' Demography. 46:4 827-850.	Demography	2009	7	The rural-urban gap in infant mortality rates is explained by using a new decomposition method that permits identification of the contribution of unobserved heterogeneity at the household and the community level. Using Demographic and Health Survey data for six Francophone countries in Central and West sub-Saharan Africa, we find that differences in the distributions of factors that determine mortality-not differences in their effects-explain almost the entire gap. Higher infant mortality rates in rural areas mainly derive from the rural disadvantage in household characteristics, both observed and unobserved, which explain two-thirds of the gap. Among the observed characteristics, environmental factors-a safe source of drinking water, electricity, and quality of housing materials-are the most important contributors. Community characteristics explain less than one-quarter of the gap, with about two-thirds of this coming from community unobserved heterogeneity and one-third from the existence of a health facility within the community. The effect of disadvantageous environmental conditions-such as limited electricity and water supply-derives both from a lack of community-level infrastructure and from the inability of some households to exploit it when available. Policy needs to operate at both the community and household levels to correct such deficiencies.	3	Ellen Poel; Owen O'Donnell; Eddy Van
Mehta, Neil & Virginia Chang. 2009. 'Mortality Attributable to Obesity Among Middle-aged Adults in the United States.' Demography. 46:4 851-872.	Demography	2009	22	Obesity is considered a major cause of premature mortality and a potential threat to the long-standing secular decline in mortality in the United States. We measure relative and attributable risks associated with obesity among middle-aged adults using data from the Health and Retirement Study (1992-2004). Although class II/III obesity (BMI >= 35.0 kg/m(2)) increases mortality by 40\% in females and 62\% in males compared with normal BMI (BMI = 18.5-24.9), class I obesity (BMI = 30.0-34.9) and being overweight (BM] = 25.0-29.9) are not associated with excess mortality. With respect to attributable mortality, class II/III obesity (BMI >= 35.0) is responsible for approximately 4\% of deaths among females and 3\% of deaths among males. Obesity is often compared with cigarette smoking as a major source of avoidable mortality. Smoking-attributable mortality is much larger in this cohort: about 36\% in females and 50\% in males. Results are robust to confounding by preexisting diseases, multiple dimensions of socioeconomic status (SES), smoking, and other correlates. These findings challenge the viewpoint that obesity will stem the long-term secular decline in U.S. mortality	2	Neil K. Mehta; Virginia W. Chang

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	1	The relationship between female African American primary caregivers' racial identity and their racial socialization emphases was examined. Three components of racial identity were evaluated: (1) the importance of race to the self-concept (centrality), (2) affective feelings toward group membership (private regard), and (3) perceptions of how group members are perceived by nonmembers (public regard). Latent class cluster analysis was used to identify racial identity profiles, or dominant combinations of racial centrality, private regard, and public regard among a sample of 208 female African American primary caregivers. Mean differences in the content of caregivers' socialization emphases by profile group were then assessed. Findings indicated that caregivers with different identity profiles emphasized different messages. These findings and their implications are discussed.	2	Krista Maywalt Scottham; Ciara P. Smalls

Individuals who have parents from different racial/ethnic groups were invited to complete questionnaires on their family experiences.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	1	Using longitudinal data from the Woodlawn Project (N = 680), this study examined how patterns of living arrangements among a community cohort of African American mothers were associated with later physical and emotional health. We identified eight patterns of stability and transition in living arrangements during the childrearing years. Health outcomes include SF-36 Physical Functioning, SF-36 Bodily Pain, depressed mood, and anxious mood. Specific patterns of living arrangements were related to later health, controlling for age, earlier health, education, and poverty. Poverty explained many, but not all, of the relationships between living arrangements and health. Findings underscored the benefits of social support and social integration and highlighted the negative effects of marital dissolution on health.	7	Kate E. Fothergill; Margaret E. Ensminger; Kerry M.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	6	In this longitudinal study, we investigated the mechanisms by which Chinese American parents' experiences of discrimination influenced their adolescents' ethnicity-related stressors (i.e., cultural misfit, discrimination, attitudes toward education). We focused on whether parents' ethnic-racial socialization practices and perpetual foreigner stress moderated or mediated this relationship. Participants were 444 Chinese American families. Results indicated no evidence of moderation, but we observed support for mediation. Parental experiences of discrimination were associated with more ethnic-racial socialization practices and greater parental perpetual foreigner stress. More ethnic-racial socialization was related to greater cultural misfit in adolescents, whereas more perpetual foreigner stress was related to adolescents' poorer attitudes toward education and more reported discrimination. Relationships between mediators and outcomes were stronger for fathers than for mothers.	2	Aprile D. Benner; Su Yeong Kim

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	0	We investigated the widely held premise that welfare participation causes women to refrain from marriage. Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 3,219), we employed an event history approach to study transitions to marriage among mothers who have had a nonmarital birth. We found that welfare participation reduces the likelihood of transitioning to marriage (hazard ratio is 0.67, p < .01), but only while the mother is receiving benefits. Once the mother leaves welfare, past receipt has little effect on marriage. We infer that the negative association between welfare participation and subsequent marriage reflects temporary economic disincentives rather than an erosion of values.	4	Julien O. Teitler; Nancy E.

Parental cohesion and family cohesion, warmth, structure, and problem solving were assessed via behavioral observation during family problem-solving discussions and parent-child teaching interactions 18-24 months after the OHI. Results indicated that the marital bond was predictive of parental cohesion, family cohesion, warmth, and structure during teaching interactions. The marital bond was not significantly predictive of family problem solving or parental cohesion in problem-solving interactions.	4	Eve-Anne M. Doohan; Sybil Carrere; Chelsea Siler; Cheryl Beardslee

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	1	Much research has argued for the existence of a marriage benefit to men, women, and children. Although the commonly suggested current response to a husband's violence has been for the couple to separate, traditionally women were often told to ``stay for the children.'' This paper uses the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods longitudinal data to examine the relationships among marital stability, husband violence, and children's behavior problems. Among married mothers who reported husband violence at time 1 (N = 414), the negative relationship between child behavior problems and remaining in the marriage dissipated when selection bias and husband violence recidivism were controlled.	1	Clifton R.

Vaaler, Margaret, Christopher Ellison & Daniel Powers. 2009. 'Religious Influences on the Risk of Marital Dissolution.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:4 917-934.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	14	This study examined multiple dimensions of religious involvement and the risk of divorce among a nationwide sample of 2,979 first-time married couples. Multivariate proportional hazards modeling was used to analyze two waves of the National Survey of Families and Households. Results indicated that although each partner's religious attendance bore a modest relationship to marital dissolution, the risk of divorce was lower if husbands had conservative theological beliefs and when both partners belonged to mainline Protestant denominations. Conversely, the risk of divorce was elevated if husbands attended services more frequently than their wives and if wives were more theologically conservative than their husbands. These patterns withstood controls for sociodemographic covariates, marital duration, and marital quality. Directions for future research are discussed.	3	Margaret L. Vaaler; Christopher G.

Ryan, Suzanne, Kerry Franzetta, Erin Schelar & Jennifer Manlove. 2009. 'Family Structure History: Links to Relationship Formation Behaviors in Young Adulthood.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:4 935-953.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	8	Using data from three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 4,667), we examined the intergenerational link between parental family structure history and relationship formation in young adulthood. We investigated (a) whether parental family structure history is associated with young adults' own relationship formation behaviors, (b) which dimensions of family structure history are most predictive of children's later relationship formation behaviors, and (c) if the association between family structure history and young adulthood relationship formation differs by gender. Our findings provide evidence of an intergenerational link between parent relationship histories and their offspring's own relationship formation behaviors in young adulthood over and above confounding factors.	4	Suzanne Ryan; Kerry Franzetta; Erin Schelar; Jennifer Manlove

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	10	This study examines how the entrance of a stepfather influences adolescent ties to mothers and nonresident fathers and how prior ties to each biological parent influence the development of stepfather-stepchild ties. Data come from 1,753 adolescents in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health who lived with a single mother in Wave 1 who remained single, cohabited, or married by Wave 2, approximately 1 year later. Stepfamily formation had little consequence for adolescent-nonresident father ties. Adolescent-mother closeness, however, declined when cohabiting, but not married, stepfathers entered the household. Close ties to married stepfathers were more likely to develop when adolescents were closer to their mothers before stepfather entry. Prior ties to nonresident fathers were unrelated to stepfather-stepchild ties.	1	Valarie King

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	13	This study draws on social control and social learning theories to examine the role of dating-specific attitudes and practices as predictors of adolescents' sexual initiation. We include attention to the adolescent's reaction to control attempts as a further means of assessing family dynamics (i.e., frequency of dating disagreements). The study uses longitudinal data from 697 adolescents who were not sexually active at the first interview as well as separate interviews with parents. In models that include all parenting variables, parental caring, parents' preferences that the child should delay sex, and the frequency of dating disagreements were significant predictors of initiation of teen sexual activity.	4	Monica A.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	9	Prior research found that lower sexual frequency and satisfaction were associated with higher rates of divorce, but little research had examined the role of sexual activity in the dissolution of cohabiting unions. We drew upon social exchange theory to hypothesize why sexual frequency is more important in cohabitation: (a) cohabitors' lower costs of finding sexual alternatives, (b) cohabitors' lower barriers to ending the relationship in the form of union-specific economic and noneconomic capital, and (c) cohabitors' higher expectations for sexual activity. Using the National Survey of Families and Households (N = 5,902), we examined the relationship between sexual frequency and union dissolution. Results indicated that low sexual frequency was associated with significantly higher rates of union dissolution among cohabitors than married couples.	2	Scott T. Yabiku; Constance T. Gager
Bronte-Tinkew, Jacinta, Mindy Scott & Allison Horowitz. 2009. 'Male Pregnancy Intendedness and Children's Mental Proficiency and Attachment Security During Toddlerhood.'

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	1	Using a sample of biological resident fathers and their children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Birth Cohort (ECLS-B) 9- and 24-month surveys (N = 5,300), this study examines associations and the direct and indirect pathways through which men's pregnancy intentions influence toddlers' mental proficiency and attachment security. Findings indicate that unwanted and mistimed pregnancies for fathers had negative consequences for toddlers' mental proficiency and attachment security. Additionally, men's pregnancy intentions were found to work indirectly through lower prenatal behaviors and father engagement and greater mother-father relationship conflict to negatively influence toddlers' mental proficiency. Men's pregnancy intentions also worked indirectly through greater relationship conflict and higher father involvement to influence attachment security.	3	Jacinta Bronte-Tinkew; Mindy E.

Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:4 1026-1038.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	8	Data were collected from 708 adult children nested within 274 later-life families from the Within-Family Differences Study to explore the role of perceived maternal favoritism in the quality of sibling relations in midlife. Mixed-model analyses revealed that regardless of which sibling was favored, perceptions of current favoritism and recollections of favoritism in childhood reduced closeness among siblings. Recollections of maternal favoritism in childhood were more important than perceptions of current favoritism in predicting tension among adult siblings, regardless of age. Taken together, the findings from this investigation are consistent with childhood studies showing that siblings have better relationships when they believe that they are treated equitably by their parents.	6	J.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	11	This study uses data from married women in 30 nations to examine justice processes involving perceptions of fairness of the division of household labor and satisfaction with family life. Relative deprivation theory suggests that national context-operationalized here as nation-level gender equity-might serve as a comparative referent used by married women when making determinations of the fairness of the division of household labor. Multilevel analyses confirm that the effect of inequalities in the division of household labor on perceptions of fairness is moderated by national context, as is the effect of perceptions of fairness on satisfaction with family life. The effects are strongest in nations with high levels of gender equity, confirming two hypotheses suggested by relative deprivation theory.	1	Theodore N. Greenstein

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	9	The Social Relations Model (SRM) allows for examination of family relations on three different levels: the individual level (actor and partner effects), the dyadic level (relationship effects), and the family level (family effect). The aim of this study was to present a systematic review of SRM family studies and identify general patterns in the results. Results of reanalyses of 17 data sets showed that characteristics of the person who reports on the relationship and the unique characteristics of the relationship were most important explanations of differences in family relationships. The present systematic review contributes to a better understanding of who is driving relationship outcomes in families and provides suggestions concerning the application of the SRM to family data.	4	Veroni I.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	19	This article examines how migrant parents' gender affects transnational families' economic well-being. Drawing on 130 in-depth interviews with Salvadoran immigrants in the United States and adolescent and young adult children of migrants in El Salvador, I demonstrate that the gender of migrant parents centrally affects how well their families are faring. Gender structurally differentiates immigrant parents' experiences through labor market opportunities in the United States. Simultaneously, gendered social expectations inform immigrants' approaches to parental responsibilities and remitting behaviors. Remittances-the monies parents send-directly shape children's economic well-being in El Salvador. I find that even though immigrant mothers are structurally more disadvantaged than immigrant fathers, mother-away families are often thriving economically because of mothers' extreme sacrifices.	1	Leisy Abrego

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	5	Cross-sectional and repeated surveys from household components of Demographic and Health Surveys in sub-Saharan Africa were examined to determine whether household composition indicators for older adults (N = 52, 573), involving offspring and grandchildren, correlated with national levels of AIDS mortality. One in 4 was living with a grandchild whose own parents were absent. Absence was a result of residence elsewhere and parents being deceased. Older adults in countries with a high accumulation of AIDS mortality were more likely to live in a skip-generation household and with a double-orphaned grandchild and less likely to live in a 3-generation household. Change in living arrangements toward skip generation and a double orphaned household was experienced in countries with high accumulation of AIDS mortality.	1	Zachary Zimmer
Sherman, Jennifer. 2009. 'Bend to Avoid Breaking: Job Loss, Gender Norms, and Family Stability in Rural America.' Social Problems. 56:4 599-620.	Social Problems	2009	3	Using ethnographic and interview data, this article explores how labor market transformations affect gender norms and family life in a rural community that has historically been tied to a single industry. It argues that the gender strategies pursued by couples heavily impact their relationships and families. Flexibility with regard to gender norms is key to creating stable relationships in a context of labor market change that threatens the existing gender order. For couples that are tied rigidly to traditional breadwinner/homemaker gender roles, men's inabilities to be the sole providers create marital and family tensions. On the other hand, couples in which men are able to refocus their conceptions of masculinity on more attainable goals such as active parenting experience less strife and more satisfaction. The research finds that rural men are more flexible with regard to masculine identity than found by previous scholars, particularly with regard to conceptions of fatherhood. The article explores in depth the processes and discourses that facilitate flexible gender identities in this conservative rural community.	1	Jennifer Sherman

'the Economy, Military, and Ecologically Unequal Exchange Relationships in Comparative Perspective: a Panel Study of the Ecological Footprints of Nations, 1975-2000.' Social Problems. 56:4 621-646.	Social Problems	2009	32	The authors employ multiple theories within a political economy framework to examine the structural predictors of the per capita ecological footprints of nations. Engaged theories include ecological modernization, treadmill of production, treadmill of destruction, and ecologically unequal exchange. Results of cross-national panel regression models indicate that the treadmill of production in the context of economic development increases per capita footprints, which contradicts general claims of ecological modernization theory. Similarly, the treadmill of destruction in the mode of military expenditures per soldier positively affects per capita footprints. Those with relatively higher levels of exports sent to economically developed and militarily powerful nations experience suppressed consumption levels, and these effects are especially pronounced and increasingly so for less-developed countries, many of which consume resources well below globally sustainable thresholds. The latter sets of findings support key elements of ecologically unequal exchange theory. Ultimately, this research suggests that a political economy framework that considers domestic attributes and structural relationships in particular contexts is quite useful for understanding the consumption-based environmental harms of nations.	2	Andrew K.

Beamish, Thomas & Amy Luebbers. 2009. 'Alliance Building Across Social Movements: Bridging Difference in a Peace and Justice Coalition.' Social Problems. 56:4 647-676.	Social Problems	2009	7	Alliance building across social movement groups is an important aspect of social movement dynamics, contributing to their viability and capacity to promote social change. Yet, with few exceptions, cross-movement coalitions have received little sustained theoretical or empirical attention. This article contributes to an understanding of cross-movement coalition building through the examination of a successful case of alliance: a coalition of environmental justice and peace and anti-weapons proliferation groups to stop a federally funded U. S. biodefense laboratory from being built and operated in Roxbury, Massachusetts. Cross-movement collaboration was challenged by tensions arising from differences in positionality. Positional differences reflect status distinctions such as race, class, gender, and place and the differential experiences and expectations that result. Nonetheless, this coalition was able to resolve positional tensions and, as a result, remained a viable protest vehicle. We found this was accomplished through a cross-movement bridging process that involved (1) cause affirmation, (2) strategic deployment, (3) exclusion, and (4) co-development of cross-movement commitments. We extend existent accounts of cross-movement coalition by providing both a culturally founded and fine-grained account of coalition work in the maintenance of alliance relations. The article and its conclusions also address the broader implications of understanding successful trans-positional cross-movement alliances.	2	Thomas D. Beamish; Amy J. Luebbers
Krysan, Maria & Michael Bader. 2009. 'Racial Blind Spots: Black-white-latino Differences in Community Knowledge.' Social Problems. 56:4 677-701.	Social Problems	2009	2	This article explores racial/ethnic differences in community knowledge as a contributing mechanism through which residential segregation in U. S. cities is perpetuated. If whites, blacks, and Latinos are familiar with different communities, and that familiarity is influenced by community racial/ethnic composition, then these ``blind spots'' may constitute one barrier to integrative mobility. We address three questions: (1) Do blacks, whites, and Latinos have different community blind spots?; (2) Do blacks, whites, and Latinos of the same social, economic, and geographic backgrounds still have different blind spots?; and (3) Do the racial/ethnic characteristics of the community predict a racial/ethnic difference in blind spots, net of the respondent's and the community's other characteristics? Employing logistic regression and hierarchical linear models with data from the 2004-2005 Chicago Area Study, we explore how whites, blacks, and Latinos differ in their knowledge of actual communities in the Chicago metropolitan area and whether differences persist after controlling for social class characteristics. Results show strong evidence that community knowledge is shaped by race-both of the resident and of the target community. Policy implications of the results are discussed.	2	Maria Krysan; Michael D.

Cadge, Wendy, Elaine Ecklund & Nicholas Short. 2009. 'Religion and Spirituality: a Barrier and a Bridge in the Everyday Professional Work of Pediatric Physicians.' Social Problems. 56:4 702-721.	Social Problems	2009	6	We investigate how 30 pediatricians and pediatric oncologists who practice and teach at elite medical centers determine whether religion and spirituality are relevant to what Andrew Abbot (1988) calls their professional ``jurisdictions.'' Through in-depth interviews we focus on their everyday interactions with patients and families. We ask: (1) How do they gather information about religion and spirituality and determine when that information is relevant to their professional work? (2) Do they perceive religion and spirituality to be a barrier or a bridge to medical care as they do what Thomas Gieryn (1983) calls ``boundary work''? We find that pediatric oncologists more than pediatricians see religion and spirituality as relevant to their professional work, though still largely outside their professional jurisdiction. It is most relevant when families are making medical decisions and in end of life situations. Physicians tend to view religion and spirituality functionally, describing impermeable boundaries in medical decision making situations and more permeable boundaries at the end of life. Physicians view religion and spirituality as a barrier when it impedes medical recommendations and as a bridge when it helps families answer questions medicine inherently cannot. Such findings have implications for a wide range of professionals as they negotiate their jurisdictions, particularly around religion and spirituality, in everyday practice.	3	Wendy Cadge; Elaine Howard Ecklund; Nicholas Short
Bernstein, Mary & Marcie Cruz. 2009. '``what Are You?'': Explaining Identity as a Goal of the Multiracial Hapa Movement.' Social Problems. 56:4 722-745.	Social Problems	2009	2	This article uses the Hapa movement as a case study in order to provide a framework for understanding identity as a goal of social movements and to expand on a theoretical understanding of multiracial social movements. In contrast to current understandings of identity-based movements, this article argues that the Hapa movement seeks simultaneously to deconstruct traditional notions of (mono) racial identities and to secure recognition for a multiracial ``Hapa'' identity. Movements that have identity as a goal are motivated by activists' understandings of how categories are constituted and how those categories, codes, and ways of thinking serve as axes of regulation and domination. The Hapa movement simultaneously challenges (mono) racial categories at both the institutional level through targeting the state and at the micro level through challenging the quotidian enactment of race and promulgating a Hapa identity. Activism by mixed-race individuals and organizations constitutes an important challenge to power that has significant implications for racial categorization and classification in contemporary American society.	2	Mary Bernstein; Marcie Cruz
Heflin, Colleen, John Sandberg & Patrick Rafail. 2009. 'the Structure of Material Hardship in Us Households: an Examination of the Coherence Behind Common Measures of Well-being.' Social Problems. 56:4 746-764.	Social Problems	2009	9	Motivated by the growing interest in and the usage of measures of material hardship, together with the lack of a comprehensive theoretical understanding of the how indicators of material hardship relate to one another, we develop and test five conceptual models of the structural coherence of material hardship. While many previous analyses have relied on a unidimensional model of hardship, we argue that this is not conceptually and empirically sufficient. Instead, we compare the standard unidimensional account of hardship to a model that contrasts hardship related to physical necessities and hardship in less critical areas, two models contrasting hardships due to short-term constraints and those with longer time horizons, and finally, a model that posits each nominal type of hardship is best represented by its own latent construct. Using nationally representative data from the 2001 and 2004 panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) (U. S. Census Bureau 2001, 2004), we estimate confirmatory factor analyses, which suggest that a model of hardship that separates different dimensions-health, food, bill paying, and housing hardship-fits this data better than any of the other conceptual models tested. This finding suggests strongly that the four aspects of material hardship modeled here, though obviously associated, are best understood as arising from processes and structures that are not identical. We discuss implications of our findings for both the research community and policy makers in the conclusion.	3	Colleen Heflin; John Sandberg; Patrick Rafail

'Digital Inequality and Place: the Effects of Technological Diffusion on Internet Proficiency and Usage Across Rural, Suburban, and Urban Counties.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:4 391-417.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	14	Recently researchers have made efforts to reconceptualize digital inequality into discrete levels. These levels reflect access to and diffusion of technologies, proficiency in Internet usage, and propensity to take advantage of the opportunities afforded by information and communication technologies for assistance in daily life. We assess the utility of this approach for studying digital inequality across rural, suburban, and urban counties. Based on data from a 2005 nationally representative random sample telephone survey of 2,185 adults, the results provide mixed support for using this approach to studying digital inequality. In particular, we find that rural residents use Internet technologies less for assistance in helping with economics and other daily activities when compared with individuals from suburban and urban areas; however, our results suggest that this relationship is the product of the slow diffusion of advanced technologies to rural areas. The implications of these findings for understanding this under-theorized form of inequality are discussed, and we make contributions to this literature through empirically addressing issues of digital capital.	3	Michael J.

Kay, Fiona & Jean Wallace. 2009. 'Mentors as Social Capital: Gender, Mentors, and Career Rewards in Law Practice.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:4 418-452.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	5	Previous studies have demonstrated that mentoring provides numerous career benefits to individuals and organizations. This article advances past work by examining the effects of individuals' primary and multiple developmental relationships in a longitudinal study of the careers of lawyers. We develop a social capital perspective on mentorship emphasizing reciprocity of exchange, resource mobilization, and normative expectations embedded within mentoring relationships. We empirically assess mentoring benefits across a diverse range of career rewards. The results provide evidence that male lawyers gain more from their mentor-derived social capital than female lawyers. Specifically, male lawyers with mentors of senior status benefit with elevated earnings, greater perceived fairness in their workplace, and greater work satisfaction. Women with multiple mentors, however, report enhanced work satisfaction. Implications for research on mentoring, social capital, and professional careers are discussed.	2	Fiona M. Kay; Jean E.

Sociological Inquiry	2009	6	The academic achievement of immigrant children has been a focus of social research for decades. Yet little attention has been paid to peer social capital and its importance as a school context factor for the academic success of immigrant youths. Using multilevel data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Waves 1 and 3), this article draws upon social capital theory and assimilation theory to examine the effects of peer social capital on the academic achievement and attainment of immigrant and native youths. The effects of three measures of peer social capital are studied, controlled for many important variables, for example, sociodemographic background variables, school characteristics, and family social capital. Results indicate that only the average GPA (grade point average) of peers had a consistent and significant effect on children's achievement and attainment, whereas the density and the homogeneity of the peer network did not. Furthermore, all three measures of peer social capital have stronger effects for immigrant youths than for native youths.	1	Igor Ryabov

Sociological Inquiry	2009	0	Although a macro-organizational perspective has become increasingly commonplace in social movement analyses, few studies examine the full spectrum of organizations in any single social movement industry (SMI). Utilizing a unique source of data on Japanese environmental movement organizations, we compare characteristics of groups focused primarily on environmental issues with those for whom environmental issues are part of a larger multi-issue focus. We then profile across distinct, and theoretically important, organizational domains to assess how local, prefectural and national groups compare on a variety of organizational attributes, including: size, membership type, tactics and activities, and issues. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for understanding both Japanese environmentalism and the structure of SMIs generally.	3	Erik W. Johnson; Yoshitaka Saito; Makoto Nishikido

Catton, William. 2009. 'Understanding Humanity's Damaged Future.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:4 509-522.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	2	The notion that social facts can be caused only by other social facts is obsolete. Human societies today are affected by biogeochemical change. ``Developed'' human societies so overuse the finite planet they share with ``underdeveloped'' societies that the future of all is threatened. Medicine's prosthesis concept becomes useful for sociology when extended beyond referring to devices for replacing lost body parts or restoring impaired sensory powers. If we regard all modern tools and machines as prosthetic devices, we see them enabling humans to act as giants-giving us colossal resource appetites and huge environmental impacts. Prosthetic apparatus (and familiar assumptions) previously useful are subject to obsolescence. But there is cultural lag. Conceptual habits restrict the way we see our world. The bubble of twentieth century experience obstructs our understanding of the future into which we giants are plummeting. To explain severe hardships ahead in the twenty-first century, sociologists need to break out of our discipline's traditional conceptual bubble. Twentieth century expectations have become misleading. The basis of past progress (a carrying capacity surplus) is gone, replaced by a carrying capacity deficit. Earth's diminished carrying capacity will sustain fewer (dinosaur-equivalent) Homo colossus than original Homo sapiens.	1	William R. Catton
Hollister, Matissa. 2009. 'Is Optimal Matching Suboptimal?.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 38:2 235-264.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	8	Optimal matching (OM) is a method for measuring the similarity between pairs of sequences (e.g., work histories). This article discusses two problems with optimal matching. First, the author identifies a flaw in OM ``indel costs'' and proposes a solution to this flaw. Second, the author discusses the need for benchmarks to measure the added value of OM and to test competing versions. To that end, the author conducts an empirical test of traditional OM, the alternative localized OM, and sequence comparison. The test documents the problem with traditional OM and shows that it is solved by localized OM. The test also demonstrates the value of OM and sequence comparison in examining occupational sequences; both methods capture variation beyond traditional human capital and status attainment measures, although the marginal improvements of OM over sequence comparison may not justify its computational complexity. These results point to the need for more systematic approaches to sequence analysis methods.	1	Matissa Hollister

Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	0	Goodman and Kruskal's gamma coefficient measuring monotone association and its partial variants are useful for the analysis of multiway contingency tables containing ordinal variables. When the categories of a variable are only partly ordered and the variable is treated as a nominal variable, information in the ordering of the categories and statistical power is lost. The authors suggest a (P)gamma measure that is the maximum of the ordinary gamma coefficients obtained by permuting the categories of nominal or partially ordered variables, while leaving the partial ordering intact. When the assumption of a monotone underlying association is justified, this measure has higher power than nominal tests for association. Furthermore, the resulting optimal monotone ordering gives insight into the nature of this association, which is not obtained by tests for nominal variables. The properties of the (P)gamma coefficient are investigated in a simulation study and its use illustrated in two data sets.	2	Volkert Siersma; Svend Kreiner

Sociological Methods \& Research. 38:2 287-305.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	2	The scale-up estimator is a network-based estimator for the size of hidden or hard to count subpopulations. Several issues arise in the public health context when the aim is the estimation of injuries occurring in a certain population, where two common problems are present: (a) Small injuries are usually difficult to observe and rarely reported in the official data and (b) people are not always compliant in giving information about some specific injuries, in particular when children are involved. This study checked the methodological issues arising from using a computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI) survey using the scale-up methodology for detecting the number of injuries due to choking in children ages 0 to 14 in Italy. For this purpose, 1,000 CATI interviews were conducted during a week using a questionnaire based on 33 questions about populations of known size according to census data. Then, each respondent was asked about other questions related to the main target population (e.g., number of children known to suffer from a choking accident). A sensitivity analysis was conducted for estimating the effect of varying subpopulations, order of the questions, and interviewer effects on the resulting estimates. For the interviewer effect, no particular differences were observed in the overall estimates of injuries. The conclusion is the scale-up estimator in association with CATI methodology shows a high potential in the field of injury prevention, being accurate and robust, but particular attention should be given to the training of the interviewers to improve stability of the estimates.	5	Silvia Snidero; Federica Zobec; Paola Berchialla; Roberto Corradetti; Dario Gregori
Fullerton, Andrew. 2009. 'a Conceptual Framework for Ordered Logistic Regression Models.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 38:2 306-347.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	14	Ordinal-level measures are very common in social science research. Researchers often analyze ordinal dependent variables using the proportional odds logistic regression model. However, this ``traditional'' method is one of many different types of logistic regression models available for the analysis of ordered response variables. In this article, the author identifies 12 distinct models that rely on logistic regression and fit within a framework of three major approaches with variations within each approach based on the application of the proportional odds assumption. This typology provides a degree of conceptual clarity that is missing in the extant literature on logistic regression models for ordinal outcomes. The author illustrates the similarities and differences among the different models with examples from the General Social Survey and the American National Election Study.	1	Andrew S. Fullerton

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	4	Sub-divisions of labour in health settings are common and medical dominance and encroachment from competitors are well known. This article considers this general picture but in specific relation to mental health work in Britain and its particular features of recent contestation. British psychiatric orthodoxy has faced challenges to its legitimacy for over a century. However, since the 1980s, in the wake of de-institutionalisation and a new shared service commitment to `recovery', these challenges have taken new shape. They are explored by considering: the current ambit of mental health care; the sub-division of labour in specialist mental services; recent governmental expectations of the mental health workforce; and the contested legacy of theory and practice in mental health work. The conclusion is that the profession is not under immediate threat of collapse but that its fate may now rest on whether a biomedical or a biopsychosocial model of practice predominates in routine service delivery.	2	David Pilgrim; Anne Rogers

Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:7 962-978.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	14	Despite a well-documented gender pattern in adolescent mental health, research investigating possible explanatory factors from a gender-theoretical approach is scarce. This paper reports a grounded theory study based on 29 focus groups. The aim was to explore 16- to 19-year-old students' perceptions of what is significant for mental health, and to apply a gender analysis to the findings in order to advance understanding of the gender pattern in adolescent mental health. Significant factors were identified in three social processes categories, including both positive and negative aspects: (1) social interactions, (2) performance and (3) responsibility. Girls more often experienced negative aspects of these processes, placing them at greater risk for mental health problems. Boys' more positive mental health appeared to be associated with their low degree of responsibility-taking and beneficial positions relative to girls. Negotiating cultural norms of femininity and masculinity seemed to be more strenuous for girls, which could place them at a disadvantage with regard to mental health. Social factors and processes (particularly responsibility), gendered power relations and constructions of masculinities and femininities should be acknowledged as important for adolescent mental health.	3	Evelina Landstedt; Kenneth Asplund; Katja Gillander Gadin
Huyard, Caroline. 2009. 'Who Rules Rare Disease Associations? a Framework to Understand Their Action.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:7 979-993.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	1	The inner structure of so-called `patients' organisations' has been accorded relatively little attention with respect to their increasing role in the medical world. This comparative study in France of eight such organisations, matching six rare disorders, explores the issue of power and decision making through the description of the entities that make up the organisation (and especially which stakeholders are represented), their mutual relationships, the temporal scope of collective action, and the concrete achievements of the organisation. Two main types of organisation are distinguished: `pluralistic' organisations (that bring together a broad array of different stakeholders who are willing to work together) and `monistic' organisations (where a single category of stakeholders firmly takes the lead). Their operations are very different and result from the association's composition. A key finding is that both the usual opposition between lay and expert and the reference to the diseases' characteristics prove to be irrelevant to understanding these organisations. Rather, the composition of the leading group is crucial.	1	Caroline Huyard
Dew, Kevin & Trina Taupo. 2009. 'the Moral Regulation of the Workplace: Presenteeism and Public Health.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:7 994-1010.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	3	This paper draws on Durkheimian concepts of moral forces, particularly anomie and fatalism, and the forced division of labour, to argue that the current institutional arrangements to protect and compensate workers in hazardous workplaces are insufficient. This argument is illustrated with interview data from workers at a meatworks in New Zealand which examined workers' responses to illness and injury in the workplace. It is suggested that an imbalance in moral forces leads to pathological outcomes for workers - seen in presenteeism - the phenomenon of staying at work when injured or ill - and workplace injustice. There are state institutions such as worker compensation schemes and occupational safely and health regulations, and other intermediary groups such as unions, that can act as a buffer against anomic and fatalistic forces in the workplace, but at present these countervailing regulatory and advocacy forces are not sufficiently protective of vulnerable workers. Public health advocacy and research could fill the current void.	2	Kevin Dew; Trina Taupo
Farrugia, David. 2009. 'Exploring Stigma: Medical Knowledge and the Stigmatisation of Parents of Children Diagnosed With Autism Spectrum Disorder.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:7 1011-1027.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	12	This paper analyses 12 parent interviews to investigate the stigmatisation of parents of children diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. Drawing on poststructural accounts of the relationship between knowledge and subjectivity, the stigma concept is critically interrogated in order to address previous individualistic constructions of stigmatisation and to place stigma within the power dynamics of social control. The results of the study indicate that a child's diagnosis with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is critical for parents to resist stigmatisation. Parents experienced considerable enacted stigma, but successfully resisted felt stigma by deploying medical knowledge to articulate unspoiled subject positions. The institutionalisation of medical knowledge within the autism community was critical to this process. Resistance to enacted stigma was successful to the degree that medical constructions of deviance deployed by parents were accepted by others, notably those in power within institutions. It is concluded that poststructural accounts of subjectivity and social control provide a useful way of conceptualising stigmatisation. An acceptance of the painful nature of stigma as lived experience co-exists with an emphasis on the constantly negotiated nature of embodied subjectivity as a contingent social process to illustrate the conditions for active resistance to stigmatisation.	1	David Farrugia
Harris, Magdalena. 2009. 'Troubling Biographical Disruption: Narratives of Unconcern About Hepatitis C Diagnosis.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:7 1028-1042.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	9	This paper explores the impact of hepatitis C diagnosis among participants of a recent qualitative study based in New Zealand and Australia. The findings of this research were unique with regard to the small amount of existing literature on the topic. Whilst most social research indicates that diagnosis with hepatitis C is a disruptive or distressing experience, study participants were almost evenly divided between those who reported being distressed by diagnosis and those who described contracting hepatitis C as `no big deal'. The varied nature of participants' narratives about their hepatitis C diagnosis indicates that the experience of biographical disruption is contextual: dependent upon previous experiences of illness, marginalisation or hardship, and the extent to which hepatitis C is an unknown entity or normalised within community networks. This paper draws on the theoretical frameworks of biographical disruption, normalisation and dys-appearance to illuminate these and other contextual issues informing participants' narratives of unconcern about hepatitis C diagnosis.	1	Magdalena Harris
Locock, Louise, Sue Ziebland & Carol Dumelow. 2009. 'Biographical Disruption, Abruption and Repair in the Context of Motor Neurone Disease.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:7 1043-1058.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	11	Concepts of biographical disruption and repair have been widely applied to chronic illness, but not terminal illness. This paper examines the relevance of these concepts to motor neurone disease (MND), a progressive neurological condition characterised by loss of mobility, speech and ability to breathe or swallow. Survival is usually between two and five years, and some die within a few months. The condition thus lies at the boundary between chronic and terminal illness. Narrative interviews were conducted with 35 people living with MND and 11 family carers; analysis explored how people constructed their accounts as well as what they said. As well as accounts of biographical disruption, we identified a distinctive sense that the diagnosis is a `death sentence' and life is already over, which we term `biographical abruption'. We also found instances of biographical repair, as participants sought to make sense of their remaining life, restore normality and control, and find new meaning and identity.	3	Louise Locock; Sue Ziebland; Carol Dumelow
Sulik, Gayle. 2009. 'Managing Biomedical Uncertainty: the Technoscientific Illness Identity.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:7 1059-1076.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	4	This paper analyses how the biomedical uncertainty of breast cancer contributes to the development of a new type of illness identity that is grounded in biomedical knowledge, advanced technology, and biomedical health and risk surveillance. The technoscientific identity (TSI) develops through the application of sciences and technologies to one's sense of self. Analysing narrative data from 60 in-depth interviews with women diagnosed with breast cancer, this research demonstrates how women diagnosed with breast cancer develop and maintain TSIs through four processes: (1) immersion in professional biomedical knowledge, (2) locating themselves within a technoscientific framework, (3) receiving support for the emerging TSI from the medical system and support networks, and (4) eventually prioritising their biomedical classifications over their suffering. Developing a TSI enables people to make sense of biomedical information, make decisions, and manage medical processes and relationships in the face of biomedical and personal uncertainty even as it extends the reach of technoscience and biomedicalisation.	1	Gayle A.

Lutfey, Karen & John McKinlay. 2009. 'What Happens Along the Diagnostic Pathway to Chd Treatment? Qualitative Results Concerning Cognitive Processes.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:7 1077-1092.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	5	Extensive research on health disparities documents persistent differential diagnosis and treatment of many conditions according to patient characteristics, physician attributes, and healthcare systems. Less is known about how physicians arrive at their decisions. We use qualitative data from a vignette-based factorial experiment to examine how physicians reason through and account for their clinical decisions, and how variations arise despite the presentation of identical symptoms of coronary heart disease (CHD). We find that physicians show evidence of cognitive biases but also actively interpret social characteristics they deem relevant to medical treatment. In an uncertain clinical context, these diagnostic pathways expose key junctures wherein physicians are detoured to alternative diagnoses, their certainty of CHD lowered, and scientific logic makes it difficult to return to a CHD diagnosis - thereby providing a fuller picture of why some cases are counted as CHD while others are not. These results have important implications insofar as diagnostic decisions like these contribute to the compilation of epidemiologic base rates, and are therefore used as part of Bayesian decision making to determine the probability of CHD in subsequent patients. This work resonates with social constructivist concerns regarding the ways disease categories are established and maintained, and potential sources of bias in official rates detected.	2	Karen E.

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	5	This article provides an historical review of international research related to sociology and oral health and healthcare. I begin by considering the relevance of the mouth and oral health to social interactions and physical health, and outline existing inequalities in oral health and healthcare experiences. The paper examines critically some of the existing published research in the field - considering both what might be described as sociology of oral health and healthcare and sociology in oral healthcare - and demonstrates the dearth of sociological research related to this subject compared to other areas of interest within the field of sociology of health and illness. I conclude by suggesting some ways in which this area could be expanded and developed further. I suggest that sociological analyses of how individuals experience, understand and manage their mouth and oral health, can add to and enhance the broader field of the sociology of health and illness. Further, examining experiences and provision of oral healthcare may provide sociology with a new opportunity to explore the neglected field of private healthcare, but also to engage with health policy makers who seek to address oral healthcare needs.	1	Catherine Exley
Berk, Gerald & Dennis Galvan. 2009. 'How People Experience and Change Institutions: a Field Guide to Creative Syncretism.' Theory and Society. 38:6 543-580.	Theory and Society	2009	7	This article joins the debate over institutional change with two propositions. First, all institutions are syncretic, that is, they are composed of an indeterminate number of features, which are decomposable and recombinable in unpredictable ways. Second, action within institutions is always potentially creative, that is, actors draw on a wide variety of cultural and institutional resources to create novel combinations. We call this approach to institutions creative syncretism. This article is in three parts. The first shows how existing accounts of institutional change, which are rooted in structuralism, produce excess complexity and render the most important sources and results of change invisible. We argue that in order to ground the theory of creative syncretism we need a more phenomenological approach, which explains how people live institutional rules. We find that grounding in John Dewey's pragmatist theory of habit. The second part of the article explains Dewey and shows how the theory of habit can ground an experiential account of institutional rules. The third part presents a field guide to creative syncretism. It uses an experiential approach to provide novel insights on three problems that have occupied institutionalist research: periodization in American political development, convergence among advanced capitalist democracies, and institutional change in developing countries.	2	Gerald Berk; Dennis Galvan
Ghaziani, Amin. 2009. 'an ``amorphous Mist''? the Problem of Measurement in the Study of Culture.' Theory and Society. 38:6 581-612.	Theory and Society	2009	3	Sociological studies of culture have made significant progress on conceptual clarification of the concept, while remaining comparatively quiescent on questions of measurement. This study empirically examines internal conflicts (or ``infighting''), a ubiquitous phenomenon in political organizing, to propose a ``resinous culture framework'' that holds promise for redirection. The data comprise 674 newspaper articles and more than 100 archival documents that compare internal dissent across two previously unstudied lesbian and gay Marches on Washington. Analyses reveal that activists use infighting as a vehicle to engage in otherwise abstract definitional debates that provide concrete answers to questions such as who are we and what do we want. The mechanism that enables infighting to concretize these cultural concerns is its coupling with fairly mundane and routine organizational tasks. This mechanism affords one way to release the culture concept, understood here as collective self-definitions, from being ``an amorphous, indescribable mist which swirls around society members,'' as it was once provocatively described.	1	Amin Ghaziani
Zarycki, Tomasz. 2009. 'the Power of the Intelligentsia: the Rywin Affair and the Challenge of Applying the Concept of Cultural Capital to Analyze Poland's Elites.' Theory and Society. 38:6 613-648.	Theory and Society	2009	2	This article aims at integrating the phenomenon of the Central and Eastern European intelligentsia into the application of the theory of cultural capital of Pierre Bourdieu to the analysis of societies of that region. This is done by critically reevaluating the model of evolution of the post-communist countries of Central Europe proposed by Gil Eyal, Ivan Szel,nyi, and Eleanor Townsley, in their ``Making Capitalism without Capitalists.'' The present article argues for supplementing their approach with an analytical distinction between the concepts of intellectuals (as masters of the critical discourse culture) and the intelligentsia, which in countries like Poland have an important component of post-gentry culture. The identity and images of the intelligentsia are analyzed as important though highly contested aspects of cultural capital in Poland. Wide implications of discursive battles on the status of intelligentsia in contemporary Poland are exemplified in the case of the debates over the so-called Rywin Affair in Poland and the role played in that affair by the major Polish intellectual Adam Michnik. The political discourse related to the affair and to the status of Michnik are studied in context of the structure of the Polish political scene and related to the academic debates on the intelligentsia, whether it is a ``really existing'' and significant social group or merely a marginal one and ``outdated discourse.''.	1	Tomasz Zarycki
Blair-Loy, Mary. 2009. 'Work Without End? Scheduling Flexibility and Work-to-family Conflict Among Stockbrokers.' Work and Occupations. 36:4 279-317.	Work and Occupations	2009	15	The common finding in the work-family literature that workplace scheduling flexibility reduces work-to-family conflict may not be generalizable to service occupations with intense client demands. This qualitative analysis of stockbrokers finds that brokers in firms granting scheduling flexibility experience more work-to-family conflict than those in the firm with scheduling rigidity. Although brokers in the latter firm lose autonomy from their employer (and earning potential), bureaucratic rigidity buffers them from client pressures that intrude on family life. This finding should be tested in other occupations requiring extensive client interactions in a 24-hour economy.	1	Mary Blair-Loy

Work and Occupations	2009	13	Trends toward gender equality largely stalled in the 1990s, but the progress of women in management was mixed. Given the importance of managers as actors in the reproduction of inequality, and managerial positions as rewards in their own right, this study investigates the relative status of women in management over the past two decades, using U.S. Decennial Census data from 1980 to 2000. The authors find that women's entry into management occupations slowed markedly in the 1990s. Furthermore, after decreasing in the 1980s, gender segregation among managers rebounded sharply upward in the 1990s. However, greater segregation coincided with a decreasing gender earnings gap, which largely resulted from narrowing gaps within integrated or male-dominated managerial occupations. Finally, there remains a substantial earnings penalty for managers who work in female-dominated occupations.	3	Philip N. Cohen; Matt L. Huffman; Stefanie Knauer

Work and Occupations	2009	4	This article argues that cross-national diversity in women's concentration in the public sector explains a substantial part of the cross-national variation in the gender gap in job authority. Using data on individuals in 26 countries represented in the 2005 International Social Survey Program module on Work Orientation (supplemented by societal-level information), this study supports this argument. The authors find that in countries with high levels of women's concentration in the public sector, the gender gap in job authority is wider than in countries with lower levels of public sector feminization. The implications of these results are discussed in the context of state interventions in gender inequalities.	2	Meir Yaish; Haya Stier
Kandel, William & Katharine Donato. 2009. 'Does Unauthorized Status Reduce Exposure to Pesticides? Evidence From the National Agricultural Workers Survey.' Work and Occupations. 36:4 367-399.	Work and Occupations	2009	0	Ample scholarship suggests that unauthorized immigrants are more likely to face occupational hazards because their lack of legal status makes them more vulnerable to workplace abuse. Despite much research documenting how legal status affects wages, employment, and job stability, few studies have empirically analyzed impacts of legal status on the employment conditions of hired farmworkers. In this article we examine whether unauthorized farmworkers are more likely to handle pesticides and receive pesticide training. We use the National Agricultural Workers Survey, a data set that distinguishes between unauthorized, authorized, and citizen workers. Results from descriptive statistics and multivariate analyses suggest, contrary to expectation, that unauthorized legal status is associated with a reduced likelihood of handling pesticides or receiving training for pesticides. This finding is bolstered by results for control variables associated with unauthorized status, such as age and U.S. agricultural employment experience. Taken together, the results are consistent with labor market segmentation theory that suggests jobs encompassing occupational hazards are allocated to or held by more experienced workers who are better compensated for the risks they undertake.	2	William A.

Kornrich, Sabino. 2009. 'Entrepreneurship as Economic Detour? Client Segregation by Race and Class and the Black-white Earnings Gap Among Physicians.' Work and Occupations. 36:4 400-431.	Work and Occupations	2009	2	Since the Civil Rights Movement, greater numbers of African Americans have moved into professional work but continue to have lower earnings than their White counterparts. One possible explanation for this difference is that Black professionals have lower earnings because they serve larger percentages of Blacks in their practices. However, little research has documented this hypothesized effect, particularly while controlling for specialization and other important earnings-relevant characteristics. Additionally, little research has focused on why this effect occurs: Black clients may be less able to pay for costly services, or organizations may devalue work done by professionals when they serve Black clients. This article uses data on the earnings of Black and White doctors to test whether and how the proportion of Black patients influences earnings. It is found that the proportion of Black patients is significantly associated with lower earnings for entrepreneurial Black doctors, higher earnings for entrepreneurial White doctors, and has no association with the earnings of either Black or White doctors who work in nonentrepreneurial settings. Supplementary analysis shows that controlling for doctors' reliance on Medicare and Medicaid revenues reduces the associations between patients' racial composition and earnings to zero for both Black and White physicians. These findings suggest that there is little bias in organizational pay-setting practices against positions that serve larger numbers of Black clients. Instead, disadvantage results from Black patients' greater reliance on lower paying Medicare and Medicaid insurances and client segregation on the basis of race and class among physicians.	1	Sabino Kornrich
Condron, Dennis. 2009. 'Social Class, School and Non-school Environments, and Black/white Inequalities in Children's Learning.' American Sociological Review. 74:5 683-708.	American Sociological Review	2009	16	As social and economic stratification between black and white Americans persists at the dawn of the twenty-first century, disparities in educational outcomes remain an especially formidable barrier Recent research on the black/white achievement gap points to a perplexing pattern in this regard. Schools appear to exacerbate black/white disparities in learning while simultaneously slowing the growth of social class gaps. How might this occur? Using 1st grade data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), I test-and find support for-the proposition that school factors play an elevated role in generating the black/white achievement gap while non-school factors primarily drive social class inequalities. These findings help explain why black/white achievement disparities grow mostly during the school year (when schools are in session and have their greatest impact on students' learning) while class gaps widen mostly during the summer (when school is out of session and non-school influences dominate). I conclude by discussing the implications for future research, especially as they pertain to what appears to be the most important contributor to the black/white achievement gap: school racial segregation.	1	Dennis J.

Crosnoe, Robert. 2009. 'Low-income Students and the Socioeconomic Composition of Public High Schools.' American Sociological Review. 74:5 709-730.	American Sociological Review	2009	29	Increasing constraints placed on race-based school diversification have shifted attention to socioeconomic desegregation. Although past research suggests that socioeconomic desegregation can produce heightened achievement, the ``frog pond'' perspective points to potential problems with socioeconomic desegregation in nonachievement domains. Such problems are important in their own right, and they may also chip away at the magnitude of potential achievement benefits. In this article, I report conducted propensity score analyses and robustness calculations on a sample of public high schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. As the proportion of the student body with middle- or high-income parents increased, low-income students progressed less far in math and science. Moreover, as the proportion of the student body with middle- or high-income or college-educated parents increased, low-income students experienced more psychosocial problems. Such patterns were often more pronounced among African American and Latina students. These findings suggest curricular and social psychological mechanisms of oft-noted frog pond effects in schools and extend the frog pond framework beyond achievement itself to demographic statuses (e.g., race/ethniciry and SES) perceptually linked to achievement. In terms of policy, these findings indicate that socioeconomic desegregation plans should also attend to equity in course enrollments and the social integration of students more generally.	1	Robert Crosnoe
Alon, Sigal. 2009. 'the Evolution of Class Inequality in Higher Education: Competition, Exclusion, and Adaptation.' American Sociological Review. 74:5 731-755.	American Sociological Review	2009	16	This study develops a comprehensive theoretical framework regarding the evolution of the class divide in postsecondary education. I conceptualize three prototypes of class inequality-effectively maintained, declining, and expanding-and associate their emergence with the level of competition in college admissions. I also unearth the twin mechanisms, exclusion and adaptation, that link class hierarchy to a highly stratified postsecondary system in an allegedly meritocratic environment. Intra- and inter-cohort comparisons reveal that while the class divide regarding enrollment and access to selective postsecondary schooling is ubiquitous, it declines when competition for slots in higher education is low and expands during periods of high competition. In such a regime of effectively expanding inequality (EEI), a greater emphasis on a certain selection criterion (like test scores) in admission decisions-required to sort the influx of applicants-is bolstered by class-based polarization vis-a-vis this particular criterion. This vicious cycle of exclusion and adaptation intensifies and expedites the escalation of class inequality. The results show that adaptation is more effective than exclusion in expanding class inequality in US. higher education.	1	Sigal Alon

American Sociological Review	2009	19	Drawing on original qualitative research, this article investigates how natives and institutions in rural America ``new immigrant destinations'' are adapting, if at all, to Hispanic newcomers and whether corresponding interaction should be viewed as substantively responsive. In contrast to predictions made by traditional political incorporation theories, results based on semi-structured interviews and ethnographic fieldwork suggest that Hispanic newcomers are undergoing a process of bureaucratic incorporation whereby public service bureaucrats, rather than elected politicians, are initiating substantive responsiveness. Yet I also identify a continuing interaction between immigrant bureaucratic and political incorporation in rural America. I conclude by connecting my findings to more general sociological perspectives regarding population needs, electoral bodies, and public bureaucracies in democratic societies.	1	Helen B. Marrow

American Sociological Review	2009	53	Decades of racial progress have led some researchers and policy makers to doubt that discrimination remains an important cause of economic inequality. To study contemporary discrimination, we conducted afield experiment in the low-wage labor market of New York City, recruiting white, black, and Latina job applicants who were matched on demographic characteristics and interpersonal skills. These applicants were given equivalent resumes and sent to apply in tandem for hundreds of entry-level jobs. Our results show that black applicants were half as likely as equally qualified whites to receive a callback or job offer In fact, black and Latina applicants with clean backgrounds fared no better than white applicants just released from prison. Additional qualitative evidence from our applicants `experiences further illustrates the multiple points at which employment trajectories can be deflected by various forms of racial bias. These results point to the subtle yet systematic forms of discrimination that continue to shape employment opportunities for low-wage workers.	3	Devah Pager; Bruce Western; Bart Bonikowski
Stainback, Kevin & Donald Tomaskovic-Devey. 2009. 'Intersections of Power and Privilege: Long-term Trends in Managerial Representation.' American Sociological Review. 74:5 800-820.	American Sociological Review	2009	18	This article examines post-Civil Rights Act trends in private sector managerial representation for white men, white women, black men, and black women. We examine how three factors affect changing access to managerial positions: (1) industrial restructuring, (2) the process of bottom-up ascription, and (3) organizational characteristics. Accounting for compositional shifts in the labor supply, we find that white male managerial overrepresentation remains virtually unchanged since 1966, even while other status groups make gains. A significant portion of the observed equal opportunity advance for women and blacks takes place in the expanding service sectors of the economy. We also find that female and minority gains are enhanced in larger and more managerially intensive workplaces. For all groups, managerial representation is increasingly tied to the presence of similar others in nonmanagerial jobs. Further examination reveals a new status hierarchy of managers and subordinates-a hierarchy wherein white men are likely to manage men of all races. White women, in comparison, are realizing a growing racial privilege in managing women of color.	2	Kevin Stainback; Donald Tomaskovic-Devey
Martin, Andrew, John McCarthy & Clark McPhail. 2009. 'Why Targets Matter: Toward a More Inclusive Model of Collective Violence.' American Sociological Review. 74:5 821-841.	American Sociological Review	2009	5	Efforts to develop a unified model of collective violence have been limited by the diverse array of events analyzed, from terrorist attacks to riots. This article seeks to develop a more inclusive theoretical and analytic framework by exploring the targets of violence, something that has received little disaggregated attention. We argue that consideration of who or what is targeted during the course of an event, together with collectivity size and the conditional role it may play, offers new theoretical insight into collective violence dynamics. Our analysis draws from newspaper records on a diverse range of collectivities, from parties to rallies to riots. We find that in many contexts, collectivity size increases the likelihood of violence against some targets, notably state actors, while reducing attacks on others. These findings provide the basis for a broader discussion of why unpacking targets is so critical to understanding the dynamics of collective violence.	3	Andrew W. Martin; John D.

Tope, Daniel & David Jacobs. 2009. 'the Politics of Union Decline: the Contingent Determinants of Union Recognition Elections and Victories.' American Sociological Review. 74:5 842-864.	American Sociological Review	2009	9	Despite the close political regulation of union recognition disputes, sociologists have paid little attention to recent political determinants of success in these contests. A state-centered political-opportunity approach suggests that if conservative political officials can reduce the number of union recognition elections, union organization will be blocked. Partly because man labor scholars claim there was a postwar departure in labor movement fortunes, we attempt to detect and model a contingent break in the relationship between Republican control of the presidency and these elections using interactive specifications. Our findings show that shortly after the conservative, anti-union Reagan administration took office, recognition elections, and union victories in these elections, fell sharply. With macroeconomic and other determinants held constant, other political conditions with explanatory power include congressional oversight committee ideology and conservative appointments to the key regulatory agency. Our findings support political accounts and also suggest that unions' failures to organize new workplaces were sustained by subsequent conservative administrations.	2	Daniel Tope; David Jacobs
Hamilton, Laura & Elizabeth Armstrong. 2009. 'Gendered Sexuality in Young Adulthood Double Binds and Flawed Options.' Gender \& Society. 23:5 589-616.	Gender \& Society	2009	34	Current work on hooking up-or casual sexual activity on college campuses-takes an individualistic, ``battle of the sexes'' approach and underestimates the importance of college as a classed location. The authors employ an interactional, intersectional approach using longitudinal ethnographic and interview data on a group of college women's sexual and romantic careers. They find that heterosexual college women contend with public gender beliefs about women's sexuality that reinforce male dominance across both hookups and committed relationships. The four-year university, however, also reflects a privileged path to adulthood. The authors show that it is characterized by a classed self-development imperative that discourages relationships but makes hooking up appealing. Experiences of this structural conflict vary. More privileged women struggle to meet gender and class guidelines for sexual behavior, placing them in double binds. Less privileged women find the class beliefs of the university foreign and hostile to their sexual and romantic logics.	2	Laura Hamilton; Elizabeth A. Armstrong

Gender \& Society	2009	9	Studies of heteronormativity have emphasized its normative content and repressive functions, but few have considered the strategic use of heteronormative and homonormative precepts to shape sexual selves, public identities, and social relations. Adopting an interactionist approach, this article analyzes interviews with homosexual elders to uncover their use of heteronormative premises ( specifically, the presumption of heterosexuality, and the gender binary) to pass as heterosexual. Informants also used homonormative precepts, grounded in a postwar, pre-gay liberation assimilationist homosexual politics they adopted in their early years and maintained in later life, to justify passing and to frame their understanding and evaluation of past and present homosexual practices. Viewed through a homonormative lens, heteronormativity provided the tools for personal survival in a hostile society and for the collective production of a respectable homosexual culture. Informants' strategic use of heteronormativity can help explain heteronormativity's survival despite the incoherence and fragility of its content.	1	Dana Rosenfeld

Gender \& Society	2009	0	Claims to sisterhood are premised on women's experiences with gender oppression, and many have argued that such claims ignore differences among women. Many have therefore dismissed sisterhood as a legitimate claim to solidarity, failing to examine the ways that sisterhood continues to be utilized by feminist activists. This article examines qualitative data from a study of a white, middle-class, feminist, antiracist organization that uses the language of sisterhood in its work on behalf of incarcerated women, who are predominantly of color and poor. The author finds not only that sisterhood is simultaneously rooted in women's experiences with oppression and pride and pleasure but that such language serves complex functions in feminist organizations that seek to work across difference. Beyond its use in creating and sustaining solidarity, sisterhood is utilized to bridge differences in race, class, and life experiences between women and to generate feelings of legitimacy amongst white, middle-class activists.	1	Jodie Michelle Lawston

Gender \& Society	2009	1	Masculinities vary by organizational context, demonstrating that organizational culture shapes the gendering of work even within the same occupation. The author draws on comparative and ethnographic data collected in two retail environments ( large and small musical instrument stores) to understand how a common organizational culture is differently gendered by the organization of work. In these music stores, organizational culture is driven by masculinist fantasies of the rock musician lifestyle. As the products and knowledge of the rock musician lifestyle are made popularly accessible and retail work is de-skilled, a style of masculinity based on fraternization and competition takes the place of formal knowledge and experience-reaffirming rock musician as a populist, but exclusively male identity. The article concludes with a consideration of how the de-skilling of retail work reproduces gendered interactions that affirm men's control over work and its products, even as retail work is presumed to be feminizing.	1	Carey Sargent

Gender \& Society	2009	7	The cultural construction of motherhood represents women of low socioeconomic status (SES) as excessively fertile, placing them outside of the infertility discourse. Previous research on infertility reinforces poor women's exclusion by focusing on the experiences of women receiving medical treatment, typically women of high SES. In this article, the author explores how 20 poor and working-class women negotiate their experiences of infertility. In-depth interviews expose the contextual experiences of infertility among women of low SES, specifically revealing the structural inequality apparent within those experiences. The women are not passive objects of dominant discourses; they are active subjects in resisting, redefining, and accepting the discourses according to their contexts. Women of low SES are outsiders-within to dominant understandings and resolutions to infertility. Their unique insights not only provide a more nuanced understanding of infertility but they also begin to deconstruct the stratified system of reproduction.	1	Ann V. Bell
Glass, Pepper. 2009. 'Unmaking a Movement: Identity Work and the Outcomes of Zapatista Community Centers in Los Angeles.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 38:5 523-546.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	2	Identity work explains how participants in social movements build and maintain their collective identities, uniting movement groups. This study, based on ethnographic fieldwork comparing two Zapatista community centers in Los Angeles, asks if the absence of identity work leads to the dissolution of organizations. Both of these groups neglected work of identity convergence and identity construction to integrate three subgroups-''activists,'' ``organizers,'' and ``community members''-into a whole. Yet a lack of identity work alone does not explain the relative stability of one group while the second experienced conflict and eventually disbanded. Additional structural influences-an external crisis facing the group and the internal proportions between members-combined with these cultural factors to bring about organizational schism.	1	Pepper G.

Garrett-Peters, Raymond. 2009. '``if I Don't Have to Work Anymore, Who Am I?'': Job Loss and Collaborative Self-concept Repair.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 38:5 547-583.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	6	Previous research on unemployment among managers and professionals has documented the experience of job loss as stressful because of both economic strain and the damage it does to valued identities and self-conceptions. Little research, however, has examined the processes through which displaced workers collectively attempt to repair this damage. Data from participant observation in four support groups, plus intensive interviews with twenty-two group members, are used to develop an analysis of the self-concept repair strategies used by these relatively privileged workers. Five main strategies are identified: (1) redefining the meaning of unemployment, (2) realizing accomplishment, (3) restructuring time, (4) forming accountability partnerships, and (5) helping others. These findings suggest that our understandings of how people cope with stressful life events need to take into account the social capital available to different groups. A second implication concerns our understanding of how the self-concept operates as a source of motivation.	1	Raymond Garrett-Peters
Hallett, Tim, Brent Harger & Donna Eder. 2009. 'Gossip at Work: Unsanctioned Evaluative Talk in Formal School Meetings.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 38:5 584-618.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	2	This article uses a form of linguistic ethnography (LE) to analyze videotaped recordings of gossip that took place during formal school meetings. By comparing these gossip data against existing models of gossip based on data collected in informal settings, the authors identify eleven new response classes, including four forms of indirectness that operate to cloak gossip under ambiguity and seven forms of avoidance that change the trajectory of gossip. In doing so, this article makes three larger contributions. First, it opens a new front in research on organizational politics by providing an empirically grounded, conceptually rich vocabulary for analyzing gossip in formal contexts. Second, it contributes to knowledge about social interactions in organizations. By examining gossip talk embedded within a work context, this project highlights the nexus among structure, agency, and interaction. Third, it contributes to understandings of gossip in general. By examining gossip in a context previously unexamined, this project provides analytical leverage for theorizing conditions under which gossip is likely and when it will take various forms.	3	Tim Hallett; Brent Harger; Donna Eder

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	5	The growth of the Internet and computer-mediated communications has enabled the formation of a variety of deviant subcultures online, particularly among sexual deviants. This qualitative study examines the subculture of the male heterosexual clients of sex workers by exploring their argot. Using a sample of posts from Web forums in ten U. S. cities, this study identifies three subcultural norms that structure beliefs and attitudes about sex work among johns: experience, commodification, and sexuality. The influence of computer-mediated communications on the formation of subcultures and argot are explored as well.	2	Kristie R. Blevins; Thomas J. Holt
Benson, Rodney. 2009. 'What Makes News More Multiperspectival? a Field Analysis.' Poetics. 37:5, SI 402-418.	Poetics	2009	8	Democratic normative theory suggests that the news media should promote a broad range of viewpoints, yet little research has attempted to identify and explain variations in press multiperspectivalness. This article introduces new generalizable measures of ideological and institutional pluralism, and applies them to a case study of immigration news coverage by a cross-section of the U.S. and French national newspaper fields. The most multiperspectival newspapers tend to receive less of their funding from advertising and have audiences with higher cultural capital. Consistent cross-national differences may be partially attributed to political field influence and news formats. In contrast to more atomized U.S. narrative-driven news stories, the French ``debate ensemble'' format (grouping together breaking news, editorials, interview transcripts, and background context articles) serves as the opening to it wide-ranging public debate. When U.S. newspapers offered ``multi-genre'' news coverage, their degree of multiperspectivalness also increased.	1	Rodney Benson

'Ethnic Boundaries in National Literary Histories: Classification of Ethnic Minority Fiction Authors in American, Dutch and German Anthologies and Literary History Books, 1978-2006.' Poetics. 37:5 419-438.	Poetics	2009	6	This article compares the classification of ethnic minority fiction writers in American, Dutch and German literary anthologies and literary history books for the period of 1978-2006. Using content analyses, ethnic boundaries are Much stronger in Dutch and German textbooks than in their American counterparts. While, across the entire period, Dutch and Gentian textbooks under-represent ethnic minority authors relative to the share of ethnic minorities in the population - and emphasize their ethnicity, American anthologies from 1991 to 2006 over-represent ethnic minorities and classify these authors primarily in literary terms. These findings are not only due to demographics alone but also related to differences in the field of textbook publishing (United States) and the extent to which national cultural repertoires vary from moderate ethnic inclusion (Netherlands) to strong ethnic exclusion (Germany).	1	Pauwke Berkers
Braden, Laura. 2009. 'From the Armory to Academia: Careers and Reputations of Early Modern Artists in the United States.' Poetics. 37:5 439-455.	Poetics	2009	5	This research considers the process of consecration by tracking all 308 artists who exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show to see which are included in prominent art history textbooks nearly a century later. In particular, I examine how artist attributes (e.g., gender) and a legitimating organization (the Museum of Modem Art) shape this process. Regression results indicate that, among other things, the number and type of exhibitions that Armory artists garnered at MoMA from 1929 to 1967 dramatically raise the odds that they are featured in 21st century textbooks. Meanwhile, many artist attributes (e.g., gender) have no hearing on the odds of textbook inclusion. However, several artist attributes - particularly gender - matter in that they significantly predict which artists ever-exhibited at MoMA in the mid-1900s. Such findings suggest that certain types of contemporary valorization (MoMA exhibition) matter for later consecration - especially when a legitimating organization functions as a gatekeeper that grants exposure to certain types of artists while excluding others.	1	Laura E.

Poetics	2009	3	This paper presents the outline of a symmetrical approach for investigating linkages between cultural classifications and various types of social divisions based on class, gender, age, etc. Central to this approach is the argument that cultural classifications and social divisions are co-constructed in ways that involve both discursive/symbolic and behavioural/material dimensions. After outlining this theoretical framework, we explore its usefulness firstly by examining discursive representations of cultural categories such as highbrows and omnivores and secondly by analysing patterns of cultural consumption in Quebec front 1979 to 2004. Exploring the links between discursive construction of cultural categories and social divisions, we identify various classification struggles waged around cultural eclecticism.	3	Michele Ollivier; Guy Gauthier; Alexis Hieu Truong
Bennett, Andy. 2009. '``heritage Rock'': Rock Music, Representation and Heritage Discourse.' Poetics. 37:5 474-489.	Poetics	2009	7	This article seeks to illustrate how ``rock'' music, as originally defined by an aesthetic dating back to the mid-1960s, is now being culturally and historically repositioned through the application of ``heritage rock'' discourses. Changing definitions of heritage in an era of cultural fragmentation give rise to new understandings and articulations of cultural heritage. It is in this context that the concept of heritage rock must be placed. Three examples of the heritage rock discourse and practice are considered: Classic Albums Live, the Canterbury Sound website, and Songworks (a small independent record label). Classic Albums Live constitutes an essentially conservative articulation of heritage rock grounded in dominant rock canons; the Canterbury Sound website and Songworks, represent a more DIY (do-it-yourself) approach to the heritage rock project that seeks to reinsert into rock history and rememberings those artists overlooked and ignored in more conservative accounts.	1	Andy Bennett
Pinheiro, Diogo & Timothy Dowd. 2009. 'All That Jazz: the Success of Jazz Musicians in Three Metropolitan Areas.' Poetics. 37:5, SI 490-506.	Poetics	2009	7	We draw on a survey of jazz musicians to examine their economic success (annual amount of money earned through music) and critical success (national recognition of their talent). In doing so, we bring together literatures that are not normally in dialogue-one addressing generalism and the careers of creative personnel and the other addressing the circulation of capitals (e.g., cultural capital) in fields of cultural production. We find, among other things, that aesthetic generalism (being conversant in a wide range of genres) has a positive impact on both earnings and national recognition-with veteran musicians particularly benefitting from the relationship between aesthetic generalism and critical success. Those musicians with much social capital (e.g., number of local musicians known by name) and much human capital (years of musical experience) enjoy heightened economic, but not critical, success. Technical generalism (playing a. wide range of musical instruments) has no bearing on economic success but has a negative impact on critical success-particularly for veteran jazz musicians. We discuss how such findings demonstrate the analytical utility of heeding the resources and ``signaled competencies'' that creative personnel have for negotiating fields of cultural production.	2	Diogo L.

Population Research and Policy Review	2009	4	Using Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey 2005 data, we estimate a Cox proportional hazard model to identify the determinants of age at marriage and age at first birth and whether these decisions were affected by conflict. We find that women living in clusters accounting for a larger proportion of sibling deaths in 1994, the year of the genocide, were more likely to marry later and have children later compared with those living in clusters accounting for a lower proportion of sibling deaths. Women living in regions with higher levels of under-five mortality were more likely to have their first child earlier compared with women living in regions with lower infant mortality. The age at marriage was probably affected by two reasons: the change in age structure and sex ratio of the population following the genocide, and the breakdown of kinship in the case of women who lost their siblings.	3	Anuja Jayaraman; Tesfayi Gebreselassie; S.

Population Research and Policy Review. 28:5 569-588.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	3	In this paper, we examine the determinants of fertility timing of unmarried and married mothers using a rich new birth cohort study, the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, drawn from 20 medium and large U. S. cities. We find considerable variation in the time to next birth among comparable mothers who live in different cities. Some of this variation is explained by variation in labor markets, housing costs and availability, and welfare policies. City variation is particularly important for unmarried women who already have two or more children, whose fertility is more sensitive to these contextual variables than is the fertility of married women, or unmarried women with just one child.	2	Marah A.

Porter, Jeremy & Frank Howell. 2009. 'on the `urbanness' of Metropolitan Areas: Testing the Homogeneity Assumption, 1970-2000.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:5 589-613.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	5	In recent decades, population dynamics, have made definitions of what localities are rural or urban somewhat unclear. The vast majority of demographic work has simply used metropolitan classifications with various forms of a non-metropolitan residual (e. g., adjacent to metro versus non-adjacent). The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) periodically redefines metropolitan areas, which makes temporal comparisons difficult. In fact, some demographers have offered the idea that, due to these shifting reclassifications, the so-called ``rural rebound'' is a misnomer, in that non-metropolitan counties that transitioned to metropolitan status were, in fact, already more `urban' than those that did not become reclassified as metropolitan (Johnson et al 2005). This argument depends largely on the assumption of homogeneity in rural or urban `character' in those counties. Following arguments by others (Wilkinson 1991; Isserman 2001; Bogue 1950), we take population and land use into account to examine whether these transitional counties were more or less urban than comparable others, all at the county level for the contiguous 48 states for 1970-2000. Our results show that adjacent non-metropolitan counties that were later reclassified as metropolitan were indeed characterized by a larger population and heavier urban land cover than those not making this transition. However, the results also show that metropolitan areas were also quite heterogeneous in terms of traditionally rural activities. A discussion of the homogeneity assumption in demographers' conceptualization of metropolitan areas is included.	2	Jeremy R. Porter; Frank M. Howell
Yount, Kathryn. 2009. 'Gender and Intergenerational Co-residence in Egypt and Tunisia.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:5 615-640.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	1	This paper compares the levels and determinants of intergenerational co-residence among older women and men in Egypt and Tunisia. Women in both settings have higher odds than do men of living in child-headed households, largely because women more often are widowed and have fewer economic resources. In Tunisia, women have higher odds than do men of living in child-headed households partly because of their poorer health. In Egypt, the odds of living in parent- and child-headed intergenerational households for unmarried compared to married older adults are higher for women than men. Disparate needs and marital histories likely contribute to the different living arrangements of older women and men in these settings.	1	Kathryn M. Yount
Croy, Calvin, Marjorie Bezdek, Christina Mitchell & Paul Spicer. 2009. 'Young Adult Migration From a Northern Plains Indian Reservation: Who Stays and Who Leaves.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:5 641-660.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	2	We evaluated how ambitions, community ties, monetary sufficiency, employment, and alcohol consumption related to whether young American Indian adults had moved from their Northern Plains reservation. Of 518 Northern Plains reservation residents in 1993, we located 472 in 2003-2005 and found that 89 lived more than a four-hour drive from the reservation. Coding the 472 as to whether they had stayed on/near the reservation or moved away, we ran logistic regressions on data they reported in 1996 to determine which demographic and attitudinal variables were associated with having moved. We found ambitions and goals were more associated with moving away than were ties to the community, which in turn were more related than monetary and personal characteristics that promote independence and prosperity. The more importance they placed on getting a good education or carrying on the tribe's traditions, the more likely they were to have moved away. We found too that the odds of moving away decreased with greater alcohol consumption. Tribal council members and college administrators therefore may wish to promote policies that increase opportunities for young adults to achieve higher education goals while remaining on reservation to carry on tribal traditions. Benefits may also come from encouraging and assisting reservation members studying off-reservation to return after completing their education. These findings would argue too for greater investment in alcohol services for reservation-dwelling populations.	4	Calvin D. Croy; Marjorie Bezdek; Christina M. Mitchell; Paul Spicer
Newman, Lareen. 2009. 'Do Socioeconomic Differences in Family Size Reflect Cultural Differences in Confidence and Social Support for Parenting?.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:5 661-691.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	4	This article details family size differences by socio-economic area in metropolitan South Australia and suggests that these differences may be linked to cultural differences in parenting confidence and skills, and in social supports for parenting. The paper analyses Census data on average completed family size and family size distribution in six different areas. In all age groups this shows a negative correlation between family size and the socio-economic status of the area. Secondly, based on analysis of interview data with 38 mothers and 24 fathers and a small survey of 44 parents-to-be, the article suggests that the quantitative patterns may partly reflect differences in the proportions of people in each area who see being parents and having larger families as desirable and achievable undertakings for which they have the requisite personal skills and social supports to minimise adverse impacts on their own parental health and lifestyle. The article concludes by hypothesising that differential fertility levels between groups or areas partly reflect differences in levels of confidence, skills and social support for parenting, and that a cultural ``crisis in parenthood'' as well as a greater focus on intensive parenting may be more widespread in higher status groups which is reflected in their lower fertility.	1	Lareen A.

Population Research and Policy Review. 28:5 693-720.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	1	Despite comparatively modest welfare reforms in Canada relative to those of the United States, employment rates and earnings among single mothers have risen by virtually identical magnitudes in the two countries since 1980. We show that most of the gains in Canada and a substantial share of the change in the US were the result of the dynamics of cohort replacement and population aging as the large and better educated baby boom generation replaced earlier cohorts and began entering their forties. In both countries, demographic effects were the main factor accounting for higher employment and earnings among older (40+) single mothers. Changes among younger single mothers, in contrast, were mainly the result of changes in labor market behavior and other unmeasured variables. Overall, demographic changes dominated in Canada but not in the US for two reasons: (a) Canadian single mothers are significantly older than their US counterparts; and (b) consistent with the welfare reform thesis, the magnitude of behavioral change among younger single mothers was much larger in the US.	4	John Myles; Feng Hou; Garnett Picot; Karen Myers

Social Networks	2009	10	Social network surveys are an important tool for empirical research in a variety of fields, including the study of social capital and the evaluation of educational and social policy. A growing body of methodological research sheds light on the validity and reliability of social network survey data regarding a single relation, but much less attention has been paid to the measurement of multiplex networks and the validity of comparisons among criterion relations. In this paper, we identify ways that surveys designed to collect multiplex social network data might be vulnerable to question-order effects. We then test several hypotheses using a split-ballot experiment embedded in an online Multiple name generator survey of teachers' advice networks, collected for a study of complete networks. We conclude by discussing implications for the design of multiple name generator social network surveys.	2	James E. Pustejovsky; James P. Spillane

Social Networks. 31:4 230-239.	Social Networks	2009	8	Social discrimination, defined as the relative preference for intra-ethnic over inter-ethnic relationships, was studied in pupils' networks in Dutch secondary school classes. While native Dutch pupils (ethnic majority members) mainly named fellow majority members, ethnic minority members reported ties with as many majority as minority members. Considering the ethnic composition of the classroom, however. majority members discriminated less than minorities. No strong effect of classroom ethnic composition on social discrimination was found, whereas neighborhood composition was shown to clearly influence social discrimination: ethnic minority members were more, and majority members less inclined to discriminate in neighborhoods with more ethnic presence.	3	Lotte Vermeij; Marijtje A.

'a Comparative Study of Social Network Models: Network Evolution Models and Nodal Attribute Models.' Social Networks. 31:4 240-254.	Social Networks	2009	17	This paper reviews, classifies and compares recent models for social networks that have mainly been published within the physics-oriented complex networks literature. The models fall into two categories: those in which the addition of new links is dependent on the (typically local) network structure (network evolution models, NEMs), and those in which links are generated based only on nodal attributes (nodal attribute models, NAMs). An exponential random graph model (ERGM) with structural dependencies is included for comparison. We fit models from each of these categories to two empirical acquaintance networks with respect to basic network properties. We compare higher order structures in the resulting networks with those in the data, with the aim of determining which models produce the most realistic network structure with respect to degree distributions, assortativity, clustering spectra, geodesic path distributions, and community structure (subgroups with dense internal connections). We find that the nodal attribute models successfully produce assortative networks and very clear community structure. However, they generate unrealistic clustering spectra and peaked degree distributions that do not match empirical data on large social networks. On the other hand, many of the network evolution models produce degree distributions and clustering spectra that agree more closely with data. They also generate assortative networks and community structure, although often not to the same extent as in the data. The ERGM model, which turned out to be near-degenerate in the parameter region best fitting our data, produces the weakest community structure.	6	Riitta Toivonen; Lauri Kovanen; Mikko Kivela; Jukka-Pekka Onnela; Jari Saramaki; Kimmo Kaski
Grippa, Francesca & Peter Gloor. 2009. 'You Are Who Remembers You. Detecting Leadership Through Accuracy of Recall.' Social Networks. 31:4 255-261.	Social Networks	2009	0	We measured interpersonal perception accuracy by focusing on the relationship between actors' centrality and their ability to accurately report their social interactions. We used the network measures of actors' betweenness centrality and degree centrality to identify the most prominent members by correlating ego-perception and alter-perception in a ``non-reciprocity'' type of misalignment. We found a positive correlation between actors' centrality and their centrality as assessed by senior management, and a negative correlation between actors' centrality and their accuracy in recalling interactions. Under-reporting social interactions may represent a third way of measuring the importance of members and finding the most influential actors.	2	Francesca Grippa; Peter A. Gloor
Stephen, Andrew & Olivier Toubia. 2009. 'Explaining the Power-law Degree Distribution in a Social Commerce Network.' Social Networks. 31:4 262-270.	Social Networks	2009	12	Social commerce is an emerging trend in which online shops create referral hyperlinks to other shops in the same online marketplace. We study the evolution of a social commerce network in a large online marketplace. Our dataset starts before the birth of the network (at which points shops were not linked to each other) and includes the birth of the network. The network under study exhibits a typical power-law degree distribution. We empirically compare a set of edge formation mechanisms (including preferential attachment and triadic closure) that may explain the emergence of this property. Our results suggest that the evolution of the network and the emergence of its power-law degree distribution are better explained by a network evolution mechanism that relies on vertex attributes that are not based on the structure of the network. Specifically, Our analysis suggests that the power-law degree distribution emerges because shops prefer to connect to shops with more diverse assortments, and assortment diversity follows a power-law distribution. Shops with more diverse assortments are more attractive to link to because they are more likely to bring traffic from consumers browsing the WWW. Therefore, our results also imply that social commerce networks should not be studied in isolation, but rather in the context of the broader network in which they are embedded (the WWW).	2	Andrew T.

Gonzalez-Bailon, Sandra. 2009. 'Opening the Black Box of Link Formation: Social Factors Underlying the Structure of the Web.' Social Networks. 31:4 271-280.	Social Networks	2009	7	Links play a twofold role on the web: they open the channels through which users access information, and they determine the centrality of sites and their visibility. This paper adds two factors to the analysis of links that aim to draw a parallel between the web and other offline interorganisational networks: the resources that the organisations publishing online are able to mobilise, and the status or public recognition of those organisations. Exponential random graph models (ERGMs) are used to analyse a sample of the web of about one thousand sites, showing that both the economic resources of the producers of the sites (a proxy to their wider pool of resources) and their presence in traditional news media (a proxy to their status) significantly increase their probability of receiving more links, and therefore, their centrality. This adds a sociologically relevant dimension to the analysis of the web that has been disregarded so far but that is crucial to understand the way it distributes visibility.	1	Sandra Gonzalez-Bailon
Fletcher, Jason & Marta Tienda. 2009. 'High School Classmates and College Success.' Sociology of Education. 82:4 287-314.	Sociology of Education	2009	7	This article uses administrative data from the University of Texas at Austin to examine whether the number of classmates from the same high school at college entry influences college achievement, measured by grade point average (GPA) and persistence. For each freshman cohort from 1993 through 2003, the authors calculated the number and ethnic makeup of college freshmen from each Texas high school. Empirical specifications included high school fixed effects to control for unobservable differences across schools that influence both college enrollment behavior and academic performance. Using an instrumental variables-fixed-effects estimation strategy, they also evaluated whether ``marginal'' increases in the number of high school classmates influence college grades. The results show that students who arrive on campus with a larger number of high school classmates outperform their counterparts from smaller high school cohorts. The average effects of larger high school cohorts on college achievement are small, but a marginal increase in the number of same-race classmates raises the GPA by 0.1 point. The results provide suggestive evidence that minority academic benefits from larger high school cohorts are greater for minority compared with white students.	2	Jason M. Fletcher; Marta Tienda
McFarland, Daniel & Simon Rodan. 2009. 'Organization by Design: Supply- and Demand-side Models of Mathematics Course Taking.' Sociology of Education. 82:4 315-343.	Sociology of Education	2009	2	Prior work has proposed different theoretical mechanisms to explain students' course-taking patterns in schools. On the one hand, there are oversocialized accounts that claim that rules, social background factors, and supply-side factors shape observed career patterns. On the other hand, there are undersocialized accounts that claim that the decisions of strategic agents and demand-side dynamics shape course-taking careers. In this article, the authors use simulations to illustrate how these theoretical mechanisms can generate course-taking patterns. Grounding the simulations in empirical data on the mathematics course taking of students in two high schools, they assess the relative merits of these competing theories by testing how closely observed and predicted career patterns align. The results reveal that the characteristics of students and the organizational rules and requirements of course-taking career systems render certain allocation mechanisms more salient than others. In particular, highly competitive and structurally constrained systems are shaped by supply dynamics, while less regulated systems of diverse populations are shaped by agent-based decision making.	2	Daniel A.

Erickson, Lance, Steve McDonald & Glen Elder. 2009. 'Informal Mentors and Education: Complementary or Compensatory Resources?.' Sociology of Education. 82:4 344-367.	Sociology of Education	2009	16	Few studies have examined the impact of mentoring (developing a special relationship with a nonparental adult) on educational achievement and attainment in the general population. In addition, prior research has yet to clarify the extent to which mentoring relationships reduce inequality by enabling disadvantaged youths to compensate for the lack of social resources or to promote inequality by serving as a complementary resource for advantaged youths. The results of a nationally representative sample of youths show (1) a powerful net influence of mentors on the educational success of youths and (2) how social background and parental, peer, and personal resources condition the formation and effectiveness of mentoring relationships. The findings uncover an interesting paradox-that informal mentors may simultaneously represent compensatory and complementary resources. Youths with many resources are more likely than are other young people to have mentors, but those with few resources are likely to benefit more from having a mentor-particularly a teacher mentor-in their lives.	3	Lance D.

Hirschfield, Paul. 2009. 'Another Way Out: the Impact of Juvenile Arrests on High School Dropout.' Sociology of Education. 82:4 368-393.	Sociology of Education	2009	3	This article suggests that contact with the legal system increased school dropout in a Chicago sample of 4,844 inner-city students. According to multilevel multivariate logistic models, students who were first arrested during the 9th or 10th grade were six to eight times more likely than were nonarrested students ever to dropout of high school and are about 3.5 times more likely to drop out in Grades 9 and 10. However, selection bias is a real concern. To improve causal inference, students who were first arrested in Grade 9 (n = 228) are compared to 9th graders (n = 153) who were first arrested a year later. Given this sampling restriction, the groups hardly differ on many observables. Yet early arrest still increases early school dropout in models with many relevant covariates. The 9th-grade arrestees are also compared to matched students who avoided arrest. Similar intergroup differences in the risk of dropout were observed. Thus, being arrested weakens subsequent participation in urban schools, decreasing their capacity to educate and otherwise help vulnerable youths.	1	Paul Hirschfield
Bingham, Shawn & Alexander Hernandez. 2009. '``laughing Matters'': the Comedian as Social Observer, Teacher, and Conduit of the Sociological Perspective.' Teaching Sociology. 37:4 335-352.	Teaching Sociology	2009	3	Much of the sociological curriculum often represents society as tragedy. This article explores the incorporation of a society as comedy component in introductory courses at two institutions using the sociological insight and social critique of comedians. A general discussion of parallels between the comedic eye and the sociological imagination is followed by specific steps for locating, selecting and incorporating comedic clips into various courses. Through comparisons between experimental and control groups, as well as student questionnaires, we found that the use of comedians to model sociological perspectives increased student ability to apply course concepts, decreased student anxiety when tackling new concepts, and engaged a broader number of students during class discussion. We conclude with discussion of challenges specific to these methods-language use and controversial comedians-as well as the broader need to learn from figures who have been historically successful at engaging the public on issues of social importance.	2	Shawn Chandler Bingham; Alexander A.

Kebede, Alem. 2009. 'Practicing Sociological Imagination Through Writing Sociological Autobiography.' Teaching Sociology. 37:4 353-368.	Teaching Sociology	2009	3	Sociological imagination is a quality of mind that cannot be adopted by simply teaching students its discursive assumptions. Rather, it is a disposition, in competition with other forms of sensibility, which can be acquired only when it is practiced. Adhering to this important pedagogical assumption, students were assigned to write their sociological autobiography. While in the process of establishing a connection between their biography and social history, students were encouraged to narrate their life stories using sociological language. After completing the project, they were asked to comment on their work. Student responses show the positive dimensions involved (including unintended therapeutic consequences) and the major hurdles that they experienced in executing the assignment. In the latter case, the major problem was writing a sociological autobiography qualitatively distinct from what might be referred to as ``plain autobiography.'' Results reinforce the idea that sociological instruction is better handled when sociological imagination is viewed as a linguistic habitus which serves both as a medium of communication and an intellectual instrument of looking at the social world.	1	Alem Kebede

Grant, Don, Alfonso Morales & Jeff Sallaz. 2009. 'Pathways to Meaning: a New Approach to Studying Emotions at Work.' American Journal of Sociology. 115:2 327-364.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	8	Research on the emotional consequences of interactive service work remains inconclusive in large part because scholars have not analyzed the mechanisms that lead frontline employees to adopt the meanings disseminated by their employers. The authors argue that the theoretical framework best suited for remedying this situation is the negotiated order perspective. It suggests that whether employees adopt a corporate-sanctioned meaning, and with what emotional effect, depends on the conjunction of several social conditions. The authors also propose a novel analytical strategy that can identify these conditional pathways and formalize the combinatorial logic of the negotiated order perspective: fuzzy-set techniques. To illustrate the utility of this approach, the article examines a university hospital that has tried to create a more meaningful and emotionally rewarding work environment for its nursing staff. Consistent with expectations, findings show that employees can embrace the same corporate-sanctioned meaning under different sets of conditions and with different emotional consequences.	3	Don Grant; Alfonso Morales; Jeff Sallaz
Kane, Danielle & Jung Park. 2009. 'the Puzzle of Korean Christianity: Geopolitical Networks and Religious Conversion in Early Twentieth-century East Asia.' American Journal of Sociology. 115:2 365-404.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	3	This article uses the puzzle of Christian success in Korea to develop a model for understanding religious diffusion beyond national borders. The authors argue that the microlevel network explanations that dominate the research on conversion cannot by themselves account for the unusual success of Protestantism in Korea. Instead, events in East Asia in macrolevel, geopolitical networks provoked nationalist rituals that altered the stakes of conversion to either promote or retard conversion network growth. At the turn of the 20th century, unequal treaties both opened this region to missionaries and provoked nationalist rituals. In China and Japan, these rituals generated patriotic identities by attacking Christianity, and network growth slowed or reversed. In Korea, Christianity became compatible with these rituals, and conversion networks grew. This example highlights the greater explanatory power of nested networks for understanding international religious diffusion, relative to microlevel accounts alone.	2	Danielle Kane; Jung Mee Park
Kossinets, Gueorgi & Duncan Watts. 2009. 'Origins of Homophily in an Evolving Social Network.' American Journal of Sociology. 115:2 405-450.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	38	The authors investigate the origins of homophily in a large university community, using network data in which interactions, attributes, and affiliations are all recorded over time. The analysis indicates that highly similar pairs do show greater than average propensity to form new ties; however, it also finds that tie formation is heavily biased by triadic closure and focal closure, which effectively constrain the opportunities among which individuals may select. In the case of triadic closure, moreover, selection to ``friend of a friend'' status is determined by an analogous combination of individual preference and structural proximity. The authors conclude that the dynamic interplay of choice homophily and induced homophily, compounded over many ``generations'' of biased selection of similar individuals to structurally proximate positions, can amplify even a modest preference for similar others, via a cumulative advantage like process, to produce striking patterns of observed homophily.	2	Gueorgi Kossinets; Duncan J.

Willer, Robb, Ko Kuwabara & Michael Macy. 2009. 'the False Enforcement of Unpopular Norms.' American Journal of Sociology. 115:2 451-490.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	13	Prevailing theory assumes that people enforce norms in order to pressure others to act in ways that they approve. Yet there are numerous examples of ``unpopular norms'' in which people compel each other to do things that they privately disapprove. While peer sanctioning suggests a ready explanation for why people conform to unpopular norms, it is harder to understand why they would enforce a norm they privately oppose. The authors argue that people enforce unpopular norms to show that they have complied out of genuine conviction and not because of social pressure. They use laboratory experiments to demonstrate this ``false enforcement'' in the context of a wine tasting and an academic text evaluation. Both studies find that participants who conformed to a norm due to social pressure then falsely enforced the norm by publicly criticizing a lone deviant. A third study shows that enforcement of a norm effectively signals the enforcer's genuine support for the norm. These results demonstrate the potential for a vicious cycle in which perceived pressures to conform to and falsely enforce an unpopular norm reinforce one another.	3	Robb Willer; Ko Kuwabara; Michael W.

O'Hearn, Denis. 2009. 'Repression and Solidary Cultures of Resistance: Irish Political Prisoners on Protest.' American Journal of Sociology. 115:2 491-526.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	3	Social activists and especially insurgents have created solidary cultures of resistance in conditions of high risk and repression. One such instance is an episode of contention by Irish political prisoners in the late 1970s. The ``blanketmen'' appropriated and then built a solidary culture within spaces that had been under official control. Their ability to maintain such a collective response was enhanced by an intensifying cycle of protest and violent reprisal, including extreme stripping of their material environment, in which the prisoners gained considerable initiative. This study uses interviews and contemporary writings by prisoners, prison authorities, visitors, and movement activists to examine how the dynamic of protest and repression transformed insurgent prison culture-through material, emotional, and perceptive changes-and the importance of leadership in the transformation. Special attention is given to prisoner activities in appropriated spaces that reinforced the culture of resistance: promoting the Irish language, cultural production, and the production of propaganda.	1	Denis O'Hearn

American Journal of Sociology	2009	17	Persistent racial residential segregation is often seen as the result of preferences: whites prefer to live with whites while blacks wish to live near many other blacks. Are these neighborhood preferences color-blind or race conscious? Does neighborhood racial composition have a net influence upon preferences, or is race a proxy for social class? This article tests the racial proxy hypothesis using an innovative experiment that isolates the net effects of race and social class, followed by an analysis of the social psychological factors associated with residential preferences. The authors find that net of social class, the race of a neighborhood's residents significantly influenced how it was rated. Whites said the all-white neighborhoods were most desirable. The independent effect of racial composition was smaller among blacks, who identified the racially mixed neighborhood as most desirable. Further, whites who held negative stereotypes about African-Americans and the neighborhoods where they live were significantly influenced by neighborhood racial composition. None of the proposed social psychological factors conditioned African-Americans' sensitivity to neighborhood racial composition.	4	Maria Krysan; Mick P. Couper; Reynolds Farley; Tyrone A. Forman
Gans, Herbert. 2009. 'Some Problems of and Futures for Urban Sociology: Toward a Sociology of Settlements.' City \& Community. 8:3 211-219.	City \& Community	2009	3	Forty years ago, Manuel Castells asked whether urban sociology had a subject matter and whether the term urban still had meaning-and this article reopens these and related questions. It also wonders why today's American urban sociology has concentrated on cities, especially big ones, concurrently virtually ignoring the three other types of communities-suburbs, towns, and rural areas-in which a majority of Americans live and work. Further, it argues that this four-community typology is logically dubious and empirically obsolete. If the field were redefined as a sociology of settlements, analytically more logical and substantively more relevant typologies could be developed. Another politically and organizationally more realistic alternative would split the field into four: a sociology of the city and one concentrating on other settlements, with a third field devoted to community studies, and the fourth to spatial sociology.	1	Herbert J.

City \& Community	2009	11	Inner-ring suburbs initially built in the postwar period and before have evolved into places with varied characteristics, assets, and problems. Analyzing a sample of 1,742 inner-ring suburbs nationwide, this article identifies five different types: ``vulnerable;'' ``ethnic;'' ``lower income and mixed;'' ``old;'' and ``middle class.'' This typology indicates that inner-ring suburbs, often perceived as homogenous entities, are in fact places largely differentiated by issues of class, race, and ethnicity. As this article demonstrates, the identification of these different types of inner-ring suburbs reveals much about suburban transformation, stability, and decline in the United States.	1	Bernadette Hanlon
McQuarrie, Michael & Nicole Marwell. 2009. 'the Missing Organizational Dimension in Urban Sociology.' City \& Community. 8:3 247-268.	City \& Community	2009	4	Our article takes issue with the treatment of organizations in much urban sociology. We argue that both Marxian political economists and Chicagoan ethnographers and quantitative analysts treat organizations as derivative rather than productive of urban social relations. This problem is not epistemological or methodological. Instead, it is rooted in the objects of analysis that urban sociologists choose. Drawing on key elements of structuration theory, we attempt to lay the groundwork for improving the treatment of organizations in urban sociology by flagging some of the key insights in the sociology of organizations. We do not view this intellectual borrowing as a one-way street, and we emphasize that urbanists have a contribution to make to sociological thinking about organizations. Correcting these problems is essential if we are to understand the link between contemporary institutional transformations and urban neighborhoods.	2	Michael McQuarrie; Nicole P. Marwell
Tach, Laura. 2009. 'More Than Bricks and Mortar: Neighborhood Frames, Social Processes, and the Mixed-income Redevelopment of a Public Housing Project.' City \& Community. 8:3 269-299.	City \& Community	2009	8	Policy initiatives to deconcentrate poverty through mixed-income redevelopment were motivated in part by the desire to reduce social isolation and social disorganization in high-poverty neighborhoods. This article examines whether the presence of higher-income neighbors decreased social isolation or improved social organization in a Boston public housing project that was redeveloped into a HOPE VI mixed-income community. Based on in-depth interviews and neighborhood observation, I find that it was the lower-income former public housing residents who were primarily involved in creating neighborhood-based social ties, providing and receiving social support, and enforcing social control within the neighborhood, rather than the higher-income newcomers. This variation in neighborhood engagement stemmed from the different ways that long-term and newer residents perceived and interpreted their neighborhood surroundings. These differences were generated by residents' comparisons of current and past neighborhood environments and by neighborhood reputations. Residents' perceptions of place may thus influence whether mixed-income redevelopment can reduce social isolation and improve social organization in high-poverty neighborhoods and, more generally, whether changes in neighborhood structural characteristics translate into changes in social dynamics.	1	Laura M.

Lee, Caroline. 2009. 'Conservation as a Territorial Ideology.' City \& Community. 8:3 301-328.	City \& Community	2009	0	Growth machine theory has typically interpreted successful contemporary conservation efforts as rare victories of elite liberal factions to protect their own use values or, alternatively, as greenwashing for growth. By studying an elite coalition dedicated to land conservation in the South Carolina Lowcountry, I probe whether growth theory can be used to understand conservation as a territorial ideology in its own right. Intensive interviewing and qualitative content analysis reveal that the conservation coalition uses backstage networking to promote conservation as a homegrown civic virtue. Comparing newspaper coverage of conservation and development projects opposed by the coalition, I demonstrate that the conservation coalition's policing of conservation-related profiteering has occasionally put it at odds with the larger public and its own ideological framing. The conservation coalition's inversion of dominant cultural scripts of growth promotion demonstrates that growth theory can be productively applied to unusual cases.	1	Caroline W. Lee

Tavory, Iddo & Stefan Timmermans. 2009. 'Two Cases of Ethnography Grounded Theory and the Extended Case Method.' Ethnography. 10:3 243-263.	Ethnography	2009	3	Sociological ethnography largely draws upon two epistemologically competing perspectives - grounded theory and the extended case method - with a different conceptualization of sociological case-construction and theory. We argue that the sociological case in the extended case method is foremost a form of theoretical framing: relying on theoretical narratives to delineate the boundaries of an empirical field. Grounded theory follows the tenets of Chicago School ethnography where the sociological case is elicited from ethno-narratives of actors in the field: the institutionally and interactionally delimited ways members in the field `case' their action. This difference in sociological casing, in turn, is reflected in the ways theory is used. Where the extended case method uses theoretical narratives as a denouement of the case, grounded theory employs theory to construct a grammar of social life.	2	Iddo Tavory; Stefan Timmermans
Forsberg, Per. 2009. 'Testing Prices in Markets How to Charter a Tanker.' Ethnography. 10:3 265-290.	Ethnography	2009	0	This article is written to follow up on a discussion initiated by Callon and Muniesa (2005) who criticized the distinction between pure calculation (assumed in neoclassical economics) and pure judgment (assumed in ethnographic studies). They suggested a third perspective: calculations are performed by technological devices. Furthermore, they call this process `the qualification process' and claim that it brings calculation and judgment together. However, in this third perspective, the meaning of judgment is reduced and has become synonymous with making distinctions. I argue that an understanding of real markets must consider two parallel processes: a `calculative process' and a `judgmental process'. In the real market both a `calculative process' and a `judgmental process' involve a process where the buyer and seller `test' different prices. When it comes to the judgmental process storytelling is an indispensable cultural tool. This is demonstrated using field material collected at a tanker chartering firm.	1	Per Forsberg
Bubandt, Nils. 2009. 'Interview With an Ancestor Spirits as Informants and the Politics of Possession in North Maluku.' Ethnography. 10:3 291-316.	Ethnography	2009	4	This article explores the relationship between spirit possession, politics and subjectivity. Based on an account of two possession ceremonies on the island of Ternate in eastern Indonesia, I show that as spirits are being conjured up for political reasons, they partake in a spiritual politics in which they are both instruments and actors. Methodologically, I use these accounts to suggest the need to treat spirits as informants. From this I develop a critique of the continuing link between the anthropological concept of the informant and conventional ideas about bounded subjectivity, a link that remains unquestioned despite much contemporary anthropological research into the complexity of lived subjectivity. Analytically, I argue that treating spirits as informants reveals how possession rituals construct and make intelligible a particular relationship between politics, experience and emerging democracy in Indonesia. Treating spirits as `methodologically real' therefore has important analytical consequences for how we understand their political efficacy.	1	Nils Bubandt
Thorne, Barrie. 2009. 'the Seven Up! Films Connecting the Personal and the Sociological.' Ethnography. 10:3 327-340.	Ethnography	2009	1	Michael Apted's documentary film series, which tracks 14 British children as they move from ages seven to 49, connects the personal with the sociological. Organized around the phenomenology of `growing older together' (Schutz, 1976), the films invite emotional identification as they go about exploring unique, shared, and fluctuating experiences of the self. The documentaries resonate with the work of ethnographers who revisit the field, who seek to craft coherent narratives from a surplus of material, and who confront ethical problems as they investigate the private lives of subjects. The Seven Up! linear narrative of social class determination loosened in subsequent films as contingency, variation, and the dynamics of gender, generation, and parenting came more fully into view. The films embed tensions between linear and contingent, open-ended forms of temporality, juxtaposing varied forms of time: subjective (with fluctuating orientations of consciousness), physical aging, personal maturation, life course, biographical, historical, and generational.	1	Barrie Thorne

International Migration Review	2009	8	This article examines patterns of post-1965 native-born Asian Americans' intermarriages and cross-generational in-marriages using a combined sample of the 2001-2006 American Community Surveys from the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series. The analysis focuses on ethnic and gender differences in intermarriage and cross-generational in-marriage rates and patterns. About 55 percent of native-born Asian Americans are found to be intermarried while another 23 percent are married to 1.5-generation or first-generation co-ethnic immigrants. Thus only 22 percent of native-born Asian Americans are married to co-ethnic native-born Asian Americans. As expected, there are significant ethnic and gender differences in intermarriage and cross-generational in-marriage rates and patterns. This study is significant because it is the first study that has examined intermarriage patterns among post-1965 native-born Asian Americans, the majority of whom are likely to be children of post-1965 Asian immigrants, using the most recent Census data available. It is also significant for studies of the new second generation in general in that it is the first study to show patterns of cross-generational in-marriage among members of the new second generation.	2	Pyong Gap Min; Chigon Kim

In addition, we observe worse health among U.S.-born Mexican Americans relative to non-Hispanic Whites. Finally, although our theory suggests that recent immigrants may have latent health risks due to disadvantaged childhood experiences, we do not find evidence in support of this theory.	4	Brian K.

International Migration Review	2009	25	Our understanding of the underlying demographic components of population change in new Hispanic destinations is limited. In this paper, we (1) compare Hispanic migration patterns in traditional settlement areas with new growth in emerging Hispanic destinations; (2) examine the role of immigration vis--vis domestic migration in spurring Hispanic population redistribution; and (3) document patterns of migrant selectivity, distinguishing between in-migrants and non-migrant Hispanics at both the origin and destination. We use several recent datasets, including the 1990 and 2000 Public Use Microdata Samples (which include new regional geocodes), and the 2005 and 2006 files of the American Community Survey. Our results document the widespread dispersion of the Hispanic population over the 1990-2006 period from established Hispanic gateways into new Hispanic areas and other parts of the country. Nearly one-half of Hispanic net migration in new destinations comes from domestic gains. In contrast, both established and other Hispanic areas depend entirely on immigration, with each losing domestic migrants to high growth areas. Migrant flows also are highly differentiated by education, citizenship, and nativity. To fully understand the spatial diffusion of Hispanics requires a new appreciation of the complex interplay among immigration, internal domestic migration, and fertility.	2	Daniel T.

International Migration Review	2009	3	This article proposes a dynamic perspective on immigrants' language proficiency. Hypotheses are formulated about immigrants' language skills at arrival and about the speed with which immigrants learn the language thereafter. It pools data from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 U.S. Censuses, and uses a synthetic cohort design to analyze the language skills of immigrants within the first 20 years after migration. Multilevel models show that higher educated immigrants arrive with better language skills and learn the language quicker. Group size has a double-negative effect: it attracts less skilled immigrants, and it hampers language learning. These and other determinants are discussed in light of current research on immigrants' second-language proficiency.	2	Frank Tubergen; Matthijs Kalmijn

International Migration Review	2009	5	Southern and Eastern Mediterranean (SEM) countries have recently turned into receivers of migrants, but they have neither the institutions nor the policies that would allow them to integrate migrants. Therefore, most migrants in SEM countries found themselves in irregular situation. Using a variety of statistical sources, official and non-official, the article establishes that out of 5.6 million immigrants living in SEM countries in the mid-2000s, a minimum of 3.6 would be in irregular situation. They belong to three categories: approximately 2 million migrant workers attracted by SEM labour markets where they are employed in the informal sector with no work permit, 1.5 million de facto refugees who cannot obtain the status of refugee and are waiting for resettlement in a third country or return to their homes, and less than 200,000 transit migrants initially bound for Europe, which they are unable to reach for lack of visa. While their reasons to be stranded in the SEM differ, these three categories share the same vulnerable conditions, with no legal access to work, services, or protection.	1	Philippe Fargues

International Migration Review	2009	11	Unlike states in Europe, East Asia settles very few migrants and has not developed a European-style multicultural society. We seek to explain this variation using comparative analysis of two of the most advanced states in East Asia, South Korea and Japan, with several states in Europe. Focusing on family reunification - almost always the precursor to migrant settlement - we examine the effects of several independent variables, including supranational institutions, independent courts, interest groups, political culture, and the perceptions of migrants. We conclude that both Korea and Japan have less migrant settlement because of the lack of regional institutions pushing for family reunification rights, an elite political culture that still maintains the assumptions and repertoires of a ``developmental state,'' where rights may be sacrificed for economic growth and order, and migrant perceptions of greater immigration control in Asia.	2	Dong-Hoon Seol; John D.

We use data from the Chitwan Valley Family Study to estimate a series of discrete time event history models of first and repeat migration to three competing destinations: other locations within Chitwan, other districts within Nepal, and places outside of Nepal. Results support hypotheses derived from neoclassical economics, the theory of new economics of migration, social capital theory, and cumulative causation theory. Our results underscore the need for a synthetic theoretical model that incorporates factors operating at the individual, household, and community levels. The use of multiple explanatory models yields a clearer picture of the forces driving internal and international migration from rural districts in developing nations such as Nepal.	2	Pratikshya Bohra; Douglas S.

I eschew too technical a presentation in order to reach not only academics but also NGOs and journalists, the drivers of today's rights movements.	1	Roger Boehning
Martin, Philip. 2009. 'Recession and Migration: a New Era for Labor Migration?.' International Migration Review. 43:3 671-691.	International Migration Review	2009	16	The current recession, the worst in a half century, is likely to affect international migration differently than past recessions. In 1973-1974 and 1981-1982, rising oil prices led to recessions in oil-importing countries and economic booms in oil-exporting countries, enabling some migrants to shift from bust to boom areas, as from Europe to the Middle East. The 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis did not spread globally, and was followed by a relatively quick resumption of economic and job growth that attracted migrant workers. The 2008-2009 recession is most severe in countries that had the most severe debt excesses, including the U.S., Spain, and Eastern Europe, and in countries most dependent on trade, including many Asian countries. New deployments of migrants are likely to slow, but what is not yet clear is how many migrants who lose jobs will remain abroad.	1	Philip Martin

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	2	The relationship between the material culture of public worship and congregants' homes is explored in a study of two Catholic parishes-theologically liberal St. Brigitta and conservative Our Lady of Assumption. At St. Brigitta, congregants' worship space is almost devoid of religious art and ritual objects are plain, but worshippers' homes are rich in decorative objects. By contrast, masses at Our Lady of the Assumption take place in a church filled with devotional art and ornate objects, but worshippers' homes are spare, neutrally furnished, and display few decorations. Distinct congregational logics surrounding the making of the self help to explain the material culture differences: St. Brigitta parishioners value individualized self-expression whereas Assumption's members subordinate individuality to family and church identities. Individuals use material objects not only for self-expression, but also to explicitly shape identities and make the self.	1	Mary Ellen Konieczny

It applies this trade-off hypothesis to confession of sins to priests, an institution that epitomizes such intermediation, showing that this hypothesis fits cognitive, historical, and econometric evidence better than a simpler rent-seeking story. In particular, Catholics who confess more often are observed to comply more with the moral code; however, no relationship is observed between mass attendance and moral compliance.	1	Benito Arrunada

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	3	In the globalization discourse, Christianity and Islam are often construed as representing two traditions that are conflicted and incompatible.

Employing data from six nationally representative surveys conducted in the two countries between 1990 and 2004 and multilevel logistic regression, we find that the effects of religion remain strong but operate largely through the community religious milieu. Contraceptive use tends to be highest in religiously mixed areas, but the ``optimal'' religious makeup differs between the two nations, reflecting the historically shaped configurations of their religious expressions and politics.	3	Victor Agadjanian; Scott T.

We examine salience of belief in three traditions: aboriginal, Christian, and Native American Church. We then investigate patterns in sociodemographic subgroups, determining the significant correlates of salience with other variables controlled. Finally, we examine frequency with which respondents assign high salience to only one tradition (exclusivity) or multiple traditions (nonexclusivity), again investigating subgroup variations. This first detailed, statistical portrait of American Indian religious and spiritual lives links work on tribal ethnic identity to theoretical work on America's ``religious marketplace.'' Results may also inform social/behavioral interventions that incorporate religiospiritual elements.	10	Eva M. Garroutte; Janette Beals; Ellen M.

Berger, Helen & Douglas Ezzy. 2009. 'Mass Media and Religious Identity: a Case Study of Young Witches.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 48:3 501-514.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	7	Drawing on interviews with 90 young people who have become Witches, we explore the visual media's influence on identity formation and maintenance. Witchcraft is a late modern religion that is highly individualistic and many young people report they have become a Witch without any interaction with other Witches. The rapid growth of interest in this religion among the young since The Craft was first shown provides an important example of the mass media's role in formation of contemporary religious identity. We argue that representations of Witchcraft in the visual mass media (along with other cultural trends such as environmentalism, feminism, and individualism) and cultural resources such as books, Internet sites, and magazines provide a mediated form of social interaction that sustains the plausibility of Witchcraft as a religion. It also helps the young to develop and legitimate their beliefs and practices and develop their Witchcraft persona.	2	Helen A. Berger; Douglas Ezzy
Hill, Jonathan. 2009. 'Higher Education as Moral Community: Institutional Influences on Religious Participation During College.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 48:3 515-534.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	12	Borrowing from the literature on religion and deviance, the concept of moral communities is applied to religious and secular postsecondary education to explain institutional influences on student religious participation. Results from nationally representative panel data indicate that students attending Catholic and mainline Protestant affiliated institutions decline in religious participation at a faster rate than students attending evangelical institutions or students attending nonreligious public colleges and universities. This finding is consistent with Catholic and mainline Protestant institutions less successfully providing a shared moral order that legitimates religious language, motive, and behavior when compared to conservative Protestant colleges. At the same time, the religious and ethnic pluralism that activates minority religious identity at nonreligious public institutions is also less likely to be present on Catholic and mainline Protestant college campuses. Additional results indicate that evangelical students' religious participation declines while attending Catholic colleges and universities, while Catholic students increase their participation while attending evangelical institutions. The religious composition of students may act to alter friendship networks, and thus participation rates, on these campuses, although further research is necessary to validate the proposed institutional mechanisms.	1	Jonathan P.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	10	Recent attention from media, scholars, and religious leadership has focused on the dating activities of college students, particularly in relation to casual physical encounters or what some have termed ``hooking up.'' In this article, we examine the impact of both individual and institutional religious involvement on ``hooking up'' in a national sample of college women (N = 1,000). The results of our analysis reveal several important patterns. First, Catholic college women are more likely to have ``hooked up'' while at school than college women with no religious affiliation. Second, conservative Protestant college women are less likely to have ``hooked up'' while at school than college women with no religious affiliation; however, this difference is mediated or explained by church attendance, which is protective against ``hooking up.'' Finally, women who attend colleges and universities with a Catholic affiliation are more likely to have hooked up while at school than women who attend academic institutions with no religious affiliation, net of individual-level religious involvement.	4	Amy M.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	16	Using a life course approach, this study examines trajectories of religious participation from early adolescence through young adulthood. Distinct patterns of religious participation are identified, providing insight into how trajectories are shaped by family and religious characteristics and demonstrating the influence of life events on changes in religious participation. The study employs a group-based method of trajectory analysis, identifying three trajectories of stable religious participation (nonattendance, occasional attendance, and frequent attendance) and three trajectories of change (early, late, and gradual declining attendance). Residing with two biological parents and in a religious family increases the likelihood that youth attend religious services throughout adolescence. Religious disaffiliation is associated with lower religious participation for youth in all trajectories; marriage, cohabitation, and religious switching/conversion are associated with changes in participation among youth in the frequent and occasional attendance trajectories only.	1	Richard J.

Studies show that religion typically results in positive life outcomes for youth, but less is known about the causal mechanisms through which religion makes a difference in their lives. Data analyzed are from two waves of the National Study of Youth and Religion (NSYR). This article examines the effect of youth participation on adult support, church connections, and moral values. A multivariate analysis with lagged dependent variables indicates some effects of youth group participation as well as self-selection processes.	1	Patricia Snell
Valle, Eunice, Leticia Fernandez & Joseph Potter. 2009. 'Religious Affiliation, Ethnicity, and Child Mortality in Chiapas, Mexico.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 48:3 588-603.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	1	We investigate whether there is a relationship between religious affiliation and child mortality among indigenous and nonindigenous groups in Chiapas, Mexico. Our analysis relies on Brass-type estimates of child mortality by ethnicity and religious affiliation and multivariate analyses that adjust for various socioeconomic and demographic factors. The data are from the 2000 Mexican Census 10 percent sample. Among indigenous people, Presbyterians have lower rates of child mortality than Catholics. However, no significant differentials are found in child mortality by religious affiliation among nonindigenous people. The indigenous health ministry of the Presbyterian Church and the social and cultural transformations that tend to accompany religious conversion may have an impact on child survival among disadvantaged populations such as the indigenous people in Chiapas.	3	Eunice D.

Brown, R.. 2009. 'Denominational Differences in Support for Race-based Policies Among White, Black, Hispanic, and Asian Americans.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 48:3 604-615.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	5	This study builds upon past studies of denominational culture and racial attitudes by positioning evangelicals as the basis of comparison when assessing denominational differences in American racial attitudes. The study also attempts to extend the theoretical contribution of religious culture and racial attitudes by assessing support for race-based policies among black, white, Hispanic, and Asian-American evangelical and nonevangelical Protestants. In short, arguments about a distinctive individualistic religious culture among evangelicals may be useful in explaining why white evangelicals maintain lower levels of support for policies aimed at reducing racial inequality than do mainline and secular whites. However, it is of less relevance in explaining the race-based policy attitudes of white evangelicals relative to white Catholics and among nonwhites as a whole.	1	R. Khari Brown

Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:3 245-260.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	23	Although fundamental cause theory has been highly influential in shaping the research literature on health disparities, there have been few empirical demonstrations of the theory, particularly in dynamic perspective. In this study, we examine how income disparities in cholesterol levels have changed with the emergence of statins, an expensive and potent new drug technology. Using nationally representative data from 1976 to 2004, we find that income gradients for cholesterol were initially positive, but then reversed and became negative in the era of statin use. While the advantaged were previously more likely to have high levels of cholesterol, they are now less likely. We consider our case study against a broader theoretical framework outlining the relationship between technology innovation and health disparities. We find that the influence of technologies on socioeconomic disparities is subject to two important modifiers: (1) the nature of the technological change and (2) the extent of its diffusion and adoption.	2	Virginia W.

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	6	Granovetter theory on the strength of weak ties motivates hypotheses on the diffusive nature of suicidal thoughts in the friendship networks of adolescents. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, the effects of friends-of-friends attempting suicide on the suicidal thoughts of respondents are estimated. A focus on friends-of-friends permits a test of the weakties thesis because respondents are indirectly linked to friends-of-friends by ``open ties'' that are both structurally weak and used as bridges. Results for ``at-risk'' respondents-or those with certain behaviors, statuses, and experiences that create psychological predispositions to suicide-are consistent with Granovetter theory and thus reveal the ``dark side'' of the strength of weak ties as at-risk respondents are more likely to seriously think about committing suicide when a friend-of-a-friend attempts suicide, controlling for past suicidal thoughts by the respondent and attempts by friends, family, and students in the respondent school, among other control factors. Barriers to diffusion are also considered.	2	Robert D. Baller; Kelly K. Richardson

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	8	Grounded conceptually in social cognitive theory, this research examines how personal, behavioral, and environmental factors are associated with risk perceptions of anabolic-androgenic steroids. Ordinal logistic regression and logit log-linear models applied to data gathered from high-school seniors (N = 2,160) in the 2005 Monitoring the Future study showed significant explanatory effects for sex, race, exposure to drug spots, steroid availability, peer use of steroids, sensation-seeking, depression, and self-esteem. Females, African Americans, and those who had seen drug spots the most frequently estimated higher levels of risk associated with steroid use, while those who indicated ease in obtaining steroids and those with close friends who had used the drugs estimated lower risk. Also estimating lower levels of risk were sensation seekers, those who appeared depressed, and those with low levels of self-esteem. Analyses reveal how steroid risk determinants may differ from those related to methylenedioxymethamphetamine (i.e., MDMA, ecstasy) and marijuana use.	1	Bryan E. Denham

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	5	Individual and household-level characteristics that influence sexual behavior have been extensively studied in South Africa, but community characteristics have received limited attention. We use multilevel discrete time hazard models and multilevel logistic regression models to analyze data from a representative sample of young people in KwaZulu Natal, and from several sources of community data. Results suggest that, net of individual and household characteristics, higher levels of community concentrated disadvantage are associated with increased hazard of sexual initiation and higher risk of unprotected sex. Social disorder increases the hazard of sexual initiation, while greater community social cohesion is associated with delayed sexual debut, although the latter association appears stronger for young men than for young women. We discuss these results and the ways they vary from predictions based on US. theory in light of conditions prevailing in contemporary South Africa.	2	Sarah A. Burgard; Susan M. Lee-Rife

Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:3 310-326.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	16	The high levels of depression among teenage mothers have received considerable research attention in smaller targeted samples, but a large-scale examination of the complex relationship between adolescent childbearing and psychological distress that explores bidirectional causality is needed. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) and the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort, we found that teenage mothers had higher levels of distress than their childless adolescent peers and adult mothers, but the experience of teenage childbearing did not appear to be the cause. Rather teenage mothers' distress levels were already higher than their peers before they became pregnant, and they remained higher after childbearing and into early and middle adulthood We also found that distress did not increase the likelihood of adolescent childbearing except among poor teenagers. In this group, experiencing high levels of distress markedly increased the probability of becoming a teenage mother Among nonpoor teenage girls, the relationship between distress and subsequent teenage childbearing was spurious.	2	Stefanie Mollborn; Elizabeth Morningstar

Widowhood effects on weight loss are a particular concern for population health trends, especially among African Americans.	3	Debra Umberson; Hui Liu; Daniel Powers

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	42	This article develops a series of hypotheses about the long-term effects of one history of marriage, divorce, and widowhood on health, and it tests those hypotheses using data from the Health and Retirement Study. We examine four dimensions of health at mid-life: chronic conditions, mobility limitations, self-rated health, and depressive symptoms. We find that the experience of marital disruption damages health, with the effects still evident years later; among the currently married, those who have ever been divorced show worse health on all dimensions. Both the divorced and widowed who do not remarry show worse health than the currently married on all dimensions. Dimensions of health that seem to develop slowly, such as chronic conditions and mobility limitations, show strong effects of past marital disruption, whereas others, such as depressive symptoms, seem more sensitive to current marital status. Those who spent more years divorced or widowed show more chronic conditions and mobility limitations.	2	Mary Elizabeth Hughes; Linda J. Waite
Carr, Deborah. 2009. 'Who's to Blame? Perceived Responsibility for Spousal Death and Psychological Distress Among Older Widowed Persons.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:3 359-375.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	5	I examine the ways that bereaved older adults attribute responsibility for their late spouses' deaths, and the consequences of such attributions for psychological adjustment to loss. Data are from the Changing Lives of Older Couples, a prospective study of married persons ages 65 and older. Bereaved persons whose late spouse smoked and had a sedentary lifestyle attributed higher levels of blame to the decedent. Persons who believe that their late spouse stressful lifestyle and poor health care compliance contributed to the death report significantly lower levels of yearning, yet these effects are no longer statistically significant when marital quality is controlled. Bereaved spouses who believe health care providers contributed to the death report significantly more anger symptoms. The findings suggest that older adults adhere to a ``secular morality ``; deceased spouses who previously maintained unhealthy lifestyles are viewed as partly responsible for their own deaths.	1	Deborah Carr
Moore, Ryan & Michael Roberts. 2009. 'Do-it-yourself Mobilization: Punk and Social Movements.' Mobilization. 14:3 273-291.	Mobilization	2009	3	The intersection between music and social movements is a fertile area of research. We present three case studies taken from punk the Rock Against Racism campaign in Britain during the late 1970s, the American hardcore scene of the 1980s, and the riot grrrl feminism of the early 1990s-as instances where music and subculture have not simply figured as symbolic forms of resistance and identity formation but also as a means of organizing protest, raising consciousness, and creating change. The central mechanism that has allowed punk subcultures to achieve high levels of mobilization has been the do-it-yourself ethic, which demands that punks take matters of cultural production into their own hands by making music, fanzines, and record labels, creating a network of venues for live music performance, as well as creating other forms of micromedia that are commercially independent of the corporate culture industry. We use these case studies to both draw attention to neglected areas of empirical research and as a means to intervene in theoretical debates that have tended to polarize social movement studies between paradigms that emphasize structural phenomena and those that emphasize cultural factors.	2	Ryan Moore; Michael Roberts

Mobilization	2009	6	This article builds a theoretical framework that highlights the role of social movements in industry emergence and growth. Using insights from the literature on social movement outcomes and industry creation, the article shows that the environmental movement has shaped the development of the wind energy industry at both the national and subnational levels. During the past two decades, wind power has transformed from a small, ``alternative'' energy industry into a multibillion-dollar global industry that produces electricity for millions of people. Quantitative analysis shows that the wind energy industry grows the fastest in countries and regions that have not only a high density of environmental groups but also good wind potential or a favorable political opportunity structure. Case studies deepen this picture by examining how environmental organizations contribute to the development of the wind energy industry.	1	Ion Bogdan Vasi
Broer, Christian & Jan Duyvendak. 2009. 'Discursive Opportunities, Feeling Rules, and the Rise of Protests Against Aircraft Noise.' Mobilization. 14:3 337-356.	Mobilization	2009	5	Social movement researchers propose different ways to incorporate meaning into structural approaches, notably into political opportunity structure (POS) theory. In this article we further develop one of the recent attempts to do so: discursive opportunity structure theory (DOS) as proposed by Koopmans and Olzak. We pay particular attention to the role of feelings. Although the DOS model correctly points toward the discursive construction of political opportunities, it does not explain why certain events are experienced as opportunities by potential activists. We propose the reason is two-fold: 1) discourse contains feeling rules and 2) discourse resonance implies the shaping of protest subjectivity. Our model is applied to a specific case: protests against aircraft noise annoyance in two countries. We show that feeling annoyed by aircraft sound is shaped by specific policy discourses, which then prepares the ground for protests.	2	Christian Broer; Jan Willem Duyvendak

Mobilization. 14:3 357-374.	Mobilization	2009	1	This article takes issue with the ``weak state'' and ``hollowing out of the state'' theses, which appear in recent literatures dealing with globalization. In order to analyze the nation state's. contention with various actors concerning human rights and other issues, a conceptual distinction is suggested between state autonomy and capacity-defined as the state's ability to rationally posit objectives and to realize them-and state sovereignty, defined as the symbolic and discursive basis of the state's legitimate rule. Based on the constructivist perspective, which emphasizes the intersubjective character of the social world, and the role of knowledge and interpretation in any social conflict, we present three cases of objections to Israel's construction of a separation barrier on occupied Palestinian territories. These three cases exemplify the importance of the conceptual distinction between autonomy-capacity and sovereignty as two dimensions of domination and reveal a situation in which political struggles that effectively reduce state autonomy may actually increase its sovereignty.	2	Uri Ben-Eliezer; Yuval Feinstein

Mobilization	2009	1	This study asks under what domestic conditions environmental groups in the United Kingdom, France, and Germany will overcome the collective action, resource, and ideological impediments to cooperative activity. A political opportunity structure (POS) approach is employed which looks at the relationship between elite alliances and domestic cleavages and the choice to engage in domestic as well as transnational cooperation. Using data gathered through content analysis over a nearly twenty-five year period, I find that changes in domestic opportunities influence the choice of environmental groups to engage in cooperative activities. An open POS is found to depress both domestic and transnational cooperation, while a closed POS increases cooperative activities.	1	Lori Poloni-Staudinger
Gowan, Teresa. 2009. 'New Hobos or Neo-romantic Fantasy? Urban Ethnography Beyond the Neoliberal Disconnect.' Qualitative Sociology. 32:3 231-257.	Qualitative Sociology	2009	2	This article describes an anomalous social space within the field of homelessness in San Francisco, that of ``pro'' recyclers, homeless men who spend much of their time collecting recyclables for redemption. Unlike the panhandlers, broken shelter-dwellers and small-time hustlers of San Francisco's Tenderloin and other skid row zones, the recyclers orient much of their existence around work. By working within a unique economic niche provided by the state-supported recycling industry, and by drawing on support from sympathetic residents and advocates, the recyclers create an unusual homeless subculture which, as they themselves argue, has more than a little in common with the hobo jungles of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. To interrogate the sociological (and political) implications of this case study I use Lo < c Wacquant's eloquent manifesto against sociological ``neo-romanticism.'' While agreeing with some of Wacquant's analysis, I argue that his emphasis on the moralism of contemporary urban ethnographers blinds him to the very real concerns with morality and ethics among poor people themselves. The recyclers' concerns with mutual respect and the pleasures of labor represent, I believe, not post hoc justifications of desperate survival strategies, but a dogged, often passionate collective effort to create a truly different experience and understanding of homelessness itself.	1	Teresa Gowan

Qualitative Sociology	2009	1	This article examines how former prisoners of color conceptualize their political, social, and economic futures and how these conceptualizations relate to the racialized social structural obstacles encountered upon reentry and decisions to re-engage criminal labor. I find that, presented with similar post-prison challenges, excarcerated men take several approaches when reentering society. I argue that the differences among their approaches lie in their varying interpretations of how they can act as individuals against and within their social structural limitations. Their decisions to rejoin or forfeit participation in criminal economies are thus shaped by experiences confronting the limitations of material conditions but also emerge from their critiques of racialized structures.	1	Lucia Trimbur

This article reveals how nannies use public spaces in the neighborhoods in which they work to establish ties similar to co-worker relations in other settings. This paper demonstrates how nannies create a community at the park by incorporating park staff into their activities, reinforcing group values such as sharing and reciprocity, and distinguishing themselves from their employers. Adding to previous research which highlights the atomization and stigmatization that comes with domestic employment, this article shows how nannies create co-worker relationships that are buffers against unfavorable job conditions such as solitary work settings and unappreciative employers.	1	Amada Armenta
Stein, Arlene. 2009. 'Trauma and Origins: Post-holocaust Genealogists and the Work of Memory.' Qualitative Sociology. 32:3 293-309.	Qualitative Sociology	2009	2	In the 1970s, as children of Holocaust survivors reached adulthood, many began to excavate, piece together, and re-fashion their fractured family histories. This movement achieved momentum in the 1980s and 1990s, as the so-called ``second generation'' moved into middle age. Drawing from data gleaned from participant observation on a listserv for children of survivors and from interviews, I argue that those who engage in post-Holocaust genealogy are searching for coherent narratives that place their own origin in the context of the families into which they were born. By seeking, borrowing from and selectively appropriating traces of the past, they are using them as raw material in the production of new stories about the past and, by implication, the present.	1	Arlene Stein
Levey, Hilary. 2009. '``which One Is Yours?'': Children and Ethnography.' Qualitative Sociology. 32:3 311-331.	Qualitative Sociology	2009	6	This paper explores roles that children play in ethnographic research. Based on the limited literature on children in the field, and drawing on examples from ethnographies across disciplines, I identify four roles for children: 1) as ``wedges,'' or as instrumentally important in helping adult ethnographers gain access in various ways; 2) as collaborators; 3) as objects of study; and 4) as subjects of study. I also discuss the ways in which these roles illuminate key methodological issues in ethnography, like reflexivity, ethics, and agency. The paper synthesizes and integrates previously disconnected research on the presence of children in the field with ethnographies in which children and childhood are the topics of research. I draw on my own fieldwork experiences for further illustration.	1	Hilary Levey

Review of Religious Research	2009	2	The purpose of the current study is to examine the relationship between religion and post death contact among older Mexican Americans. Four major themes emerged from 52 in-depth interviews that were conducted with older Mexican Americans residing in Texas. First, many older study participants told us they had contact with the dead, but others indicated this was not possible. Second, the form in which contact with the dead was made varied greatly. Some older Mexican Americans reported they had visual contact with the dead while others said they only made contact with the dead through dreams. Third, although some older Mexican American study participants believed that it was in the best interests of the dead to contact the living, others felt the dead should instead be in Heaven with God. Fourth, the participants in our study reported that having contact with the dead provides a number of important social and psychological benefits. In the process of discussing these themes, an emphasis is placed on how beliefs and experiences with the dead interface with religion. In addition, we also explore how post death contact may be associated with health and well-being in late life.	2	Neal Krause; Elena Bastida

Findings also highlight the need for high response rates and representative sampling methodologies to provide a valid view of congregationally-based youth programming.	4	Patricia Snell; Christian Smith; Carlos Tavares; Kari Christoffersen
Baker, Joseph. 2009. 'the Variety of Religious Experiences.' Review of Religious Research. 51:1 39-54.	Review of Religious Research	2009	2	The primary effort of this study is to help move sociological studies of religious experience out of the realm of abstract theory and into quantitative analysis. While this is certainly not the first study to do this, the breadth of experiences assessed by the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey provides more detailed information on the topic than has previously been presented. Results indicate that over 65\% of American adults claim to have had at least one of the religious experiences assessed. The different socio-demographic patterning found among specific experiences indicates that using a broad, all-encompassing question to analyze religious experiences is inadequate. A theoretical distinction is also proposed between experiences involving only feelings and those extending to other sensory sensations such as seeing, speaking, hearing, or healing. While income level does not influence claiming more normative religious experiences of feeling, it is an important predictor of more intense, deviant religious experiences.	1	Joseph O. Baker

Review of Religious Research	2009	0	This article examines the effectiveness of Catholic Citizenship, a lay organization founded in Massachusetts and dedicated to mobilizing Catholic voters on issues of importance to the Church hierarchy. The paper relies upon interviews with Catholic Citizenship's leaders and other political actors, assessments of voter guides and additional sources, media attention, election outcomes, and the capacity to gather signatures for a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. Catholic Citizenship utilizes a parish-based model and methods familiar to scholars of conservative religious political movements. The organization's effectiveness has varied with the type of activity undertaken, and its future prospects appear modest.	1	Maurice T. Cunningham

Review of Religious Research	2009	3	Substantial research has documented the association between religion and socioeconomic attainment in Western nations. As Christianity has expanded and been transformed in developing nations and the confrontation between Islam and the West has received growing attention, the role religion plays in socioeconomic inequality continues to be a critical issue. We use the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey for 2003 to test the relationship between religious affiliation and socioeconomic attainment. Religious differences in socioeconomic outcomes are substantial in Ghana. Mainline Protestants have a significant advantage in education and wealth. Catholics and other Christians have intermediate values on these socioeconomic outcomes. Muslims and those without attachment to formal religious groups have a significant disadvantage. Educational differences are particularly important because they account for some of the differences in wealth.

Review of Religious Research	2009	3	As prisons across the United States increasingly utilize faith-based programs under the auspices of correctional treatment, investigators have studied how these programs impact the attitudes and behaviors of inmates while in prison and after release. Little is known, however about the ministry workers responsible for the provision of these faith-based prison programs. We address this understudied issue using the rich narratives of thirty prison chaplains and local religious congregants in Mississippi. Two overarching themes emerged from their narratives of prison ministry work. First, chaplains and local congregants have a distinctive goal orientation that discourages the creation of numeric goals for their ministry. Second, the ministry workers are careful to avoid specific denominational issues that might create barriers to inmates' religious involvement or that might create security issues. This study provides an in-depth understanding of the motivations and approaches used by this understudied group	3	Kent R. Kerley; Todd L. Matrhews; Jessica Shoemaker
Kennedy, Emily, Thomas Beckley, Bonita McFarlane & Solange Nadeau. 2009. 'Rural-urban Differences in Environmental Concern in Canada.' Rural Sociology. 74:3 309-329.	Rural Sociology	2009	1	Distinctions between rural and urban populations are well documented in environmental sociology literature. Rural and urban places may exert different influences on participation in environmentally supportive behavior (ESB) as well as on other forms of environmental concern (EC). The influence of these distinct geographies may be due to present circumstances or because of childhood socialization in these places. Using data from a national survey in Canada (n = 1,664), we use cognitive (basic values, environmental worldview, and environmental attitude) and behavioral indicators (Public and private sphere) of EC to explore differences among rural and urban populations and we include analyses accounting for place of socialization. We extend the conventional private sphere category of ESB by including stewardship behaviors. Results showed few differences between rural and urban residents on indicators of EC. Rural residents, however, scored higher on altruistic values, placed a higher priority oil the environment, and reported higher participation in recycling and stewardship behaviors. Analysis that included place of socialization showed differences on environmental world-view, basic values, and some ESB. In terms of ESB, we conclude that residence and place of socialization may be less of a factor than opportunity and highlight the importance of providing services and facilities. We recommend future research on residence and ESB include a variety of behaviors that reflect Opportunities for both rural and urban residents.	4	Emily Huddart Kennedy; Thomas M. Beckley; Bonita L.

Edwards, Mark, Melissa Torgerson & Jennifer Sattem. 2009. 'Paradoxes of Providing Rural Social Services: the Case of Homeless Youth.' Rural Sociology. 74:3 330-355.	Rural Sociology	2009	0	Economic and demographic changes in rural areas continue to introduce big-city problems in small towns. These communities' ability and willingness to respond are likely to be influenced by the geography, culture, and array of organizations in rural places. But how these characteristics of rural places shape local response is hard to predict and as yet unexplored. This article reports data from interviews with social-service providers and homeless youth in a rural county in the northwestern United States, drawing insights from both groups about the challenges of providing social services in rural places. Findings about drug use, sexual abuse and prostitution in rural Communities illustrate how aspects of a rural context can influence the way small towns address social problems.	3	Mark Evan Edwards; Melissa Torgerson; Jennifer Sattem
Robbins, Paul, Katharine Meehan, Hannah Gosnell & Susan Gilbertz. 2009. 'Writing the New West: a Critical Review.' Rural Sociology. 74:3 356-382.	Rural Sociology	2009	16	A vast and growing interdisciplinary research effort has focused on the rise of the so-called New West, purportedly the product of regional socioeconomic, political, and ecological upheavals in states like Montana and Colorado. Reviewing the growing research on this problem in sociology, economics, geography, and conservation science, this article identifies four central questions at the core of this diverse scholarship. Our review demonstrates that none of these central questions has generated consensus conclusions and that there is untapped potential for more structurally robust analyses of the drivers and outcomes of rapid change in the region. Indeed, supporting other analyses that have called the consistency of the region into question, our survey suggests the ways in which this region is not unique, but largely reflective of larger scale socioecological forces playing out in similar ways around the postindustrial world. We conclude, therefore, with a series of crucial questions, which may be unanswerable by assuming the ``New West'' as a coherent geography.	4	Paul Robbins; Katharine Meehan; Hannah Gosnell; Susan J.

Smit, Arnoud, Peter Driessen & Pieter Glasbergen. 2009. 'Conversion to Organic Dairy Production in the Netherlands: Opportunities and Constraints.' Rural Sociology. 74:3 383-411.	Rural Sociology	2009	3	Organic agriculture is perceived as being more sustainable than conventional agriculture. However, while there is a growing interest in, and market for, organic products, large-scale conversion to organic agriculture is not taking place. Even though conversion from conventional to organic dairy production is not especially difficult in theory, conversion is slow in this specific sector. The conversion process to organic agriculture is often analyzed by investigating farmer motivations and attitudes. However, since modern agricultural production is organized in production chains, which are in turn subject to stakeholder influence, a wider focus that includes these interrelation ships might provide new insights regarding the lagging conversion. Based on document analysis, policy analysis, and interviews, this article investigates opportunities for, and barriers to, conversion to organic dairy production in the Netherlands within the setting of the chain network. Opportunities and barriers are found at three levels within the chain network: the actor level, the chain level, and the network level. We conclude that, despite some involvement in organic production and a positive disposition toward it, the chain network is not ready for a large-scale conversion.	3	Arnoud A. Smit; Peter P.

Clement, Matthew. 2009. 'a Basic Accounting of Variation in Municipal Solid-waste Generation at the County Level in Texas, 2006: Groundwork for Applying Metabolic-rift Theory to Waste Generation.' Rural Sociology. 74:3 412-429.	Rural Sociology	2009	3	Environmental social scientists debate whether or not. modern development reduces society's impact on the biosphere. The empirical research informing the discussion has not yet adequately examined the social determinants of municipal solid-waste (MSW) generation, an increasingly relevant issue, both ecologically and sociologically. A primary problem for this research concerns the increasing exchange of MSW across state and county borders. A convenient way to avoid this problem is to examine variation between counties with landfills that service only the county in which the landfills are located. I applied this restriction to a cross-sectional analysis of total MSW generated in Texas at the county level for 2006. Using robust regression, this Study found that two basic measures of modern development, Population per square mile and per capita income, are both positively related to total MSW generated at the county level and together explain about 73 percent of the variation in the dependent variable. The evidence corroborates the metabolic-rift theory. The concentration of people onto smaller land areas, or urbanization, and increasing wealth in a capitalist economy contribute to the metabolic rupture between human society and the environment.	1	Matthew Thomas Clement
Fairweather, John, Chris Rosin, Lesley Hunt & Hugh Campbell. 2009. 'Are Conventional Farmers Conventional? Analysis of the Environmental Orientations of Conventional New Zealand Farmers.' Rural Sociology. 74:3 430-454.	Rural Sociology	2009	9	Within the political economy of agriculture and agrofood literatures there are examples of approaches that reject simple dichotomies between alternatives and the mainstream. In line with such approaches, we challenge the assumption that alternative agriculture, and its attendant improved environmental practices, alternative management styles, less intensive approaches, and better approaches to animal and ecosystem welfare, is the only source of agricultural sustainability. This article uses national farm-survey results for New Zealand's sheep and beef, dairy, and horticulture sectors to examine conventional farmers, measure their assessments of farming practices, and assess their environmental orientation. Analysis identifies a proenvironmental cluster of farmers in each sector characterized by a higher environmental-orientation score and distinct ratings of other farm practices queried in the Survey. We interpret the results in terms of the exposure of different agricultural sectors to the effects of market-based, audited, best-practice schemes. The presence of shades of ``greenness'' among conventional farmers has important implications for environmental management and for our understanding of the various and complex pathways toward the greening of agrofood systems.	4	John R.

Szonyi, Michael. 2009. 'Secularization Theories and the Study of Chinese Religions.' Social Compass. 56:3 312-327.	Social Compass	2009	0	The author proposes a dialogue between recent literature on the history of Chinese popular religion and recent sociological debates about secularization theory, asking whether a better understanding of concepts, theories and evidence from one field may be productive in interpreting those of the other. The author suggests on the one hand that certain elements of secularization theory can be useful tools in understanding the modern history of religions in China and on the other that thinking about what secularization has meant in China is crucial to a comparative global history of religion and modernity. He also argues that attention to secularization both as a historical process and as a political ideology may help us to better understand the religious policies of the People's Republic of China today.	1	Michael Szonyi

Social Compass	2009	0	The author explores the reasons why scholars have overlooked the importance of judicial rituals in Chinese legal culture and considers this neglect in the light of scholarship on secularization. He explores the issue by analysing the interaction between Chinese and western judicial practices in the colonial histories of the Straits Settlements (now Malaysia and Singapore) and Hong Kong. The concept of secularization appears to be of relevance to the study of Chinese legal culture, given that secularized societies tend to become differentiated into autonomous sub-systems, religion being restricted in influence to its own sub-system. In fact, however, religion has continuously interacted with a range of other sub-systems in China, including legal ones, which indicates that, in modern Chinese legal culture, religion and the law have not evolved into separate sub-systems.	1	Paul R.

Laliberte, Andre. 2009. 'Between Desecularization and Resacralization: Buddhist Laity, Temples and Philantropic Organizations in China.' Social Compass. 56:3 345-361.	Social Compass	2009	1	The author looks into the revival of Buddhist philanthropy in the People's Republic of China (PRC) in the last decade. It seeks to tackle the wider question of the social utility of religion in the eyes of the political authorities and to assess the extent to which recent debates on secularization theory may be relevant to the Chinese situation. The emergence of Buddhist philanthropy is coinciding with considerable changes in political, economic and social conditions, characterized by state disengagement from the provision of social services. The author describes various organizations offering assistance to the poor, as well as certain services related to healthcare and education. Yet this rise in Buddhist philanthropy should not be seen as evidence of a ``resacralization'' process in China because the communist Party-State continues its policy of manifest secularization.	1	Andre Laliberte
Dobbelaere, Karel. 2009. 'China Challenges Secularization Theory.' Social Compass. 56:3 362-370.	Social Compass	2009	0	The author proposes a reflection on challenges that the three anthropological articles in this issue present for secularization theory. The first two discuss ``performances'' of religion in two different Chinese cultural periods: welfare services offered by recognized religious associations in the People's Republic of China and the judicial rituals in colonial settings. The author suggests similarities with such ``performances'' in western culture. The second part of the article discusses some issues raised by Szonyi in his comparison of recent social research literature on Chinese religion and sociological literature on secularization: a critique of the concept of ``modernity'' in relation to secularization; a reflection on the possibility of establishing a secularization theory with universal validity; how to integrate rational choice theory and secularization theory; the validity of secularization in view of individual religious sensitivity; and secularization as an ideology and a discussion of the so-called ``privatization of religion'' in secularized settings.	1	Karel Dobbelaere
Luchau, Peter. 2009. 'Toward a Contextualized Concept of Civil Religion.' Social Compass. 56:3 371-386.	Social Compass	2009	1	A new definition of civil religion is needed because there are almost as many definitions as there are writers on the subject. By combining two existing concepts it can be shown that most existing definitions of civil religion are related. The two concepts are religious pluralism versus monoculture and public versus private religion. The first takes into consideration that civil religion will look different in a mono-religious country than in a multi-religious country. The second makes a distinction between civil religion at a rhetorical level (e. g. speeches) and at a personal level (individual religiosity). Although there are many different definitions of civil religion, the differences can be reconciled if the religious situation and the analytical level are taken into consideration. Hopefully this will make future discussions and analyses of civil religion more comparable.	1	Peter Luchau
Fancello, Sandra. 2009. 'Migration and Multilinguism: Speaking in Tongues in the African Churches in Europe.' Social Compass. 56:3 387-404.	Social Compass	2009	0	Linguistic practices in the African Churches in Europe are closely linked to the type of migration that has taken place. The choice of liturgical languages is in line with strategies of ``community rebuilding'' by migrants in an urban environment or with strategies of conversion by Europeans. A study of the importance of life stories and conversion paths leads to an understanding of the modes of social interaction that lead these migrants to choose either French or English, a situation which can cause conflict with their mother tongue. In a multilingual context, ``speaking in tongues'' may appear as a fictitious solution to the contradictions of unity in diversity.	1	Sandra Fancello

Social Compass	2009	0	Christian weight loss programs in the United States are significant sites of evangelical negotiation between cultural distinction and cultural participation. First Place, a Christian weight loss program sponsored in churches across the country, both appropriates dominant American concerns about health and fears of obesity, and reinscribes them in a cultural context that gives religious meaning to this seemingly worldly pursuit. The author, basing herself on qualitative research, examines three critical areas in which First Place distinguishes itself from its secular counterparts and renders weight loss a spiritually significant task: motivation for weight loss, the problem of physical appearance, and the question of sin. The author argues that First Place is an example of both evangelical submission to and cultivation of cultural capital and symbolic power.	1	Lynne Gerber

In this study, we examine a key mechanism in this intergenerational process: mothers' selection of early child care. Analyses of the NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development revealed that maternal education was positively associated. with configurations of child-care characteristics (i.e., type, quality, quantity) most closely linked to children's school readiness. This association was not solely a function of mother's income or employment status, persisted despite controls for many observable confounds (e.g., maternal cognitive and psychological skills, paternal characteristics), and, according to post-hoc indices, was fairly robust in terms of unobservable confounds.	3	Jennifer March Augustine; Shannon E.

This study examines the topic by analyzing National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health data, modeling gender and racial/ethnic differences in early life depression trajectories and investigating the influences of stress and socioeconomic status. Results indicate females and minorities experience elevated depressive symptoms across early life compared to males and whites. SES and stressful life events explain much of the racial/ethnic disparities. Blacks, Hispanics and females show greater sensitivity to the effects of low SES, and in the case of females, SLEs. Overall, this study develops a nuanced, dynamic model of the multiplicative effects of social disadvantage on early life depression disparities.	5	Daniel E. Adkins; Victor Wang; Matthew E.

Cheng, Simon & Kathryn Lively. 2009. 'Multiracial Self-identification and Adolescent Outcomes: a Social Psychological Approach to the Marginal Man Theory.' Social Forces. 88:1 61-98.	Social Forces	2009	5	Recent public health research has consistently reported that self-identified multiracial adolescents tend to display more problem behaviors and psychological difficulties than monoracial adolescents. Relying on insights from qualitative analyses using small or clinical samples to interpret these empirical patterns, these studies implicitly assume a pejorative stance toward adolescents' multiracial self-identification. Building on the social psychological arguments underlying Park's and Stonequist's seminal discussions of the ``marginal man,'' we derive hypotheses indicating that self-identified multiracial adolescents may show more psychological difficulties, but are also likely to have more active social interaction and participation than monoracial groups. We also incorporate later elaborations of the marginal man theory to develop alternative hypotheses regarding multiracial youth's school and behavioral outcomes. Based on a nationally representative sample of racially self-identified youth, the results suggest that patterns of multiracial-monoracial differences are generally consistent with the hypotheses derived closely from the marginal man theory or its subsequent elaborations. We examine the heterogeneities within these general patterns across different multiracial categories and discuss the implications of these findings.	2	Simon Cheng; Kathryn J. Lively

I find that young people who have a visual, hearing, speech or ``other'' impairment are more likely than their nondisabled peers to find themselves among the respondents who did not complete any of the adult transitions examined in the analysis. Young people who have a learning disability are also more likely to be in a ``just workers'' group (i.e., respondents who are still living at home, for the most part, but working fulltime).	1	Alexander L.

Social Forces	2009	4	Sociologists have long sought to understand the relationship between collective experiences and individual commitments. This article examines the short-term mission as an institutionalized religious experience, assessing its prevalence, predictors and impact on the religions trajectories of the youth who participate in them. Religiously devout adolescents are more likely than others to go on a short-term mission as are younger adolescents and those with very religious parents. Applying propensity score matching to a nationally representative longitudinal sample of American adolescents, we find that adolescents who go on a short-term mission between interview waves report increased religious participation and solidified religious beliefs. We use the example of this experience to emphasize the importance of considering religious experiences to develop more nuanced understandings of the way religion shapes the beliefs and behaviors of individuals.	2	Jenny Trinitapoli; Stephen Vaisey

Social Forces	2009	2	We examine the manner in which voluntary associations expose individuals to differing perspectives, or ``cross-talk.'' Specifically we develop hypotheses based on the interactive roles of elite bias and homophily in structuring networks of democratic participation and test them on social network data of Los Angeles neighborhood councils. We find that homophily leads to boards less diverse than their communities, but does not lead to homogeneous cliques within boards. Moreover, we find that elite bias and homophily counteract each other in lower-status communities, leading to more diverse boards than would be predicted by homophily alone. We then examine the effects of assortative mixing on political attitudes and collective action, and find weak support for the proposition that associational diversity promotes tolerance and access to information.	3	Christopher Weare; Juliet Musso; Kyu-Nahm Jun

Social Forces	2009	3	Following Tocqueville, many scholars consider associations ``schools of democracy'' because members can develop civic capacities within them. This article identifies the distribution of civic development opportunities across civic sectors (e.g., politics, service, recreation), focusing on understudied apolitical groups. New data is introduced on a set of often referenced, but rarely studied, associations: choral societies. Choruses are shown to offer numerous opportunities for interpersonal interaction, governance experience and institutional relationships. Data are compared to opportunities offered by associations in other civic sectors. Apolitical arts associations are found to provide as many or more opportunities for individual civic development than their politically and service-oriented counterparts suggesting their potential for shrinking the political communication gap between naturally politically interested and disinterested citizens.	1	Matthew Baggetta
Olzak, Susan & Sarah Soule. 2009. 'Cross-cutting Influences of Environmental Protest and Legislation.' Social Forces. 88:1 201-225.	Social Forces	2009	14	This research examines the influence of types of protest activities, Congressional hearings and political characteristics on environmental legislation enacted from 1961-1990. We find that rates of environmental protest rise with increases in the amount of previous institutional activities, but extra-institutional activities do not raise the overall rate of protest. Protest has no direct effect on the passage of legislation, but institutional protest activities significantly raise the rate of Congressional hearings on the environment. When comparing all environmental law's to those designated as having a major impact, we find both similarities and differences. For example, prior legislative activity decreases both rates, but increases in criteria air pollutants and partisan characteristics of Congress significantly affect only the rates of major environmental legislation.	2	Susan Olzak; Sarah A.

Smits, Jeroen & Hyunjoon Park. 2009. 'Five Decades of Educational Assortative Mating in 10 East Asian Societies.' Social Forces. 88:1 227-255.	Social Forces	2009	9	We study trends in educational homogamy at six boundaries in the educational structure of 10 East-Asian societies and explain its variation using explanatory variables at the country, cohort and boundary level. Educational homogamy was higher at the higher boundaries in the educational structure. Since the 1950s it decreased at all but the lowest boundaries, indicating convergence to a relatively low level of homogamy. Educational homogamy is lower in societies that are more modern, have higher female employment and experienced less Confucian influence. Results support the general openness and the exclusivity hypothesis, which predict educational homogamy to decrease in modernizing societies and to be higher when the group of more highly educated is smaller. Findings suggest that the trend towards less educational homogamy is related to educational expansion.	2	Jeroen Smits; Hyunjoon Park
Song, Lijun. 2009. 'the Effect of the Cultural Revolution on Educational Homogamy in Urban China.' Social Forces. 88:1 257-270.	Social Forces	2009	2	This article demonstrates that the Cultural Revolution led to a temporary decline in educational homogamy in urban China, which was reversed when the Cultural Revolution ended. Previous studies on educational homogamy in China have paid incomplete attention to China's shifting institutional structures. This research applies institutional theory to the trend of educational homogamy in urban China. During the Cultural Revolution (1966-76) state policies lowered educational legitimacy, educational homogeneity and mating opportunities in school in the urban marriage market while enhancing them before and after. From the institutional perspective I hypothesize that the strength of educational homogamy in urban China during the Cultural Revolution was weaker than before and after. I use log-multiplicative layer effect models to analyze data representative of urban residents in 20 cities. I find moderate but significant evidence for the institutional hypotheses. Educational assortative mating is subject to political intervention in urban China.	1	Lijun Song

Social Forces	2009	9	Our study analyzes how political context, embodied by the welfare state and Leftist political actors, shapes individual poverty. Using the Luxembourg Income Study, we conduct a multi-level analysis of working-aged adult poverty across 18 affluent Western democracies. Our index of welfare generosity has a negative effect on poverty net of individual characteristics and structural context. For each standard deviation increase in welfare generosity, the odds of poverty decline by a factor of 2.3. The odds of poverty in the United States (the least generous welfare state) are greater by a factor of 16.6 than a person with identical characteristics in Denmark (the most generous welfare state). Significant interaction effects suggest that welfare generosity reduces the extent to which low education and the number of children increase poverty. Also, welfare generosity reduces poverty among those with low education, single-mother households and young households. We show that Leftist parties and union density reduce the odds of poverty, however their effects channel through the welfare state. Ultimately, poverty is shaped both by individual characteristics and the political context in which the individual resides.	3	David Brady; Andrew S. Fullerton; Jennifer Moren Cross

Social Forces	2009	5	It is widely argued that globalization and economic development are associated with international migration. However, these relationships have not been tested empirically. We use a cross-national empirical analysis to assess the impact of global and national factors on international migration from less-developed countries. An interdisciplinary analytical framework is developed. We then use several modeling techniques to analyze panel data on a set of less-developed countries from 1970 to 2000. Three central findings emerge from these analyses. First, foreign direct investment has a significant, differential effect across sectors of the economy: FDI in the primary sector increases the level of net emigration, while FDI in the secondary sector has a deterrent effect. Second, economic development has a significant, nonlinear effect on net emigration levels, the so-called ``migration hump.'' Finally, we find a strong cumulative causation effect of migration, meaning that migration has a strong internal momentum after it has been initiated. The implications of the findings are discussed in the context of contemporary migration theory.	2	Matthew R. Sanderson; Jeffrey D. Kentor

Social Forces	2009	4	This research focuses on immigration and youthful illegalities in the Toronto area, one of the world's most ethnically diverse global cities. While current research documents a negative relationship between crime and immigration, there is little attention to individual-level mechanisms that explain the paths through which immigrant youth refrain from illegalities. Through a study of two cohorts of adolescents across two generations (1976, 1999), we elaborate a process model that is generic over both generations, and in which measures of bonds to parents and schools, commitments to education, and dispositions of risk aversity mediate youth involvement in illegalities. By focusing on a period when non-European immigration to Toronto increased dramatically, we then identify a compositional effect through which the more recent cohort is engaged in fewer illegalities.	3	Ronit Dinovitzer; John Hagan; Ron Levi
DeFina, Robert & Lance Hannon. 2009. 'Diversity, Racial Threat and Metropolitan Housing Segregation.' Social Forces. 88:1 373-394.	Social Forces	2009	5	Previous studies have shown that as the percent black or percent Hispanic grows, that group's residential segregation from whites tends to increase as well. Typically, these findings are explained in terms of white discriminatory reaction to the perceived threat associated with minority population growth. The present analysis examines whether these racial threat effects depend on the extent of racial and ethnic diversity in an area. This possibility is tested by estimating otherwise standard models of black-white and Hispanic-white segregation using metropolitan area data from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. censuses. Results from robust regression analyses strongly support the prediction for each of the white-minority pairs: the racial threat effect is significantly diminished in areas with greater multi-ethnic diversity.	2	Robert DeFina; Lance Hannon

Social Forces	2009	10	Using a sample of households nested in census tracts in 24 metropolitan areas over four time points, this study provides a robust test of the determinants of neighborhood satisfaction, taking into account the census tract context. Consistent with social disorganization theory, the presence of racial/ethnic heterogeneity and single-parent households consistently reduced neighborhood satisfaction. Those perceiving more social or physical disorder were considerably less satisfied with the neighborhood, and perceiving more crime showed an accelerating negative effect on satisfaction. Furthermore, the effect of perceiving crime was exacerbated in tracts with a distressed labor market or the presence of disengaged youth. There was consistent evidence that those with more economic investment (homeowners) or social investment (married residents and parents) in the neighborhood are more satisfied. On the other hand, longer-term residents did not report more satisfaction, nor did general residential stability in the tract increase satisfaction.	1	John R. Hipp

Are new ethnic neighborhoods forming in America's suburbs? (4. How common are ethnoburbs-that is, affluent, suburban, ethnic neighborhoods? For most racial/ethnic groups, the number and share of ethnic neighborhoods grew from 1990 to 2000 and the suburbanization trend was remarkable. Asian neighborhoods as a whole experienced the fastest growth. Ethnoburbs have formed across the country. Although ethnoburbs are more an Asian phenomenon, Hispanic and black ethnoburbs have also developed. These patterns support the segmented assimilation model and the resurgence of ethnicity perspectives.	3	Ming Wen; Diane S. Lauderdale; Namratha R. Kandula

Social Politics	2009	7	This study investigates bow European women's transnational advocacy networks (TANs) practice advocacy in regard to the gender mainstreaming strategy. Women's TANs face gender mainstreaming in several ways: They are considered to be hubs for organizing public dialogue on gender equality strategies in Europe. Moreover, employing mainstreaming tools has become a requirement for acquiring project funds from the European Union. Many TANs and their member groups thus work with mainstreaming. Finally, women's TANs are well positioned to observe and compare the implementation of mainstreaming through interaction with their national and regional members. The article builds on a series of interviews as well as on web-based data analysis to assess positions and advocacy of five European women's TANs in regard to gender mainstreaming. The findings suggest limited trust in and commitment to the strategy, but also limited advocacy. Women's TANs have developed a strategically distant position regarding gender mainstreaming. Lack of internal capacity, overall resource poverty, as well as prioritizing institutional advocacy, this study suggests, might contribute to weak politicization in regard to the gender mainstreaming strategy.	1	Sabine Lang
Marshall, Gul. 2009. 'Authenticating Gender Policies Through Sustained-pressure: the Strategy Behind the Success of Turkish Feminists.' Social Politics. 16:3 358-378.	Social Politics	2009	1	The model of ``boomerang effect'' only partially explains the dynamics of the international and national activism of Turkish feminists. When their demands were not met by the state, feminists reached out to the United Nations and the European Union. However, rather than bypassing the Turkish state as it would be expected by the boomerang model, they kept pressuring the state. This political strategy, which I call sustained-pressure, helped feminists claim responsibility and success during and after the gender policy changes of the 2000s in Turkey. Establishing the indigenousness of the need for change eased ultra-nationalist opposition to external pressure.	1	Gul Aldikacti Marshall
Garforth, Lisa & Anne Kerr. 2009. 'Women and Science: What's the Problem?.' Social Politics. 16:3 379-403.	Social Politics	2009	2	In recent years the issue of gender and SET (science, engineering, and technology) careers has become prominent in policies and debates in the UK. This paper explores the ways in which equalities solutions pertaining to women and science are locked into a narrow stock of taken-for-granted assumptions about the nature of the problem. Drawing on Foucauldian models of the productive nature of discourse, we examine the proliferation of reports and initiatives which frame the issue and critically discuss their institutional consequences including gender audits and gender experts, and the ways in which raising the profile of women in science also involves reinscribing feminine difference.	2	Lisa Garforth; Anne Kerr
Bonacich, Phillip & Elisa Bienenstock. 2009. 'Structural Implications of Reciprocal Exchange: a Power-dependence Approach.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 72:3 226-240.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	2	This paper presents and tests a general model to predict emergent exchange patterns and power differences in reciprocal exchange networks when individual actors follow the norm of reciprocity. With an interesting qualification, the experimental results reported here support the power-dependence approach (Emerson 1972a, b): those who acquire the most resources are connected to others who are dependent on them for rewards. Although, as Molm has abundantly demonstrated (1999, 2000, 2001, 2007), the quality of the relationship in negotiated and reciprocal exchange networks is quite different, and the details of a general model of network exchange might well differ for negotiated and reciprocal exchange, experimental results presented here indicate that power in networks, no matter how complex, is linked to dependence regardless of whether actors are motivated by rational choice or a norm of reciprocity	2	Phillip Bonacich; Elisa Jayne Bienenstock
Martin, John. 2009. 'Formation and Stabilization of Vertical Hierarchies Among Adolescents: Towards a Quantitative Ethology of Dominance Among Humans.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 72:3 241-264.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	7	Social psychological investigations of hierarchy formation have been almost entirely confined to the case of task-oriented groups and hence have produced theories that turn on the existence of such a task. But other forms of vertical hierarchy may emerge in non-task groups. One form, orderings of dominance, has been studied among animals using systematic behavioral observations, but almost never among humans, despite many discussions of such structures existing among adolescent males. Using stochastic models, this paper examines change in vertical orderings for data on dominance encounters among same-sex adolescent campers. There seem to be different paths for stabilization of vertical hierarchies for boys and girls, both of which involve the emergence of special roles, the top boy or the bottom girl. Further stabilization seems to be greatly facilitated (at least for boys) by members adopting Roger Gould's theory of dominance encounters and turning their attention to those close in rank.	1	John Levi Martin
Pagis, Michal. 2009. 'Embodied Self-reflexivity.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 72:3 265-283.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	6	Drawing on G. H. Mead and Merleau-Ponty, this paper aims to extend our understanding of self-reflexivity beyond the notion of a discursive, abstract, and symbolic process. It offers a framework for embodied self-reflexivity, which anchors the self in the reflexive capacity of bodily sensations. The data consist of two years of ethnographic observations and in-depth interviews of vipassana meditation practitioners in Israel and the United States. The findings illustrate how bodily sensations are used as indexes to psychological states, emotions, and past experiences, while constant awareness of embodied responses is used as a tool for self-monitoring, The paper follows the interaction between discursive and embodied modes of reflexivity and the attempt to shift from one mode to the other I suggest that currently popular practices of embodied awareness, from meditation to yoga, are based on embodied self-reflexivity and are part of the postindustrial culture of self-awareness.	1	Michal Pagis
Wallander, Lisa. 2009. '25 Years of Factorial Surveys in Sociology: a Review.' Social Science Research. 38:3 505-520.	Social Science Research	2009	26	The aim of the factorial survey approach is to uncover the social and individual structures of human judgements of social objects. By having respondents evaluate samples of vignettes (fictive descriptions), in which several factors describing the object of interest are simultaneously manipulated, this approach has a number of advantages over traditional social survey research. The aim of the present article is to provide an easy-to-follow overview of the various ways in which the approach has been applied within sociology between 1982 and 2006. The review, which is based on 106 articles published in central sociology journals, is organised into three different sections: ``factorial survey applications'', ``factorial survey designs'' and ``factorial survey analyses''.	1	Lisa Wallander

Social Science Research	2009	5	This paper employs a field experiment to assess whether interpersonal contact changes domiciled individuals' attitudes of the homeless. Volunteers for Project Homeless Connect-a one-day event that provides social services to the homeless-were asked to complete a pre- and post-survey. The results provide mixed support for the contact hypothesis. After volunteering, respondents were far less likely to see homelessness as the result of individual characteristics, such as substance abuse or work aversion. However, opinion was remarkably stable when it came to policy preferences. The results cast doubt on the conventional wisdom that individuals' perceptions of the causes of homelessness track closely with their preferences for governmental policy.	2	Tom Knecht; Lisa M.

Shauman, Kimberlee. 2009. 'Are There Sex Differences in the Utilization of Educational Capital Among College-educated Workers?.' Social Science Research. 38:3 535-571.	Social Science Research	2009	1	This paper introduces the concept of educational utilization as an overlooked part of the education-to-work transition and a potential mechanism by which occupational sex segregation is generated among the college-educated labor force. The paper begins with a critical discussion of the operationalization approaches that have been used in prior research that implicitly measures educational utilization. Multiple empirical measure of the concept are then developed using data from the O(*)NET and the National Surveys of College Graduates. The explanatory power of each measure is assessed using conditional logit models of occupational attainment. A combined measure is then used to assess sex differences in educational utilization using data from the 1993 and 2003 National Surveys of College Graduates for 2 cohorts of college graduates-those who earned their baccalaureate or post-baccalaureate degrees and entered the labor market in the years 1985-1993 and 1995-2003. The analysis identifies sex differences in educational utilization that vary across field, degree level and cohort and concludes with an examination of the implications of sex differences in educational utilization for occupational segregation.	1	Kimberlee A.

Stephan, Jennifer, James Rosenbaum & Ann Person. 2009. 'Stratification in College Entry and Completion.' Social Science Research. 38:3 572-593.	Social Science Research	2009	12	This paper examines stratification of opportunities in college access and completion. Using propensity score methods, we investigate two comparisons: (1) four- versus two-year public colleges and (2) private versus public two-year colleges. While previous research finds lower degree completion in two-year than in four-year public colleges, the comparability of students is doubtful. This paper re-considers the public four-year college effect, but for similar students and additional relevant outcomes. The second comparison is a new one. Though recruiting similar students as public two-year colleges, private two-year colleges use different organizational procedures, and we find that they have a different impact on comparable students' degree completion. We speculate about the reasons for these differences and whether they suggest potential benefits of adapting these procedures for public two-year colleges.	3	Jennifer L. Stephan; James E.

Social Science Research	2009	4	This paper examines the effect of employment-supportive policies and arrangements on women's economic contribution to their family. Using samples of working-age couples in 21 countries we employ multilevel modeling to separate the effects of household and country-level variables on earnings. We distinguish two types of relevant contextual factors: those that support women's employment while preserving their domestic roles and those that potentially reduce intra-family economic inequalities by allowing women to allocate more of their time to paid employment. The findings suggest that all employment-supportive policies and arrangements increase women's relative contribution to the household income through their effect on female labor force participation. Among dual-earner families, however, higher rates of childcare facilities increase women's contribution, while long maternity leave and part-time employment decrease it. These tendencies are more pronounced among mothers.	2	Haya Stier; Hadas Mandel
Sutphin, Suzanne & Brent Simpson. 2009. 'the Role of Self-evaluations in Legitimizing Social Inequality.' Social Science Research. 38:3 609-621.	Social Science Research	2009	1	This research addresses a long standing puzzle in the social sciences: why are stratified social systems accepted as legitimate (the way things ``ought'' to be) by those who are advantaged and those who are disadvantaged by them? We build on previous studies of self-evaluations to explain the legitimation of inequality. The research consists of two experiments designed to test the self-evaluation theory of legitimacy. The theory proposes that structural inequality becomes legitimated when individuals' self-evaluations and the level of resources they receive are congruent. Study I examines the impact of structural power on self-evaluations. Results show that participants randomly assigned to advantaged positions in power structures earn more rewards and, as a result, develop higher self-evaluations than those randomly assigned to disadvantaged positions. Study 2 addresses the relationship between self-evaluations and legitimated structural inequality by testing competing hypotheses of legitimacy. The results partially support the self-evaluation theory and partially support competing arguments about legitimacy. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our work and suggestions for future research.	2	Suzanne Taylor Sutphin; Brent Simpson
Sun, Yongmin & Yuanzhang Li. 2009. 'Parental Divorce, Sibship Size, Family Resources, and Children's Academic Performance.' Social Science Research. 38:3 622-634.	Social Science Research	2009	3	Using data from 19,839 adolescents from the National Education Longitudinal Study, this study investigates whether the effects of parental divorce on adolescents' academic test performance vary by sibship size. Analyses show that the negative effect of divorce on adolescent performance attenuates as sibship size increases. On the other side of the interaction, the inverse relationship between sibship size and test performance is weaker in disrupted than in two-biological-parent families. Trends of such interactions are evident when sibship size is examined either as a continuous or a categorical measure. Finally, the observed interactions on adolescents' academic performance are completely explained by variations in parental financial, human, cultural, and social resources. In sum, this study underlines the importance of treating the effect of parental divorce as a variable and calls for more research to identify child and family features that may change the magnitude of such an effect.	2	Yongmin Sun; Yuanzhang Li

Social Science Research	2009	1	The Catholic Church has had a strong influence on the Chilean legal and social landscape in ways that have adversely affected victims of intimate partner violence; e.g., it succeeded until just five years ago in blocking efforts to legalize divorce. At the same time, quantitative studies based on survey data from the United States and other countries show a generally favorable influence of religion on health and many other domains of life, including intimate partner violence. The present study explores the puzzle posed by these seemingly opposing macro- and micro-level forces. Results based on data from the 2005 Survey of Student Well-Being, a questionnaire on gender-based violence administered to students at a large public university in Chile, show that moderate or low levels of religiosity are associated with reduced vulnerability to violence, but high levels are not. This non-linearity sheds light on the puzzle, because at the macro level the religious views shaping Chile's legal and social environment have been extreme.	3	Evelyn L. Lehrer; Vivian L.

Ekert-Jaffe, Olivia & Haya Stier. 2009. 'Normative or Economic Behavior? Fertility and Women's Employment in Israel.' Social Science Research. 38:3 644-655.	Social Science Research	2009	3	Women's employment and childrearing are competing activities, which exert much pressure on their time and energy. Many studies have found that women in paid employment, especially in a demanding career, limit their fertility and have few children or none. This negative correlation was explained mainly in terms of opportunity costs and the incompatibility of women's employment and childrearing. This study focuses on the interplay between women's employment and fertility decisions in Israel, a socially diverse country, characterized by high levels of both fertility and female employment. We argue that in an environment which supports and encourages high fertility women's employment activity is less consequential for family planning. The study analyzes simultaneously the decision to have a third child and the decision to work. The findings show that fertility affects negatively women's work activity, but women's employment has no effect on their decision to have an additional child. Also, cultural variables affect the fertility decision but not economic considerations, while the opposite holds for the work decision.	2	Olivia Ekert-Jaffe; Haya Stier

Social Science Research	2009	15	A growing body of research investigates the possible relationships between religion and mental health. After developing a series of arguments linking various aspects of religion with anxiety and tranquility, we test relevant hypotheses using data from the 1996 General Social Survey. Results show that frequency of religious attendance and the belief in an afterlife are inversely associated with feelings of anxiety and positively associated with feelings of tranquility. However, frequency of prayer has no direct association with either outcome. Strong beliefs in the pervasiveness of sin are positively linked with anxiety but unrelated to tranquility. Finally, belief in an afterlife and frequency of prayer buffer the adverse effects of poor health and financial decline on anxiety. Implications of these findings are discussed along with study limitations and promising directions for future research.	3	Christopher G. Ellison; Amy M. Burdette; Terrence D. Hill
Craemer, Thomas. 2009. 'Psychological `self-other Overlap' and Support for Slavery Reparations.' Social Science Research. 38:3 668-680.	Social Science Research	2009	1	Neurobiological and social psychological studies suggest the existence of non-conscious `self-other overlap' that can lead individuals to identify with other individuals or groups. This paper investigates whether this effect may help to explain support by some Whites for an otherwise unpopular policy on behalf of African Americans-slavery reparations. A representative telephone survey (n = 1200) serves as baseline of comparison for an online reaction time study with a non-representative sample (n = 1341) that measures `self-other overlap' (interchangeably referred to as ``implicit closeness'' to Blacks). Partial proportional odds ordered logit analyses reveal implicit closeness to Blacks as the single most powerful predictor of support for reparations among White respondents. The magnitude of the absolute effect of implicit closeness exceeds that of traditional predictors such as racial resentment, ideology, and party identification. Methodological and political implications are discussed.	1	Thomas Craemer
Smith, Chad. 2009. 'Economic Deprivation and Racial Segregation: Comparing Superfund Sites in Portland, Oregon and Detroit, Michigan.' Social Science Research. 38:3 681-692.	Social Science Research	2009	2	The research presented here weighs the ability of two major explanations of social inequality-Massey and Denton's racial segregation explanation and Wilson's emphasis on economic deprivation (concentrated poverty)-to predict environmental inequality. Two sets of logistic regression analyses are used to predict the location of Superfund sites in Portland, Oregon and Detroit, Michigan providing a conditional understanding of environmental inequality within a larger sociological context. The analysis includes a general examination of the two theories in all census tracts in both cities and a set of analyses focusing upon Black neighborhoods in Detroit. The findings indicate that there is support for explanations of environmental inequality that include both racial segregation and economic deprivation, but that the more powerful of the two is economic deprivation. The results suggest that even though African-American neighborhoods disproportionately house Superfund sites, these facilities are more likely to be located in Black neighborhoods that are economically deprived.	1	Chad L.

Social Science Research	2009	8	Using a sample of 42,329 respondents nested within 4254 Canadian urban neighborhoods, this study demonstrates the conceptual and empirical importance of making a distinction between neighborhood racial diversity and minority concentration. and examines how each is uniquely associated with trust. Our analysis shows that at a given level of racial minority concentration, Whites are more trusting when their minority neighbors are more evenly distributed across racial minority groups. Meanwhile, Whites are less trusting as the neighborhood share of racial minorities increases. Overall, the effect of racial minority concentration tends to prevail over that of racial diversity.	2	Feng Hou; Zheng Wu
Feldmeyer, Ben. 2009. 'Immigration and Violence: the Offsetting Effects of Immigrant Concentration on Latino Violence.' Social Science Research. 38:3 717-731.	Social Science Research	2009	15	Despite longstanding interest in the effects of immigration on American society, there are few studies that examine the relationship between immigration and crime. Drawing from social disorganization theory and community resource/social capital perspectives, this study examines the effects of Latino immigration on Latino violence. Data on violence (i.e., homicide, robbery, and Violent Index) and the structural conditions of Latino populations are drawn from the California Arrest Data (CAL), New York State Arrest Data (NYSAD), and U.S. Census data for approximately 400 census places during the 1999-2001 period. Findings suggest that immigrant concentration has no direct effect on Latino homicide or Violent Index rates but may reduce Latino robbery. Immigration also appears to have multiple, offsetting indirect effects on Latino violence that work through social disorganization and community resource measures. These results suggest that(l) immigrant concentration does not contribute to Latino violence and may even reduce some forms of violence, (2) immigration simultaneously stabilizes and destabilizes structural conditions in Latino populations, and (3) it is useful to examine both the direct and indirect effects of immigration on crime.	1	Ben Feldmeyer

Social Science Research	2009	6	Do alcohol use and binge drinking among Latina/o adolescents increase in the second and third generation? This study explores generational differences in alcohol use behaviors for three Latina/o ethnic groups. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health on 1504 Latina/o adolescents in secondary school, we found that the factors associated with alcohol use behaviors differed across the Latina/o groups. For Mexican and Cuban adolescents, but not Puerto Ricans, immigrant generation was associated with alcohol use. For Mexican, but not Cuban adolescents, acculturation mediated the effect of immigrant generation on alcohol use behaviors. Although generally social capital and a coethnic presence were protective factors against alcohol use behaviors, we found that some forms of social capital were actually risk factors for Cubans and Puerto Ricans. Our results provide support for segmented-assimilation theory.	3	Tamela McNulty Eitle; Ana-Maria Gonzalez Wahl; Elizabeth Aranda
Poston, Dudley, Li Zhang, David Gotcher & Yuan Gu. 2009. 'the Effect of Climate on Migration: United States, 1995-2000.' Social Science Research. 38:3 743-753.	Social Science Research	2009	5	This paper examines the effect of climate on migration. We examine whether climate is an influential factor in internal migration. We assume that most persons tend to avoid exposure to bitter and cold winters, and excessively hot and humid Summers, preferring climates between these extremes. When engaging in-migration decision-making, therefore, to the extent possible, considerations involving climate are believed to be brought into the calculus. There is a very limited demographic literature on the effects of climate on migration. In this paper, we undertake an aggregate-based analysis of the effect of climate on migration. We examine this relationship among the 50 states of the United States. We focus attention on the varying effects of climate on three migration measures for the 19952000 time period, namely, in-migration, out-migration, and net migration. We next evaluate the effect of climate on migration in the context of a broad application of human ecology. Here climate, a manifestation of the physical environment, is measured with three major independent variables. The other ecological predictors pertaining to organization, population, technology, and the social environment are used as controls. This enables us to examine the effects of climate on migration in the context of competing ecological hypotheses.	4	Dudley L. Poston; Li Zhang; David J. Gotcher; Yuan Gu

The clash between the system and this human flow originates in the large number of immigrants who are unauthorized, poor, and uninsured and, hence, unable to access a system largely based on ability to pay. Basic concepts from sociological theory are brought to bear on the analysis of this clash and its consequences. Data from a recently completed study of health institutions in three areas of the United States are used as an empirical basis to illustrate various aspects of this complex relation. Implications of our results for theory and future health policy are discussed.	3	Alejandro Portes; Donald Light; Patricia Fernandez-Kelly
Ueno, Koji. 2009. 'Same-race Friendships and School Attachment: Demonstrating the Interaction Between Personal Network and School Composition(1).' Sociological Forum. 24:3 515-537.	Sociological Forum	2009	5	Previous research has demonstrated that students are strongly attached to school when many same-race peers are present. This study extends the literature by considering students' immediate social environment at school-egocentric friendship networks. I hypothesized that same-race friendships contribute to school attachment by increasing the amount of support that students receive for their racial backgrounds in direct interactions. Further, the association between same-race friendships and school attachment should be stronger when the school includes many same-race peers because the organizational condition increases the ability of same-race friendships to connect students to the major components of school-wide networks and reduces perceived racial contrast between friends and nonfriend peers. Statistical analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) provided some support for these hypotheses, but white, black, Hispanic, and Asian students showed somewhat different patterns, suggesting group differences in how students develop and view same-race friendships. The study highlights the importance of individual agency in navigating the multileveled social environment as well as the ability of organizational contexts to shift emotional consequences of personal relationships.	1	Koji Ueno
Karakayali, Nedim. 2009. 'Social Distance and Affective Orientations(1).' Sociological Forum. 24:3 538-562.	Sociological Forum	2009	7	Most groups have social distance norms that differentiate ``us'' from ``them.'' Contrary to a widespread assumption in the sociological literature, however, these normative distinctions, even when they are collectively recognized, do not always overlap with the affective orientations of group members in a uniform manner. Relations between normatively close members of a group are not always warm and friendly, and normatively distant groups can sometimes be an object of reverence and love. In this study, a typology of five different ways in which normatively distant groups can be perceived is presented: as competitors, allies, symbols of otherness, saviors, and ambivalent figures. Each type tends to emerge under certain circumstances and triggers different affective orientations. This typology is not a substitute for a general theory, but it aims to provide preliminary insights for investigating why affective orientations toward normatively distant groups take different forms and, more generally, to motivate further inquiry into the relationships between different dimensions of social distance.	1	Nedim Karakayali

Sociological Forum	2009	8	What factors determine whether and how deeply countries will commit to the international human rights regime? Using data for up to 142 countries between 1966 and 2000, this article analyzes patterns of membership to the International Human Rights Covenants. The analysis produced two main conclusions. First, the potential costs associated with joining a treaty, rather than its substantive content, motivates the decision to join. Treaties that protect different rights but establish comparable implementation mechanisms exhibit similar patterns of membership, whereas treaties that protect identical rights but establish different implementation provisions exhibit dissimilar patterns of membership. Second, rates of treaty membership differ by level of commitment. Countries that sign human rights treaties differ from countries that ratify. Results are interpreted with respect to four theories of commitment and compliance: realism, liberalism, constructivism, and sociological institutionalism. Theories that emphasize the importance of a treaty's costs (realism and institutionalism) fare better than theories that prioritize a treaty's content (liberalism and constructivism).	1	Wade M. Cole
Morales, Maria. 2009. 'Ethnic-controlled Economy or Segregation? Exploring Inequality in Latina/o Co-ethnic Jobsites(1).' Sociological Forum. 24:3 589-610.	Sociological Forum	2009	2	Recent research has increasingly focused on how ethnicity operates within labor markets. Due to perceptions of intragroup homogeneity and assumptions that inequality only occurs between majority whites and people of color, most research has neglected intragroup economic inequality. This study examines how skin color, immigration/nativity status, and gender influence wage differentials in Latina/o co-ethnic jobsites (where workers are the same ethnicity). Using data from the Los Angeles Study of Urban Inequality (LASUI), it is found that there are skin color, immigration/nativity status, and sex wage gaps among Latina/os working in co-ethnic jobsites. Moreover, illustrating intersectionality, immigrant women and dark-skinned immigrants suffer from wage gaps in co-ethnic jobsites. Unexpectedly, some Latinas experience a wage advantage, in comparison with Latinos, which is associated with lighter skin. The author suggests that Latinas are subjected to multiple-jeopardy situations in which they experience an intersection of inequalities in jobsites saturated by co-ethnics but that lightness of skin color functions as a form of social capital. Thus, research on the benefits or costs associated with working with co-ethnics cannot be extended to the entire ethnic group. The conclusion is that for Central Americans and Mexicans, co-ethnic jobsites are generally forms of segregated employment with limited protection from discrimination.	1	Maria Cristina Morales
Hunnicutt, Gwen & Kristy Andrews. 2009. 'Tragic Narratives in Popular Culture: Depictions of Homicide in Rap Music(1).' Sociological Forum. 24:3 611-630.	Sociological Forum	2009	1	Homicide is a rare event, but depictions of it are quite common in our culture and discourse. Commercially successful rappers have appropriated homicide as a central theme in their lyrical compositions. The tremendous success of rap music is indicative of its increasing popular appeal and cultural impact. We reveal the ways homicide is constructed within rap music and its frequency of occurrence across time. Employing a cultural criminology framework, we analyze the most popular rap songs over the period 1989-2000, as determined by Billboard music charts, for references to homicide. Using content analysis we explore the emergent themes associated with homicide scenarios in rap lyrics. Results show violent death was constructed in glorified ways, incorporated cautionary tales, or used as an analogy for powerful rhyming. The major themes found in these homicide-related rap lyrics were the normalization of killing, respect maintenance, confrontation with the power structure, vengeance, and masculine confrontation. Gender patterns of killing were surprising and distinct. Homicide was almost always male on male. Careful consideration is given to the multiple meanings of homicide, particularly the ways rappers have appropriated the word ``killing'' and transformed it into a term that indicates creative success.	2	Gwen Hunnicutt; Kristy Humble Andrews
Bell, Shannon. 2009. '``there Ain't No Bond in Town Like There Used to Be'': the Destruction of Social Capital in the West Virginia Coalfields(1).' Sociological Forum. 24:3 631-657.	Sociological Forum	2009	12	There is a paucity of research focusing on the circumstances that cause or contribute to a decline in social capital within communities. Furthermore, relatively few researchers employ qualitative methods in their studies of social capital, despite the multidimensional and many-layered nature of this concept, characteristics that make social capital well suited for qualitative analysis. To address these two gaps in social capital research, I explore the mechanisms that have led to a depletion of social capital in the southern coal-producing region of West Virginia. I examine whether the coal industry, which has caused bitter conflicts among residents over environmental degradation and union loyalties, has also undermined social capital in the region. My principal data include 40 semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with randomly selected individuals in a coal-mining town and a demographically similar non-coal-mining town in West Virginia. I analyze the experiences of residents in each town, assessing the qualitative differences in community and personal life associated with social capital. I find that the loss of social capital in the coal-mining community has arisen through a combination of depopulation and the community-wide conflict that arose when an anti-union coal company bought out the union coal mine at which many in the community worked, challenging the union identity so engrained in this region.	1	Shannon Elizabeth Bell
Bratter, Jenifer & Holly Heard. 2009. 'Mother's, Father's, or Both? Parental Gender and Parent-child Interactions in the Racial Classification of Adolescents(1).' Sociological Forum. 24:3 658-688.	Sociological Forum	2009	1	Research on racial identification in interracial families shows that children are more likely to be labeled as minority if the father is of minority race. Yet, prior studies have not sufficiently considered the role of parent-child relationships in shaping children's identification with either mother's or father's race. We address this limitation using data on 706 adolescents in interracial families from Wave 1 of Add Health. We examine whether adolescents identify with their mother's race or with their father's race, as opposed to selecting a multiracial identity, within specific combinations of parents' races. We also explore whether indicators of parental involvement (i.e., quantity and quality of involvement, educational involvement, and social control) explain any gender effects. Contrary to prior studies, we find that the tendency to match father's race is only true in black/white households, particularly if he is white, while adolescents in Asian/white families tend to match mothers regardless of her race. Moreover, while father's involvement, particularly educational involvement, was more likely than mother's to influence racial classification, adjusting for involvement does not explain gender patterns. This study shows that the well-known gender influences on parenting have little to do with the complex ways parent-child relationships impact racial classification.	2	Jenifer Bratter; Holly E. Heard

How can we document the repercussions, often contrary to intentions, ``back from'' such projected futures to the production and transformation of social structures? These are some of the questions to be addressed by a cultural sociology that attempts to look seriously at the effects of a projected future as a dynamic force undergirding social change. In this essay I discuss some of the reasons why the analysis of the future has been so neglected in sociological theory and research, and then sketch a possible framework for reincorporating it that specifies some of the cognitive dimensions of projectivity. In the process, I will show how a focus on future projections can help us make a link between cognition and action in a manner that has so far been neglected in the sociological literature.	1	Ann Mische
Somma, Nicolas. 2009. 'How Strong Are Strong Ties? the Conditional Effectiveness of Strong Ties in Protest Recruitment Attempts.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:3 289-308.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	2	Why do some individuals accept invitations to participate in protest events while others do not? Using the Citizen Participation Study, the author finds that targets invited by recruiters to whom they are strongly tied are more likely to protest than those invited by weak or absent ties. Such effect, however, is hypothesized to vary across the socioeconomic structure. Although strong ties motivate targets to accept the invitation, only those with sufficient resources could translate motivation into action. Consistent with this hypothesis, while strong ties roughly duplicate the chances of accepting a protest invitation when received by high socioeconomic status (SES) targets, the effectiveness of invitations disappears among low SES targets. This suggests that research about the effects of social networks on protest participation should consider how these networks are embedded in larger socioeconomic structures.	1	Nicolas M. Somma
Corrigall-Brown, Catherine, David Snow, Kelly Smith & Theron Quist. 2009. 'Explaining the Puzzle of Homeless Mobilization: an Examination of Differential Participation.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:3 309-335.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	0	In this article, the authors examine participation in protests about homelessness by an unlikely set of participants-the homeless themselves. Through an analysis of data derived from 400 structured interviews with homeless individuals in Detroit, Philadelphia, and Tucson, the authors examine why and to what extent some homeless individuals, and not others, participate in movement-sponsored protest activities. In addition, the authors assess the degree to which the factors that affect participation in this population align with previous research on participation in social movements generally. They find that certain characteristics of the homeless population reduce the importance of social ties with other homeless individuals in the recruitment process and that, contrary to what much past work would lead one to expect, homeless individuals who are less biographically available are more likely to engage in protest activity. In addition, strain, which is often not a significant predictor of engagement in other populations, is an important predictor of differential participation among the homeless. This study highlights features of the homeless population that yield somewhat different correlates of participation than found in most movement participation studies and, in turn, cautions against presuming an overall model of participation that explains the engagement of all groups in the same way.	4	Catherine Corrigall-Brown; David A.

Balaev, Mikhail. 2009. 'the Effects of International Trade on Democracy: a Panel Study of the Post-soviet World-system.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:3 337-362.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	0	The author examines the relationship between democracy and international trade using post-Soviet countries as a historical example of a world-system. World-systems theory and alternative theories are employed to create theoretical models of democracy, and pooled time-series regression is applied, using an index of democracy as the dependent variable and two sets of theoretically distinct control variables. The author finds a negative relationship between core periphery trade and democracy and a positive relationship between trade openness and democracy in the periphery. The author draws three conclusions. First, international trade deserves more attention as a link between economic and political processes in world-systems analysis. Second, contrary to conventional analysis, the structure of core-periphery trade shows that the core uses its economic ties to politically exploit the periphery. Last, it is necessary to distinguish between core and noncore international trade in world-systems and political analysis.	1	Mikhail Balaev
Pixley, Joy. 2009. 'Differentiating Careers From Jobs in the Search for Dual-career Couples.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:3 363-384.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	0	Members of social categories with multifaceted definitions are often sampled using only one or two characteristics, generating theoretical and methodological problems. Here, the author examines the case of ``dual-career'' couples. The author tests how closely respondents' and scholars' distinctions between careers versus jobs correspond and how well selected definition models capture career-oriented couples. Members of fifty-one married couples self-identify as having a job or career and then explain how they differentiate those concepts. Respondents' rationales correspond well to scholarly definitions, focusing primarily on time and emotional investments, and less on advancement or income. Work orientation generally varies, as predicted, by education and work characteristics, although many people presumed to be career-oriented report having jobs (e. g., professional women), and vice versa (e. g., part-time workers). Systematic tests of definition models suggest that many sampling approaches used in dual-career couple studies either omit many career-oriented respondents or include many who are job-oriented. Sampling strategies are discussed.	1	Joy E. Pixley
Shelton, Jason & George Wilson. 2009. 'Race, Class, and the Basis of Group Alignment: an Analysis of Support for Redistributive Policy Among Privileged Blacks.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:3 385-408.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	3	Sociological research has not adequately assessed levels of support for redistributive policy among African Americans. This oversight is particularly notable considering the dispersion of blacks across the American class structure. This article seeks to fill this gap in our understanding by addressing two concerns: (a) whether blacks with higher versus lower socioeconomic status espouse disparate policy preferences and (b) whether a privileged class position matters in the same way in structuring black and white beliefs about the role of government. Results from pooled data from the 1996 through 2006 General Social Surveys indicate that blacks more strongly support government efforts to ameliorate inequality than whites. However, black policy preferences fluctuate after controlling for intraracial socioeconomic differences. Privileged blacks are less supportive of racially-neutral opportunity-enhancing and outcome-based policies; these same respondents espouse contrasting levels of support for racially-specific policies. The implications for these findings are discussed, as well as suggestions for future research.	2	Jason E. Shelton; George Wilson
Fong, Eric & Feng Hou. 2009. 'Residential Patterns Across Generations of New Immigrant Groups.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:3 409-428.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	1	This article explores residential patterns across generations of new immigrant groups. The discussion is situated in a multi-ethnic context. The analysis is based on data from the 2001 Canadian census and focuses on three visible minority groups in the four largest metropolitan areas of Canada. In line with the spatial assimilation perspective, the authors found that visible minority groups reside in neighborhoods where, over generations, as the proportion of whites increases, the proportions of their own group and other minority groups decline. The findings also show support that socioeconomic resources are positively related to residential integration and that each successive generation is more efficient than the previous generation in translating socioeconomic resources. However, echoing the place stratification perspective, variations in the effect of socioeconomic resources within each group and generation have been documented. Taken together, the results suggest that the factors contributing to residential integration are more complicated in a multi-ethnic context.	2	Eric Fong; Feng Hou
Hennessy, Judith. 2009. 'Morality and Work-family Conflict in the Lives of Poor and Low-income Women.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:4 557-580.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	7	Contemporary understandings of work and family are largely based on middle-class women's experience, whereas poverty and welfare researchers focus on the economic struggles of single female-headed families. This qualitative study examines the cultural and moral forces underlying the tension between paid work and family responsibilities through the experience of poor and low-income women. Interview data reveal that as expected, the conditions of poverty and welfare shape work and family decisions. Yet, choices about work and family entail moral and emotional commitments defined through powerful gendered cultural schemas. Providing financially for children reflects a strong work ethic and moral worth corresponding to a masculine model of individual responsibility privileging self-sufficiency and independence. This is challenged by a shared moral imperative that mother's primary responsibility is the care of children. This examination is important for researchers in understanding the moral and emotional salience of gender in shaping the work and family lives of poor and low-income women.	1	Judith Hennessy
Desmond, Scott & Charis Kubrin. 2009. 'the Power of Place: Immigrant Communities and Adolescent Violence.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:4 581-607.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	21	Despite popular assumptions, criminologists have long recognized that crime rates are lower for various immigrant groups than for similarly disadvantaged African Americans. What accounts for this paradox? In this study, we consider the role of neighborhood context, specifically, the concentration of immigrants within a community, as a protective factor responsible, in part, for lower crime rates among various immigrant groups. We use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine the relationship between immigrant concentration and adolescent violence, controlling for a variety of individual-level and neighborhood predictors. The findings indicate that immigrant concentration is negatively related to adolescent violence. They also show the protective effects of immigrant concentration are stronger for some types of youth than others.	2	Scott A. Desmond; Charis E. Kubrin
Schieman, Scott. 2009. 'Residential Stability, Neighborhood Racial Composition, and the Subjective Assessment of Neighborhood Problems Among Older Adults.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:4 608-632.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	2	This study investigates the effects of neighborhood racial composition and residential stability-as measured by the percentage of individuals who have lived in the same location for the past five years-on perceived neighborhood problems. Among a sample of older black and white adults, findings indicate that the patterns are contingent upon residents' race. For whites who reside in neighborhoods with a low percentage of black residents, greater residential stability is associated with fewer perceived neighborhood problems net of individual- and neighborhood-level disadvantage. For blacks, greater residential stability is associated with fewer neighborhood problems, but the percentage of black residents is associated with more neighborhood problems. In both cases, individual- and neighborhood-level socioeconomic disadvantages contribute to those patterns. These findings have implications for theories about the personal and social effects of residential stability and neighborhood racial composition, as well as race differences in the links between neighborhood context and the subjective assessment of neighborhood problems.	1	Scott Schieman
Swartz, Teresa, Amy Blackstone, Christopher Uggen & Heather McLaughlin. 2009. 'Welfare and Citizenship: the Effects of Government Assistance on Young Adults' Civic Participation.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:4 633-665.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	2	Recent scholarship and public discourse highlight an apparent waning of civic engagement in the United States. Although the welfare state is generally thought to support democracy by reducing economic inequality, it may paradoxically contribute to political disempowerment of some groups. We examine the effects of state interventions on civic participation among young adults, hypothesizing that involvement with stigmatizing social programs, such as welfare, reduces political engagement, while receipt of nonstigmatizing government assistance does not dampen civic involvement. Using official voting records and survey data from the Youth Development Study (YDS), a longitudinal community sample of young adults, a series of regression models suggests that welfare recipients are less likely to vote than nonrecipients, whereas recipients of non-means-tested government assistance participate similarly to young adults who do not receive government help. These effects hold even when background factors, self-efficacy, and prior voting behavior are controlled. Welfare receipt is not associated, however, with suppressed participation in nonstate arenas such as volunteer work. Intensive interviews with YDS welfare recipients are used to illustrate and develop the analysis.	4	Teresa Toguchi Swartz; Amy Blackstone; Christopher Uggen; Heather McLaughlin
Turney, Kristin & Grace Kao. 2009. 'Assessing the Private Safety Net: Social Support Among Minority Immigrant Parents.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:4 666-692.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	5	Traditional assimilation paradigms argue that immigrants are particularly disadvantaged in feelings of marginality and dislocation. Given these paradigms, we explore how minority and immigrant status are associated with perceptions of social support among parents of young children. We use the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), a nationally representative sample of children in kindergarten in 1998 and 1999. Most groups of minority immigrant parents, compared to their native-born white counterparts, report lower levels of perceived social support, and this gap persists even when demographic and socioeconomic characteristics are held constant. Additionally, English language ability, but not years spent in the United States, attenuates the disadvantages that Hispanic immigrant parents face in their perceptions of social support compared with white immigrant parents. Finally, Hispanic parents report substantial variation in their perceptions of social support by ethnicity. As social support is an important predictor of parents' economic stability and children's well-being, these findings have important implications for children of immigrants, an important and increasing demographic group in the United States.	2	Kristin Turney; Grace Kao
Kiecolt, K., Michael Hughes & Verna Keith. 2009. 'Can a High Sense of Control and John Henryism Be Bad for Mental Health?.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:4 693-714.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	5	Social stratification profoundly affects mental health. Specifically, substantial empirical evidence finds that higher status promotes mental health via a higher sense of control and a propensity to cope actively with problems. An unresolved issue, though, is whether the effects of sense of control and active coping on mental health are uniformly beneficial across levels of socioeconomic status. Perceived control and John Henryism, an active coping style, may undermine mental health, especially for lower-status persons, who lack resources. Using data from the National Comorbidity Survey for African Americans, Hispanics, and whites, we find that both sense of control and John Henryism tend to be monotonically related to positive mental health regardless of socioeconomic status and race/ethnicity.	3	K.

Savolainen, Jukka, Petteri Sipila, Pekka Martikainen & Amy Anderson. 2009. 'Family, Community, and Lifestyle: Adolescent Victimization in Helsinki.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:4 715-738.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	3	The proximate correlates of adolescent victimization are well documented in the literature. The purpose of our research is to examine the more fundamental sources of this outcome. Focusing on two basic social contexts-the family and the residential community-we develop a theoretical model and test it empirically against a multilevel data set on juveniles living in Helsinki. Consistent with our hypothesis, we find that the family context is an important determinant of violent victimization. Much of this effect is mediated by involvement in delinquent lifestyles. We also find support for the assumption that community context matters to the risk of victimization independently of the family context and individual-level risk factors. Our research underscores the need for a multilevel approach in explanations of violent victimization.	4	Jukka Savolainen; Petteri Sipila; Pekka Martikainen; Amy L. Anderson
De, Cedric, Manali Desai & Cihan Tugal. 2009. 'Political Articulation: Parties and the Constitution of Cleavages in the United States, India, and Turkeys.' Sociological Theory. 27:3 193-219.	Sociological Theory	2009	5	Political parties do not merely reflect social divisions, they actively construct them. While this point has been alluded to in the literature, surprisingly little attempt has been made to systematically elaborate the relationship between parties and the social, which tend to be treated as separate domains contained by the disciplinary division of labor between political science and sociology. This article demonstrates the constructive role of parties in forging critical social blocs in three separate cases, India, Turkey, and the United States, offering a critique of the dominant approach to party politics that tends to underplay the autonomous role of parties in explaining the preferences, social cleavages, or epochal socioeconomic transformations of a given community. Our thesis, drawing on the work of Gramsci, Althusser, and Laclau, is that parties perform crucial articulating functions in the creation and reproduction of social cleavages. Our comparative analysis of the Republican and Democratic parties in the United States, Islamic and secularist parties in Turkey, and the Bharatiya Janata Party and Congress parties in India will demonstrate how ``political articulation'' has naturalized class, ethnic, religious, and racial formations as a basis of social division and hegemony. Our conclusion is that the process of articulation must be brought to the center of political sociology, simultaneously encompassing the study of social movements and structural change, which have constituted the orienting poles of the discipline.	3	Cedric De; Manali Desai; Cihan Tugal
Earl, Jennifer & Katrina Kimport. 2009. 'Movement Societies and Digital Protest: Fan Activism and Other Nonpolitical Protest Online.' Sociological Theory. 27:3 220-243.	Sociological Theory	2009	3	Sociologists of culture studying ``fan activism'' have noted an apparent increase in its volume, which they attribute to the growing use of the Internet to register fan claims. However, scholars have yet to measure the extent of contemporary fan activism, account for why fan discontent has been expressed through protest, or precisely specify the role of the Internet in this expansion. We argue that these questions can be addressed by drawing on a growing body of work by social movement scholars on ``movement societies,'' and more particularly on a nascent thread of this approach we develop that theorizes the appropriation of protest practices for causes outside the purview of traditional social movements. Theorizing that the Internet, as a new media, is positioned to accelerate the diffusion of protest practices, we develop and test hypotheses about the use of movement practices for fan activism and other nonpolitical claims online using data on claims made in quasi-random samples of online petitions, boycotts, and e-mailing or letter-writing campaigns. Results are supportive of our hypotheses, showing that diverse claims are being pursued online, including culturally-oriented and consumer-based claims that look very different from traditional social movement claims. Findings have implications for students of social movements, sociologists of culture, and Internet studies.	2	Jennifer Earl; Katrina Kimport
Wimmer, Andreas. 2009. 'Herder's Heritage and the Boundary-making Approach: Studying Ethnicity in Immigrant Societies.' Sociological Theory. 27:3 244-270.	Sociological Theory	2009	11	Major paradigms in immigration research, including assimilation theory, multi-culturalism, and ethnic studies, take it for granted that dividing society into ethnic groups is analytically and empirically meaningful because each of these groups is characterized by a specific culture, dense networks of solidarity, and shared identity. Three major revisions of this perspective have been proposed in the comparative ethnicity literature over the past decades, leading to a renewed concern with the emergence and transformation of ethnic boundaries. In immigration research, ``assimilation'' and ``integration'' have been reconceived as potentially reversible, power-driven processes of boundary shifting. After a synthetic summary of the major theoretical propositions of this emerging paradigm, I offer suggestions on how to bring it to fruition in future empirical research. First, major mechanisms and factors influencing the dynamics of ethnic boundary-making are specified, emphasizing the need to disentangle them from other dynamics unrelated to ethnicity. I then discuss a series of promising research designs, most based on nonethnic units of observation and analysis, that allow for a better understanding of these mechanisms and factors.	1	Andreas Wimmer
Borch, Christian. 2009. 'Body to Body: on the Political Anatomy of Crowds.' Sociological Theory. 27:3 271-290.	Sociological Theory	2009	3	This article challenges the negative image that, since the late 19th century, has been associated with crowds, and it does so by focusing on a number of bodily-anatomic aspects of crowd behavior. I first demonstrate that the work of one of the leading crowd psychologists, Gustave Le Bon, instigated a racist body politics. As a contrast to Le Bon's political program, I examine Walt Whitman's poetry and argue that the crowd may embody a democratic vision that emphasizes the social and political import of sexuality and body-to-body contact. Further, I dispute classical crowd theory's idea of an antagonistic relationship between crowds and individuality. Following Elias Canetti, I claim instead that the bodily compression of crowds in fact liberates individuals and creates a democratic transformation. The analysis results in a rehabilitation of crowds and briefly suggests how a reinterpretation of crowd behavior may inform current debates in social theory.	1	Christian Borch
Kern, Thomas. 2009. 'Cultural Performance and Political Regime Change.' Sociological Theory. 27:3 291-316.	Sociological Theory	2009	1	The question about how culture shapes the possibilities for successful democratization has been a controversial issue for decades. This article maintains that successful democratization depends not only on the distribution of political interests and resources, but to seriously challenge a political regime, the advocates of democracy require cultural legitimacy as well. Accordingly, the central question is how democratic ideas are connected to the broader culture of a social community. This issue will be addressed in the case of South Korea. The Minjung democracy movement challenged the military regime by connecting democratic ideas concerning popular sovereignty and human rights with cultural traditions. The dissidents substantiated democratic values by (1) articulating an alternative concept of political representation against the authoritarian regime, (2) increasing the cultural resonance of their concept by linking democratic ideas to traditional narratives and practices, (3) developing a rich dramaturgical repertoire of collective action, and (4) mobilizing public outrage by fusing the above three elements within historical situations.	1	Thomas Kern
Orloff, Ann. 2009. 'Gendering the Comparative Analysis of Welfare States: an Unfinished Agenda.' Sociological Theory. 27:3 317-343.	Sociological Theory	2009	17	Can feminists count on welfare states-or at least some aspects of these complex systems-as resources in the struggle for gender equality ? Gender analysts of ``welfare states'' investigate this question and the broader set of issues around the mutually constitutive relationship between systems of social provision and regulation and gender. Feminist scholars have moved to bring the contingent practice of politics back into grounded fields of action and social change and away from the reification and abstractions that had come to dominate models of politics focused on ``big'' structures and systems, including those focused on ``welfare states.'' Conceptual innovations and reconceptualizations of foundational terms have been especially prominent in the comparative scholarship on welfare states, starting with gender, and including care, autonomy, citizenship, (in)dependence, political agency, and equality. In contrast to other subfields of political science and sociology, gendered insights have to some extent been incorporated into mainstream comparative scholarship on welfare states. The arguments between feminists and mainstream scholars over the course of the last two decades have been productive, powering the development of key themes and concepts pioneered by gender scholars, including ``defamilialization,'' the significance of unpaid care work in families and the difficulties of work-family ``reconciliation,'' gendered welfare state institutions, the relation between fertility and women's employment, and the partisan correlates of different family and gender policy models. Yet the mainstream still resists the deeper implications of feminist work, and has difficulties assimilating concepts of care, gendered power, dependency, and interdependency. Thus, the agenda of gendering comparative welfare state studies remains unfinished. To develop an understanding of what might be needed to finish that agenda, I assess the gendered contributions to the analysis of modern systems of social provision, starting with the concept of gender itself, then moving to studies of the gendered division of labor (including care) and of gendered political power.	1	Ann Shola Orloff

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	7	Three decades of conversation analytic investigations of medical interaction have produced a rich collection of findings of sociological interest, from a diverse array of encounters. This paper briefly outlines the development of this field to provide a context for the special issue. The paper discusses how studies of doctor-patient interaction have revealed the ways in which participants organise the medical visit to accomplish tasks such as diagnosing and recommending treatment for illness, and how doctors and patients address various interactional issues and dilemmas that arise as they undertake these tasks. It then highlights a growing number of CA studies that explore medical settings and activities beyond the doctor-patient encounter. In doing so, it charts the distinctive interactional practices that emerge, for example, where participants are engaging in hands-on treatment, medical practitioners are interacting with one another, or various technologies are employed during the encounter. Finally, papers in this special issue are introduced and shown to build upon this latter tradition. The papers address distinctive practical problems and institutional dilemmas that arise in healthcare encounters and medical settings beyond dyadic doctor-patient interaction, with a focus on the participants' orientations to policy, their distinctive modes of participation, and the use of technology.	3	Alison Pilnick; Jon Hindmarsh; Virginia Teas Gill

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	2	Altruistic actions such as the donation of public goods have long been the subject of social scientific debate. While scholars have recognised the importance of analysing the solicitation of donated goods such as human organs and tissues, to date none has examined actual interaction for this fateful event as it unfolds in real time. In this paper, we use data from 186 audio-recorded telephone interactions between donation centre personnel and family members of the recently deceased along with in-depth interviews and observations conducted in the call centre, to examine this particular donation solicitation interaction. Using conversation analysis, we demonstrate the step-by-step sequencing of the interaction that begins with the ringing phone generated by the call centre personnel which eventually leads to the formulation of the reason for the call, the tacit donation solicitation. Our close analysis of the sequential organisation of this interaction shows how solicitation is done cautiously, incrementally, and tacitly rather than overtly, reflecting its status as a dispreferred action. This analysis suggests that configurations in the wording of solicitations may operate interactionally but inadvertently to discourage the act of donation that call centre personnel are attempting to elicit.	2	T.

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	3	Child Health Line is a 24-hour Australian helpline that offers information and support for parents and families on child development and parenting. The helpline guidelines suggest that nurses should not offer medical advice; they do, however, regularly receive calls seeking such advice. This paper examines how the service guidelines are talked into being through the nurses' management of callers' requests for medical advice and information, and shows how nurses orient to the boundaries of their professional role and institutionally regulated authority. Three ways in which the child health nurses manage medical advice and information seeking are discussed: using membership as a nurse to establish boundaries of expertise, privileging parental authority regarding decision making about seeking treatment for their child, and respecifying a `medical' problem as a child development issue. The paper contributes to research on medical authority, and nurse authority in particular, by demonstrating the impact of institutional roles and guidelines on displays of knowledge and expertise. More generally, it contributes to an understanding of the interactional enactment and consequences of service guidelines for telehealth practice, with implications for training, policy and service delivery.	4	Carly W.

Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:6, SI 835-853.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	6	This paper examines healthcare communication between physiotherapists and patients during treatment sessions, using the perspectives and methods of conversation analysis. In particular, it examines communication about reasons and rationale for treatment actions by analysing physiotherapists' accounts (explanations) for these actions during treatment sessions. Circumstances in which accounts arise are identified, structural aspects described and their functions demonstrated. These accounts can be persuasive, can foster mutuality, minimise resistance and provide education. They contribute to sensitive handling of patients' physical failures and of removing clothing. Questions arising, but as yet unanswered, include whether clinicians' accounts impact on patients' perceptions and their long-term outcomes. Analysis sheds some light on why observers have found accounts are uncommon in actual consultations. It thereby contributes to sociological understandings about why certain matters are and are not communicated during healthcare encounters, demonstrating the significance of practical and interactional constraints. The findings also provide clinically relevant information about when and how accounts can be provided, and what accounting can achieve in terms of both local procedures and the overall character of the consultation and relationship.	1	Ruth Parry

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	7	As governments and healthcare systems grow increasingly concerned with the current obesity `epidemic', sociological interest in the condition has also increased. Despite the emergence of work discussing obesity as a social phenomenon, the sociological dimensions of medical weight-loss treatments for obesity remain underexplored. This paper reports on a conversation analytic (CA) study and describes how moral issues surrounding weight and patienthood become visible when doctors and patients discuss obesity. Consultations in two UK National Health Service clinics were video-recorded and analysed to identify recurring patterns of interaction. This paper describes how patients answer opening questions: questions which begin the consultation, enabling patients to report their medical status. Analysis reveals that when producing their answers, patients typically imply either `success' or `lack of success' in their weight-loss progress. Whilst doing so, they construct their personal agency in different ways, crediting themselves for implied successes and resisting responsibility for lack of success. Through interaction the doctor and patient collaboratively construct obesity as a moral issue. The moral obligations invoked share similarities with certain perceived normative dynamics surrounding obesity and the responsibilities of patienthood. These findings have relevance to healthcare practice and add to sociological understanding of the modern obesity `crisis'.	1	Helena Webb

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	1	This article examines how older paediatric patients (10-18 years) initiate different actions, including the solicitation of parental assistance, to accomplish the task of answering clinicians' symptom questions in three paediatric tertiary care clinics. Using the qualitative method of conversation analysis to examine children's symptom accounts in 69 video-recorded outpatient intake visits, I describe four child-initiated strategies that preclude, solicit and limit parental assistance in the interactional environment of having difficulties in providing an answer. These strategies are: children's own answer searches, children's solicitations of corroboration, children's solicitations of an answer, and children's answer completions. Supported by the clinicians' strong commitment to child-centredness, children manage to solicit parental assistance without losing the opportunity to present their own symptom accounts.	1	Ignasi Clemente

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	4	In this paper we address the ways in which surgeons, in collaboration with other members of the surgical team, create occasions for demonstration and instruction within the highly complex and demanding tasks of a surgical operation. Drawing on video recordings of surgical operations, augmented by field studies, we examine how particular phenomena and procedures are made accessible and intelligible to trainees and the ways in which brief episodes of insight and instruction enable complex procedures to be followed and understood. We consider the ways in which demonstration and instruction are achieved, whilst preserving the integrity of medical practice, and explore how trainees are provided with the opportunity to witness, and learn from, the contingent deployment of formal procedures in particular cases. We conclude by considering our observations in the light of recent discussions of practice and situated learning in healthcare training.	3	Marcus Sanchez Svensson; Paul Luff; Christian Heath
Jones, Aled. 2009. 'Creating History: Documents and Patient Participation in Nurse-patient Interviews.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:6, SI 907-923.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	4	Strongly worded directives regarding the need for increased patient participation during nursing interaction with patients have recently appeared in a range of `best-practice' documents. This paper focuses on one area of nurse-patient communication, the hospital admission interview, which has been put forward as an ideal arena for increased patient participation. It uses data from a total of 27 admission interviews, extensive periods of participant observation and analysis of nursing records to examine how hospital admission interviews are performed by nurses and patients. Analysis shows that topics discussed during admission closely follow the layout of the admission document which nurses complete during the interview. Whilst it is tempting to describe the admission document as a `super technological power' in influencing the interaction and restricting patient participation, this analysis attempts a more rounded reading of the data. Findings demonstrate that, whilst opportunities for patient participation were rare, admission interviews are complex interactional episodes that often belie simplistic or prescriptive guidance regarding interaction between nurses and patients. In particular, issue is taken with the lack of contextual and conceptual clarity with which best-practice guidelines are written.	1	Aled Jones

Using data from an ongoing ethnographic study of healthcare documentation production, this paper examines the process of medical record creation through the use of speech recognition technology (SRT) and subsequent editing by medical transcriptionists (MTs). Informed by ethnomethodology (EM) and conversation analysis (CA), the results demonstrate the professional knowledge involved in the work of medical transcription, which includes a combination of skilled worksite practices and an orientation toward the social order properties of recorded dictation. Furthermore, we examine how the advantages and limitations of SRTs can impact the work of transcription. We conclude with strategic recommendations for using SRTs to support medical records production and recommend against total automation.	4	Gary C.

Lee, Daniel. 2009. 'Maria of the Oak: Society and the Problem of Divine Intervention.' Sociology of Religion. 70:3 213-231.	Sociology of Religion	2009	1	Maria of the Oak is a religious shrine located within an ancient grove of oaks in Germany. Thousands of religious pilgrims visit the site each year because of the ``healing and helping power'' of a legendary oak tree. This paper analyzes the content of written documents left by visitors and discusses the religious function and form of society that is reproduced. From the perspective of social system theory, religion appears to use this specific location to structure personal expressions of the sacred into a relatively organized but freely developing chain of communication that is devoted to solving the problem of recognizing and steering divine intervention. Maria of the Oak functions when the social system of religion successfully shifts responsibility for experiencing divine intervention from itself to individual believers. This shifting creates the opportunity for religion to inform itself with the other-reference of cooperating pilgrims, without breeching its own operational closure.	1	Daniel B. Lee
Gallagher, Sally & Chelsea Newton. 2009. 'Defining Spiritual Growth: Congregations, Community, and Connectedness.' Sociology of Religion. 70:3 232-261.	Sociology of Religion	2009	3	This article explores the concepts, means, and objectives of spiritual growth across four strands of Christianity. Based on focus group interviews and congregational observations within four congregations (conservative Protestant, mainline Protestant, Eastern Orthodox, and an emerging church), we assess the ways in which regular attenders articulate concepts of spiritual growth, the practices that contribute to their sense of growth, and how a commonly shared vision about what spiritual growth is and how it takes place contributes to a sense of congregational community. We find both expected variation across strands of tradition, as well as similarities (particularly within Protestant groups) in framing spiritual growth as an open ended and somewhat ambiguous process in which the personal and emotional resources of the community support a sense of personal growth and well-being. Our findings also suggest some support for the notion that churches with strong and clear core messages of spiritual growth cultivate stronger congregational commitments-a topic we argue should be further explored in future research.	2	Sally K.

Tavory, Iddo & Yehuda Goodman. 2009. '``a Collective of Individuals'': Between Self and Solidarity in a Rainbow Gathering.' Sociology of Religion. 70:3 262-284.	Sociology of Religion	2009	1	Using ethnographic fieldwork, this paper examines the relation between practices of individuality and solidarity in an alternative spiritual gathering called ``The Rainbow'' in Israel. Following the ``practice turn'' in sociological theory, we chart the social situations in which solidarity and individuality are formed, and the ways in which their multiple uses frame their meanings. We demonstrate that though members use the communal arena to express their individuality, the self they celebrate is constantly molded by practices creating solidarity. Through institutionalized rituals, everyday metaphors and interactions, and the formation of friendships in the field, members both relate to the community as a site for the assertion of selfhood, and incorporate the communal into the very definition of the self-thus weaving them together in action.	2	Iddo Tavory; Yehuda C.

Elliott, Marta & R. Hayward. 2009. 'Religion and Life Satisfaction Worldwide: the Role of Government Regulation.' Sociology of Religion. 70:3 285-310.	Sociology of Religion	2009	9	This paper presents a cross-national test of the effects of personal religious identity and participation in organized religion on psychological well-being, and examines whether their effects vary as a function of the degree of government regulation of individual liberties in a given country. These questions are explored with the cross-sectional fourth wave of the World Values Surveys, utilizing data from 65 countries and hierarchical linear modeling to test cross-level effects. The results indicate two key findings: (1) personal religious identity is positively associated with life satisfaction throughout the world, but the association increases in size under conditions of greater governmental regulation; and, (2) the association between participation in organized religion and life satisfaction is positive under conditions of low government regulation, is attenuated as government regulation increases, and becomes negative when government regulation is high. The implications of these results for future research on religion and psychological well-being are discussed.	2	Marta Elliott; R. David Hayward
Goldman, Marion. 2009. 'Averting Apocalypse at Rajneeshpuram.' Sociology of Religion. 70:3 311-327.	Sociology of Religion	2009	0	From 1981 to 1986, most outsiders foretold bloodshed at Rajneeshpuram, the communal city in central Oregon that was built around an Indian charismatic leader, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh (later known as Osho). However, violence never escalated to the point of mass murder, suicides, or large, collective attacks. The Rajneesh case provides a fruitful context to explore the question: How is large-scale collective violence in new religions averted? The case of Rajneeshpuram foregrounds three factors that were most important to relatively peaceful resolution of a situation fraught with danger: life-embracing doctrine, devotees' continued contact with networks outside Rajneeshpuram, and law enforcement committed to due process. Each of these influenced outcomes at different stages of tension between the group and the surrounding community. Close consideration of this case provides a framework to examine other alternative religious groups that have exploded in large-scale collective violence or appear to have the potential to do so.	1	Marion S.

Force, William. 2009. 'Consumption Styles and the Fluid Complexity of Punk Authenticity.' Symbolic Interaction. 32:4 289-309.	Symbolic Interaction	2009	5	Subcultures are distinguished in terms of what they are not, highlighting differences with broader cultural characteristics. From this perspective, authenticity is drawn from external contrasts. This ethnographic study of a local punk scene shows that internal comparisons among participants centered on consumption styles also construct authenticity. This activity was dominated by three indigenous cultural processes: the publicized possession of consumer goods, stylized presentations of self, and conversational display of acquaintance with punk esoterica. In contrast to previous studies, this article shows how the interpretive particulars of consumption in talk and interaction move beyond style alone to feature the fluid complexity of punk authenticity.	1	William Ryan Force
Kotarba, Joseph, Jennifer Fackler & Kathryn Nowotny. 2009. 'an Ethnography of Emerging Latino Music Scenes.' Symbolic Interaction. 32:4 310-333.	Symbolic Interaction	2009	3	We report on an ethnographic study of three emerging scenes in which Latino music is produced, performed, experienced, and celebrated in Houston, Texas: rock en Espanol, gay Latino dance music, and professional soccer supporters' music. Music is an important feature of Latino culture, since it informs migration, citizenship, spirituality, and other aspects of the contemporary Latino experience. Three interactionist concepts inform this study. The concept of scene directs our attention to the comprehensive social worlds driven by Latino music. The concept of idioculture directs our attention to the ways audience members experience Latino music within everyday life small groups. The concept of place directs our attention to how Latino music creates new locations to anchor the self in reference to country of origin, present music communities, or possible symbolic locations such as America or La Raza. We conclude with suggestions for a revised interactionist concept of music scene.	3	Joseph A. Kotarba; Jennifer L. Fackler; Kathryn M. Nowotny
Trammell, Rebecca & Scott Chenault. 2009. '``we Have to Take These Guys Out'': Motivations for Assaulting Incarcerated Child Molesters.' Symbolic Interaction. 32:4 334-350.	Symbolic Interaction	2009	1	We know very little about how incarcerated men justify assaults against at-risk inmates such as child molesters. For this article, we fill this gap in the literature by examining how men describe these assaults as a way to align their own violent behavior with more conventional mores. We find that formerly incarcerated men justify violence as a way to raise their own social status and promote cultural norms against child abuse. When inmates attack someone convicted of child molestation, they do so to punish him and provide a ``service'' to their community. Furthermore, they elevate their own social status and distance themselves from these offenders. Theoretically, this work broadens our understanding of verbal justifications for violent action.	2	Rebecca Trammell; Scott Chenault
Valenta, Marko. 2009. 'Immigrants' Identity Negotiations and Coping With Stigma in Different Relational Frames.' Symbolic Interaction. 32:4 351-371.	Symbolic Interaction	2009	4	This research describes strategies that immigrants deploy in face-to-face interactions with indigenous locals and links these strategies to their relational frames and networks. By focusing on interconnections between identity management and network management, the author further explores some of the key trends already documented in the contemporary literature on ethnicity. The article also adds new insight to the analysis of stigma and identity by showing how self-friend and self-stranger relationships present different opportunities and limitations for self-presentation. Network fragmentation-commonly associated with a weak degree of social integration-is not necessarily an indicator of unsuccessful integration or segregation; it may be part of a wider immigrant identity project, a way to cope with stigmatization, and an important precondition for integration into mainstream society.	1	Marko Valenta
Kane, Emily. 2009. '``i Wanted a Soul Mate'': Gendered Anticipation and Frameworks of Accountability in Parents' Preferences for Sons and Daughters.' Symbolic Interaction. 32:4 372-389.	Symbolic Interaction	2009	2	This article draws on qualitative interview data from a diverse sample of parents in New England to explore the preferences they recall having for sons or daughters prior to parenthood. Before their children even arrive, potential parents are not only building the foundation for the gendered interests and tendencies they expect those children to have but also sharpening their sense of themselves as gendered persons, through the connections they anticipate sharing with their future children. Applying Fenstermaker, West, and Zimmerman's ( 2002) approach to gender as a situated accomplishment, I argue that through their gendered anticipation, parents reproduce a framework of accountability to gendered expectations, casting as essential features of their potential children and themselves gendered tendencies that are better understood as products rather than causes of the interactions parents anticipate. I consider the significance of such anticipation not only for the children these parents eventually raised but also for reproducing the frameworks of accountability that affect other parents and children more broadly.	1	Emily W.

Tugal, Cihan. 2009. 'Transforming Everyday Life: Islamism and Social Movement Theory.' Theory and Society. 38:5 423-458.	Theory and Society	2009	3	The Islamist movement in Turkey bases its mobilization strategy on transforming everyday practices. Public challenges against the state do not form a central part of its repertoire. New Social Movement theory provides some tools for analyzing such an unconventional strategic choice. However, as Islamist mobilization also seeks to reshape the state in the long run, New Social Movement theory (with its focus on culture and society and its relative neglect of the state) needs to be complemented by more institutional analyses. A hegemonic account of mobilization, which incorporates tools from theories of everyday life and identity-formation, as well as from state-centered approaches, is offered as a way to grasp the complexity of Islamism.	1	Cihan Tugal
Chorev, Nitsan & Sarah Babb. 2009. 'the Crisis of Neoliberalism and the Future of International Institutions: a Comparison of the Imf and the Wto.' Theory and Society. 38:5 459-484.	Theory and Society	2009	11	The current crisis of neoliberalism is calling into question the relevance of key international institutions. We analyze the origins, nature, and possible impacts of the crisis through comparing two such institutions: the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Trade Organization (WTO). Both originated in the post-World War II U.S.-led hegemonic order and were transformed as part of the transition to global neoliberalism. We show that while the IMF and the WTO have been part of the same hegemonic project, their distinct institutional features have put them on significantly different trajectories. Historical differences in the two institutions' systems of rules have placed the IMF in a more vulnerable position than the WTO, which provides clues to the future contours of global economic governance.	2	Nitsan Chorev; Sarah Babb
Straughn, Jeremy. 2009. 'Culture, Memory, and Structural Change: Explaining Support for ``socialism'' in a Post-socialist Society.' Theory and Society. 38:5 485-525.	Theory and Society	2009	3	Two decades ago, East European state socialism met with a paradoxical fate. Between 1989 and 1991, communist party hegemony was abolished, leaving the very idea of socialism permanently discredited-or so it seemed. Yet in the decade that followed, ``socialistic'' principles and practices would retain-or perhaps acquire-a surprising degree of popular appeal. Was this a cultural legacy of systematic indoctrination? A strategic response to material insecurities? Perhaps a combination of both? In this article, it is argued that many previous efforts to unravel the paradox are inadequate because they ignore both the ``strategic'' dimensions of culture and the cultural dimensions of instrumental reason. Using life-history data on the former East Germany, it is shown that apparently discredited ideologies can acquire renewed salience in the wake of regime change if they (1) remain culturally available as strategies of action that (2) provided material opportunities or symbolic privileges in the past, and (3) promise to ameliorate new problems engendered by alternative strategies.	1	Jeremy Brooke Straughn
Kirshner, Jonathan. 2009. 'Keynes, Legacies, and Inquiry.' Theory and Society. 38:5 527-541.	Theory and Society	2009	1	As President Nixon once observed, ``we are all Keynesians.'' And we do indeed live in a macroeconomic world, essentially, as defined and elucidated by Keynes. But Keynes himself is underrepresented in both political science and in mainstream economics. This is a costly intellectual error. Keynes' prodigious writings, as well as his actions, offer a treasure trove of inspiration, analysis, and insight. This article considers four themes in Keynes' oeuvre that are especially worthy of revisiting: the importance of economic inequality, the potentially fragile underpinnings of international economic order, the inherent dysfunctions of the international monetary economy, and, perhaps most important, Keynes' philosophy and its relationship to economic inquiry.	1	Jonathan Kirshner
Beller, Emily. 2009. 'Bringing Intergenerational Social Mobility Research Into the Twenty-first Century: Why Mothers Matter.' American Sociological Review. 74:4 507-528.	American Sociological Review	2009	17	Conventional social mobility research, which measures family social class background relative to only fathers' characteristics, presents an outmoded picture of families-a picture wherein mothers' economic participation is neither common nor important. This article demonstrates that such measurement is theoretically and empirically untenable. Models that incorporate both mothers' and fathers' characteristics into class origin measures fit observed mobility patterns better than do conventional models, and for both men and women. Furthermore, in contrast to the current consensus that conventional measurement strategies do not alter substantive research conclusions, analyses of cohort change in social mobility illustrate the distortions that conventional practice can produce in stratification research findings. By failing to measure the impact of mothers' class, the current practice misses a recent upturn in the importance of family background for class outcomes among men in the United States. The conventional approach suggests no change between cohorts, but updated analyses reveal that inequality of opportunity increased significantly for men born since the mid-1960s compared with those born earlier in the century.	1	Emily Beller
Sanyal, Paromita. 2009. 'From Credit to Collective Action: the Role of Microfinance in Promoting Women's Social Capital and Normative Influence.' American Sociological Review. 74:4 529-550.	American Sociological Review	2009	19	Can economic ties positively influence social relations and actions? If so, how does this influence operate? Microfinance programs, which provide credit through a group-based lending strategy, provide the ideal setting for exploring these questions. This article examines whether structuring socially isolated women into peer-groups for an explicitly economic purpose, such as access to credit, has any effect on the women collective social behavior Based on interviews with 400 women from 59 microfinance groups in West Bengal, India, I find that one third of these groups undertook various collective actions. Improvements in women,v social capital and normative influence fostered this capacity for collective action. Several factors contributed to these transformations, including economic ties among members, the structure of the group network, and women participation in group meetings. Based on these findings, I argue that microfinance groups have the potential to promote women social capital and normative influence, thereby facilitating women collective empowerment. I conclude by discussing the need for refining our understanding of social capital and social ties that promote normative influence.	1	Paromita Sanyal
Schaefer, David. 2009. 'Resource Variation and the Development of Cohesion in Exchange Networks.' American Sociological Review. 74:4 551-572.	American Sociological Review	2009	8	Social exchange theories have identified social structural factors and interaction processes that build cohesion through the everyday exchange of valued resources. However, the types of resources considered in previous research do not reflect the properties of many commonly exchanged resources, namely information, social support, and material goods. In this article, I identify two resource dimensions that underlie and affect exchange: (1) duplicability, that is, whether a resource provider retains control of the resource after exchange and (2) transferability, that is, whether a resource recipient can exchange the resource in another relation. I present a causal model to explain how these dimensions affect cohesion through the mediating effects of structural power exchange frequency. and uncertainty. Notably, resource variation alters the source of structural power, making it necessary to specify when different power mechanisms will operate and their disparate effects on the other mediating factors. A laboratory experiment provides support for the causal model. Resource characteristics fundamentally shape both the exchange process and the outcomes actors experience.	1	David R. Schaefer
Kunovich, Robert. 2009. 'the Sources and Consequences of National Identification.' American Sociological Review. 74:4 573-593.	American Sociological Review	2009	22	This article examines national identification from a comparative and multilevel perspective. Building on the identity, nationalism, and prejudice literatures, I analyze relationships between societies' economic, political, and cultural characteristics (e.g., development, globalization, democratic governance, militarism, and religious and linguistic diversity), individual characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic status and minority status), and preferences for the content of national identities. I also examine relationships between national identity content and public policy preferences toward immigration, citizenship, assimilation, and foreign policy, generally. I use confirmatory factor analysis and multilevel modeling to analyze country-level data and survey data from 31 countries (from the International Social Survey Program 2003 National Identity II Module). Results suggest that individual and country characteristics help account for the variable and contested nature of national identification. Moreover the content of national identity categories has implications for public policy and intergroup relations.	1	Robert M. Kunovich
Griffin, Larry & Kenneth Bollen. 2009. 'What Do These Memories Do? Civil Rights Remembrance and Racial Attitudes.' American Sociological Review. 74:4 594-614.	American Sociological Review	2009	8	Scholarly inquiry into collective memory has fostered a host of innovative questions, perspectives, and interpretations about how individuals and communities are both constituted by the past and mobilize it for present-day projects. Race is one of the more important current issues demonstrating how the presence of the past is both potent and sorrowful in the United States. It is therefore critical to examine how memories of racial oppression, conflict, and reconstruction shape race relations. Studies of race relations, however generally ignore collective memory role in shaping racial norms and attitudes. This article uses the 1993 General Social Survey to address the silences in the collective memory and race relations literatures by examining how Americans' recollections of the civil rights movement influence their racial attitudes and racial policy preferences. Although we find that Americans' opinions about government programs targeting African Americans are unrelated to civil rights memory, respondents who spontaneously recalled the civil rights struggle and its victories as an especially important historical event generally expressed more racially liberal opinions than did those with different memories. Our findings both support the basic presupposition of collective memory studies-memory matters-and point to a fruitful innovation in the study of racial attitudes.	2	Larry J. Griffin; Kenneth A.

Marks, Gary, Heather Mbaye & Hyung Kim. 2009. 'Radicalism or Reformism? Socialist Parties Before World War I.' American Sociological Review. 74:4 615-635.	American Sociological Review	2009	3	This article builds on social movement theory to explain ideological variation among socialist, social democratic, and labor parties across 18 countries in the early twentieth century. We propose a causal argument connecting (1) the political emergence of the bourgeoisie and its middle-class allies to (2) the political space for labor unions and working-class parties, which (3) provided a setting for internal pressures and external opportunities that shaped socialist party ideology. Combining quantitative analysis and case studies, we find that the timing of civil liberties and the strength of socialist links with labor unions were decisive for reformism or radicalism. Refining Lipset's prior analysis, we qualify his claim that male suffrage provides a key to socialist orientation.	3	Gary Marks; Heather A. Mbaye; Hyung Min Kim

'All the Movements Fit to Print: Who, What, When, Where, and Why Smo Families Appeared in the New York Times in the Twentieth Century.' American Sociological Review. 74:4 636-656.	American Sociological Review	2009	16	Why did some social movement organization (SMO)families receive extensive media coverage? In this article, we elaborate and appraise four core arguments in the literature on movements and their consequences: disruption, resource mobilization, political partisanship, and whether a movement benefits from an enforced policy. Our fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analyses (fsQCA) draw on new, unique data from the New York Times across the twentieth century on more than 1,200 SMOs and 34 SMO families. At the SMO family level, coverage correlates highly with common measures of the size and disruptive activity of movements, with the labor and African American civil rights movements receiving the most coverage. Addressing why some movement families experienced daily coverage, fsQCA indicates that disruption, resource mobilization, and an enforced policy are jointly sufficient; partisanship, the standard form of ``political opportunity,'' is not part of the solution. Our results support the main perspectives, while also suggesting that movement scholars may need to reexamine their ideas of favorable political contexts.	4	Edwin Amenta; Neal Caren; Sheera Joy Olasky; James E.

Chevan, Albert & Michael Sutherland. 2009. 'Revisiting Das Gupta: Refinement and Extension of Standardization and Decomposition.' Demography. 46:3 429-449.	Demography	2009	2	Standardization and decomposition are established and widely used demographic techniques for comparing rates and means between groups with differences composition. The diffierence in rates and means has heretofore been resolved in terms of the contribution of variables to compositional effects for each variable and an overall rate effect. This study demonstrates that the resolution of differences is attainable at the categorical level for both compositional effects and rate effects. Refinements to Das Gupta's equations yield a complete decomposition because of the additivity of categorical compositional and rate effects. Other refinements allow the decomposition of polytomous variables. Extensions to the method provide for the decomposition of the standard deviation and the multivariate index of dissimilarity.	2	Albert Chevan; Michael Sutherland
Schellekens, Jona. 2009. 'Family Allowances and Fertility: Socioeconomic Differences.' Demography. 46:3 451-468.	Demography	2009	5	This article explores socioeconomic differences in the effect of family allowances on fertility. Although several studies have examined the relationship between cash benefits and fertility, few studies have addressed the possible differential effects of cash benefits on families of different income or education levels. I reconstructed the birth histories of women in the past two Israeli censuses of 1983 and 1995 to study socioeconomic differences in the effect of family allowances up to the seventh parity. The results indicate that family allowances have a significant effect at every parity. Using female education as an indicator of socioeconomic status, I find that socioeconomic status is a significant modifier of the effect of family, allowances. Family, allowances seem to have a relatively large impact on more, educated women.	1	Jona Schellekens
Pettit, Becky & Stephanie Ewert. 2009. 'Employment Gains and Wage Declines: the Erosion of Black Women's Relative Wages Since 1980.' Demography. 46:3 469-492.	Demography	2009	8	Public policy initiatives in the 1950s and 1960s, including Affirmative Action and Equal Employment Opportunity low, helped mitigate explicit discrimination in pay, and the expansion of higher education and training programs have advanced the employment fortunes of many American women. By the early 1980s, some scholars proclaimed near equity in pay between black and white women, particularly among young and highly skilled workers. More recent policy initiatives and labor market conditions have been arguably less progressive for black women's employment and earnings: through the 1980s, 1990s, and the first half of the 2000s, the wage gap between black and white women widened considerably. Using data from the Current Population Survey Merged Outgoing Rotation Group (CPS-MORG), this article documents the racial wage gap among women in the United States from 1979 to 2005. We investigate how demographic and labor market conditions influence employment and wage inequality among black and white women over the period. Although shifts in labor supply influence the magnitude of the black-white wage gap among women, structural disadvantages faced by black women help explain the growth in the racial wage gap.	2	Becky Pettit; Stephanie Ewert
Bozick, Robert. 2009. 'Job Opportunities, Economic Resources, and the Postsecondary Destinations of American Youth.' Demography. 46:3 493-512.	Demography	2009	3	Using a nationally representative sample of graduates from the high school class of 2003-2004, I test the warehouse hypothesis, which contends that youth are more likely to leave school and enter the labor force when there are available job opportunities (and vice versa). Using two measures of job opportunities-local unemployment rates and the percentage of local workers employed in Jobs that require a bachelor's degree-I find support for the warehouse hypothesis. In areas Where unemployment is low, with ample jobs that do not require a bachelor `s degree, youth have higher odds of entering the labor force. In areas where unemployment is high, with few jobs that require only a high school diploma, youth have higher odds of entering college. The effect of unemployment on enrollment is more pronounced for low-income Youth than for high-income Youth, with both low- and high-income Youth turning to four-year schools rather than two-year schools when job opportunities are limited.	1	Robert Bozick
Thomas, Kevin. 2009. 'Parental Characteristics and the Schooling Progress of the Children of Immigrant and Us-born Blacks.' Demography. 46:3 513-534.	Demography	2009	3	In this study, I examine disparities in schooling progress among children born to immigrant and U.S.-born blacks. I find that in one- and two-parent families, children born to black immigrants arc, less likely to fall behind in school than those born to U.S.-born blacks. In two-parent immigrant families, children born to two immigrant parents have a significant schooling advantage over children born to one immigrant parent. While children born to two immigrant parents in the wealthiest black immigrant families do better in the second generation than in the first, the reverse is observed among children in less wealthy families. These findings contribute in two ways to our understanding of the assimilation processes of children born to black immigrant parents. First, they show that there is a positive association between the number of immigrant parents in a family and childrens schooling performance. Second, they suggest that disparities in the assimilation patterns of the children of black immigrants are a likely product of the interaction between their parental characteristics and the socio-economic circumstances of their families.	1	Kevin J.

Orrenius, Pia & Madeline Zavodny. 2009. 'Do Immigrants Work in Riskier Jobs?.' Demography. 46:3 535-551.	Demography	2009	19	Recent media and government reports suggest that immigrants are more likely to hold jobs with poor working conditions than U.S.-born workers, perhaps because immigrants work in jobs that ``natives don't want. ``Despite this widespread view, earlier studies have not found immigrants to be in riskier jobs than natives. This study combines individual-level data from the 2003-2005 American Community Survey with Bureau of Labor Statistics data on work-related injuries and fatalities to take afresh look at whether foreign-born workers are employed in more dangerous jobs. The results indicate that immigrants are in fact more likely, to work in risky jobs than U.S.-born workers, partly due to differences in average characteristics, such as immigrants `lower English-language ability and educational attainment.	2	Pia M.

Steele, Fiona, Wendy Sigle-Rushton & Oystein Kravdal. 2009. 'Consequences of Family Disruption on Children's Educational Outcomes in Norway.' Demography. 46:3 553-574.	Demography	2009	13	Using high-quality data from Norwegian population registers, we examine the relationship between family, disruption and children educational outcomes. We distinguish between disruptions caused by parental divorce and paternal death and, using a simultaneous equation model, pay, particular attention to selection bias in the effect of divorce. We also allow for the possibility that disruption may have different effects at different stages of a child educational career. Our results suggest that selection on time-invariant maternal characteristics is important and works to overstate the effects of divorce on a child's chances of continuing in education. Nevertheless, the experience of marital breakdown during childhood is associated with lower levels of education, and the effect weakens with the child age at disruption. The effects of divorce are most pronounced for the transitions during or just beyond the high school level. In models that do not allow for selection, children who experienced a father's death appear less disadvantaged than children whose parents divorced. After we control for selection, however, cl differences in the educational qualifications of children from divorced and bereaved families narrow substantially and, at mean ages of divorce, are almost non-existent.	3	Fiona Steele; Wendy Sigle-Rushton; Oystein Kravdal
Saarela, Jan & Fjalar Finnas. 2009. 'Forced Migration and Mortality in the Very Long Term: Did Perestroika Affect Death Rates Also in Finland?.' Demography. 46:3 575-587.	Demography	2009	4	In this article, we analyze mortality rates of Finns born in areas that were ceded to the Soviet Union after World War II and from which the entire population was evacuated. These internally displaced persons arc, observed during the period 1971-2004 and compared with people born in the same region but on the adjacent side of the new border We find that in the 1970s and 1980s, the forced migrants had mortality rates that were on par with those of people in the comparison group. In the late 1980s, the mortality risk of internally displaced men increased by 20\% in relation to the expected time trend. This deviation, which manifests particularly in cardiovascular mortality. coincides with perestroika and the demise of the Soviet Union, which were events that resulted in an intense debate in civil society about restitution of the ceded areas. Because state actors were reluctant to engage, the debate declined after some few years, and after the mid-1990s, the death risk again approached the long-term trend. Our findings indicate that when internally displaced persons must adjust to situations for which appropriate coping behaviors are unknown, psychosocial stress might arise several decades after their evacuation.	2	Jan Saarela; Fjalar Finnas

Demography	2009	3	Virtually all quantitative microdata used by social scientists derive from samples that incorporate clustering, stratification, and weighting adjustments (Kish 1965, 1992). Such data can yield standard error estimates that differ dramatically from those derived from a simple random sample of the same size. Researchers using historical U.S. census microdata, however, usually apply methods designed for simple random samples. The resulting p values and confidence intervals could be inaccurate and could lead to erroneous research conclusions. Because U.S. census microdata samples are among the most widely used sources for social science and policy research, the need for reliable standard error estimation is critical. We evaluate the historical microdata samples of the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS) project from 1850 to 1950 in order to determine (1) the impact of sample design on standard error estimates, and (2) how to apply modern standard error estimation software to historical census samples. We exploit a unique new data source from the 1880 census to validate our methods for standard error estimation, and then we apply this approach to the 1850-1870 and 1900-1950 decennial censuses. We conclude that Taylor series estimation can be used effectively with the historical decennial census microdata samples and should be applied in research analyses that have the potential for substantial clustering effects.	5	Michael Davern; Steven Ruggles; Tami Swenson; J.

Jin, Lei & Nicholas Christakis. 2009. 'Investigating the Mechanism of Marital Mortality Reduction: the Transition to Widowhood and Quality of Health Care.' Demography. 46:3 605-625.	Demography	2009	8	While it is well known that the widowed suffer increased mortality risks, the mechanism of this survival disadvantage is still under investigation. In this article, we examine the quality of health care as a possible link between widowhood and mortality using a unique data set of 475,313 elderly couples who were followed up for up to nine years. We address whether the transition to widowhood affects the quality of care that individuals receive and explore the extent to which these changes mediate the elevated mortality hazard for the widowed. We analyze six established measures of quality of health care in a fixed-effect framework to account for unobserved heterogeneity. Caregiving and acute bereavement during the transition to widowhood appear to distract individuals from taking care of their own health care needs in the short run. However being widowed does not have long-term detrimental effects on individuals `ability to sustain contact with the formal medical system. Moreover: the short-run disruption does not mediate the widowhood effect on mortality. Nevertheless, long after spousal death, men suffer from a decline in the quality of informal care, coordination between formal and informal care, and the ability to advocate and communicate informal medical settings. These findings illustrate women centrality in the household production of health and identify important points of intervention in optimizing men adjustment to widowhood.	2	Lei Jin; Nicholas A.

Crimmins, Eileen, Mark Hayward, Aaron Hagedorn, Yasuhiko Saito & Nicolas Brouard. 2009. 'Change in Disability-free Life Expectancy for Americans 70 Years Old and Older.' Demography. 46:3 627-646.	Demography	2009	25	In this article, we examine changes in life expectancy free of disability using longitudinal data collected from 1984 through 2000 from two cohorts who composed the Longitudinal Studies of Aging I and II. Life expectancies with and without ADL and/or IADL disability are calculated using a Markov-based multistate life table approach. At age 70, disability-free life expectancy increased over a 10-Year period by 0.6 of a year in the later cohort, which was the same as the increase in total life expectancy, both increases marginally statistically significant. The average length of expected life with IADL and ADL disability did not change. Changes in disability-free life expectancy resulted from decreases in disability incidence and increases in the incidence of recovery from disability across the two survey cohorts. Age-specific mortality among the ADL disabled declined significantly in the later cohort after age 80. Mortality for the IADL disabled and the nondisabled did not change significantly. Those with ADL disability at age 70 experienced substantial increases in both total life expectancy and disability-free life expectancy. These results indicate the importance of efforts both to prevent and delay disability and to promote recovery from disability for increasing life expectancy without disability. Results also indicate that while reductions in incidence and increases in recovery work to decrease population prevalence of disability, declining mortality among the disabled has been a force toward increasing disability prevalence.	5	Eileen M.

Schilt, Kristen & Laurel Westbrook. 2009. 'Doing Gender, Doing Heteronormativity ``gender Normals,'' Transgender People, and the Social Maintenance of Heterosexuality.' Gender \& Society. 23:4 440-464.	Gender \& Society	2009	22	This article brings together two case studies that examine how nontransgender people, ``gender normals,'' interact with transgender people to highlight the connections between doing gender and heteronormativity. By contrasting public and private interactions that range from nonsexual to sexualized to sexual, the authors show how gender and sexuality are inextricably tied together. The authors demonstrate that the criteria for membership in a gender category are significantly different in social versus (hetero)sexual circumstances. While gender is presumed to reflect biological sex in all social interactions, the importance of doing gender in a way that represents the shape of one's genitals is heightened in sexual and sexualized situations. Responses to perceived failures to fulfill gender criteria in sexual and sexualized relationships are themselves gendered; men and women select different targets for and utilize gendered tactics to accomplish the policing of supposedly natural gender boundaries and to repair breaches to heteronormativity.	2	Kristen Schilt; Laurel Westbrook

Gender \& Society	2009	6	This article offers an analysis of lived experiences of transnational mobility for gay-identified expatriates who reside in Manila, the Philippines. Drawing from in-depth interviewing and discourse analysis of eight cases, the author argues that homonormative mobility organizes gay men's travel, even as gay expatriates work to reimagine themselves through their travel and face destabilizing experiences in transnational spaces. The author offers a theorization of homonormative mobility to explain discourses of normative gender, race-nation, and desire in gay travel. Specifically, she argues that expatriates describe their mobility as (1) an escape from the heteronormative controls they face at home, (2) masculine access to freeing places in ``foreign'' playgrounds, (3) an act of homo-orientalist desire of Filipino men and spaces, (4) a desirable experience that builds their own self-confidence, and (5) troubling for their self-perceptions.	1	Dana Collins
Wolkomir, Michelle. 2009. 'Making Heteronormative Reconciliations the Story of Romantic Love, Sexuality, and Gender in Mixed-orientation Marriages.' Gender \& Society. 23:4 494-519.	Gender \& Society	2009	5	As a central organizing institution in society, marriage presents an idealized package for sociosexual relations that reproduces and intertwines gender power dynamics and heterosexual desire. This package is sustained, in part, by the ideology of romantic love-a set of beliefs that constructs only a particular configuration of sexual and gender practices as natural, normal, and right. Drawing on interviews with 45 people, this study examines how people negotiate marital relationships that do not fit into this normative configuration mixed-orientation (e.g., straight and gay) marriages. Participants' resolutions to these situations, whether they divorced or created asexual or sexual nonmonogamous marriages, were heavily shaped by their belief in the ideology of romantic love, illustrating how heteronormative relations can be held in place by normalizing ideologies.	1	Michelle Wolkomir
Garcia, Lorena. 2009. '``now Why Do You Want to Know About That?'' Heteronormativity, Sexism, and Racism in the Sexual (mis)education of Latina Youth.' Gender \& Society. 23:4 520-541.	Gender \& Society	2009	7	Research has revealed that sex education policies are informed by national and local struggles over the meanings and consequences of gender, race, sexuality, and class categories. However, few studies have considered how policies are enacted in the classroom production of sex education to support or challenge gender, racial, sexual, and class hierarchies. This article draws on data obtained through semistructured in-depth interviews with 40 Latina youth (20 Mexican origin, 20 Puerto Rican) to explore how heteronormativity, sexism, and racism operate together to structure the content and delivery of school-based sex education. Findings suggest that some Latina youth encounter racialized heterogendered constructions and experiences that limit their access to sex-education-related information and reinforce existing inequalities.	1	Lorena Garcia
Wilkinson, Lindsey & Jennifer Pearson. 2009. 'School Culture and the Well-being of Same-sex-attracted Youth.' Gender \& Society. 23:4 542-568.	Gender \& Society	2009	12	This study assesses how variations in heteronormative culture in high schools affect the well-being of same-sex-attracted youth. The authors focus on the stigmatization of same-sex attraction (rather than identity or behavior) to better understand how heteronormativity may marginalize a wide range of youth. Specifically, the authors use data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to examine how variation across schools in football participation, religious attendance, and urban locale affects same-sex-attracted adolescents' depressive symptoms, self-esteem, fighting, and academic failure. The results suggest that though same-sex-attracted youth are at greater risk for decreased well-being, these youth are at higher risk in nonurban schools and in schools where football and religion have a larger presence. Results vary for boys and girls: The urban locale of a school has a larger impact for boys, while school religiosity has a greater impact for girls.	2	Lindsey Wilkinson; Jennifer Pearson
Nordvall, Henrik. 2009. 'Making Sense of the Social Forum on the Local Framing of a Fashionable Global Symbol.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 38:4 435-464.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	1	The worldwide emergence of Social Forums (SF), originating from Porto Alegre (Brazil) in 2001, is a key element in the movement for global justice. A growing body of literature on the forums concerns its function as a transnational venue for civil society and a global symbol for resistance against neoliberalism. However, little empirical research is carried out on the local meanings of the widespread SFs. This article reports on a case study on the organizational process of a local forum in a Swedish town. The analysis focuses on intracoalitional interaction among activists from the labor movement, Attac, and a local cultural institution. The importance of considering local framing processes and the often-neglected influence of fashion when studying the emergence of SFs is emphasized. Findings show how the dichotomy the Old versus the New became crucial in the framing process. Framed as a novelty contrasted with ``old'' socialist values, the SF was rejected by the labor movement activists as just another expression of a contemporary neoliberal trend of depoliticization. Implications for the study of the social forum phenomenon are discussed.	1	Henrik Nordvall
Contreras, Randol. 2009. '``damn, Yo-who's That Girl?'' an Ethnographic Analysis of Masculinity in Drug Robberies.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 38:4 465-492.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	6	Previous street crime research has shown that female robbers manipulate their sexuality to secure male victims. Also, the larger ethnographic drug market literature has shown how male criminals construct masculinity through the sexual and economic manipulation of women. However, both accounts miss how male criminals manipulate the masculinity of other men to victimize them. This article fills that gap, showing how male drug robbers play on the masculinity of male dealers to bait them into a robbery. Through The Girl, a female accomplice, male drug robbers lure male dealers, believing that men demonstrate masculinity through sexual relations with women. Apart from this, male drug robbers construct their own masculinity through The Girl, who is often manipulated and exploited through sexist stereotypes and practices. This research is based on ethnographic field data collected on a group of Dominican drug robbers in a South Bronx neighborhood.	1	Randol Contreras
Orend, Angela & Patricia Gagne. 2009. 'Corporate Logo Tattoos and the Commodification of the Body.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 38:4 493-517.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	2	This research explores the sociological factors underlying the increasing popularity of corporate logo tattoos. The authors draw upon critical theory, sociology of the body, and consumption to analyze data from in-depth interviews with a small sample of subjects with a corporate logo tattoo. Findings suggest that the increasing popularity of logo tattoos is a product of the commodification of culture via the culture industry. Findings show that the majority of the sample was motivated by brand loyalty and self-identification with a brand philosophy or lifestyle, while a small minority attempted to alter the intended meaning of the logo by appropriating it into a simulated meaning. This research suggests that corporate logo tattoos are one way that corporations have inscribed themselves onto the bodies and into the identities of many of those who acquire them, while others attempt to use such body modifications as a way to play with postmodern images.	2	Angela Orend; Patricia Gagne

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	3	The topic of conjugal quality provides an empirical illustration of the relevance of the configurational perspective on families. On the basis of a longitudinal sample of 1,534 couples living in Switzerland drawn from the study ``Social Stratification, Cohesion and Conflict in Contemporary Families,'' we show that various types of interdependencies with relatives and friends promote distinct conflict management strategies for couples as well as unequal levels of conjugal quality. We find that configurations characterized by supportive and noninterfering relationships with relatives and friends for both partners are associated with higher conjugal quality, whereas configurations characterized by interference are associated with lower conjugal quality.	4	Eric D.

A multivariate analysis of covariance was conducted comparing 4 outcome measures for different couple types in which individuals rated the partner higher, the same, or lower than they rated themselves on affability. Couples in which both individuals perceived themselves as more affable than the partner experienced poorer results on the relationship outcome measures, whereas couples in which both individuals perceived the partner's personality as more affable than their own experienced more positive relationship outcomes. Additional analyses with structural equation models demonstrated the consistent influence of enhancement measures on relationship outcomes for cross-sectional and longitudinal samples.	3	Dean M.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	16	The Scandinavian countries are often cited as examples of countries where cohabitation is largely indistinguishable from marriage. Using survey data from Norway and Sweden (N = 2,923) we analyzed differences between cohabitors and married individuals in relationship seriousness, relationship satisfaction, and dissolution plans. Our analyses reveal that cohabitors overall are less serious and less satisfied with their relationships and are more likely to consider ending their current relationships than are married respondents. The views of cohabitors who report that they intend to marry their current partners within 2 years, however, differ much less from those of married respondents than cohabitors with no marriage plans. This finding suggests that even in Scandinavia cohabitors are a heterogeneous group.	3	Kenneth Aarskaug Wiik; Eva Bernhardt; Turid Noack

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	7	The present study examined trajectories of marital satisfaction among couples with adolescent children and evaluated how changes in parents' conflict over raising adolescent children were associated with changes in marital satisfaction over 4 years. Using a prospective, longitudinal research design and controlling for family socioeconomic status, dyadic growth curve analysis from a sample of 431 couples with adolescent children indicated that marital satisfaction decreased over time for parents with adolescent children and that the trajectories for mothers and fathers were substantially linked. More importantly, the study demonstrated that increases or decreases in parents' marital conflict over raising adolescent children were associated with corresponding decreases or increases in marital satisfaction for both mothers and fathers.	2	Ming Cui; M.

Carr, Deborah & Kathrin Boerner. 2009. 'Do Spousal Discrepancies in Marital Quality Assessments Affect Psychological Adjustment to Widowhood?.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:3 495-509.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	2	We use prospective couple-level data from the Changing Lives of Older Couples to assess the extent to which spouses concur in their assessments of marital quality (N = 844) and whether discrepancies in spouses' marital assessments affect the bereaved spouse's psychological adjustment 6 months after loss (n = 105). Spouses' assessments of marital quality are correlated modestly (r = .45), with women offering less positive assessments. Bereaved persons who had rated their marriages more positively than their spouse at the preloss interview reported higher levels of anger 6 months postloss. We conclude that persons who offer more positive appraisals of their marriages than their spouse may view spousal loss as a particularly unjust event. We discuss implications for understanding late life marriage and spousal bereavement.	2	Deborah Carr; Kathrin Boerner

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	5	Recent decades have brought significant social changes in the industrialized West that may influence young adults' attitudes about intimate relationships, including changes in gender expectations and behaviors and changes in sexual attitudes and practices. We used data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 14,121) to compare men to women and sexual minorities to heterosexuals on ratings of the importance of love, faithfulness, commitment, financial security, and racial homogamy for successful relationships. We found that nearly all young adults adhere to dominant relationship values inherent in the romantic love ideology; we found, however, modest but significant differences by gender and sexual identity in relationship values. Significant interactions demonstrated that gender and sexual identity intersect to uniquely influence relationship views.	3	Ann Meier; Kathleen E. Hull; Timothy A. Ortyl

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	14	Research on the division of household labor has typically examined the role of time availability, relative resources, and gender ideology. We explore the gendered meaning of domestic work by examining the role of men's and women's attitudes toward household labor. Using data from the Dutch Time Competition Survey (N = 732), we find that women have more favorable attitudes toward cleaning, cooking, and child care than do men: Women enjoy it more, set higher standards for it, and feel more responsible for it. Furthermore, women's favorable and men's unfavorable attitudes are associated with women's greater contribution to household labor. Effects are stronger for housework than child care, own attitudes matter more than partner's, and men's attitudes are more influential than women's.	2	Anne-Rigt Poortman; Tanja Lippe

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	2	Grounded in the patrilineal family system in presocialist China, this study explores the intersection between generation and gender dimensions of family patriarchy in influencing marital power relations. Data come from the life stories of 80 elderly married individuals, collected during the 2000-2001 period in the city of Beijing. Patterns of male dominance in marital relations were found to be incomplete, inconsistent, and even countervailing in the presence of generation patriarchy. Consequently, women's experience with family patriarchy was mixed over the life course. They were particularly disadvantaged as daughters-in-law, but their lives were improved as they became fully integrated into the patrilineal system through reproduction and their husband's growing reliance on their contributions to family continuity.	1	Jiping Zuo

Using multilevel modeling, we found that mothers who exit coresidential relationships with biological fathers or enter coresidential relationships with nonbiological fathers reported higher levels of parenting stress than mothers in stable coresidential relationships. Mothers who enter coresidential relationships with biological fathers reported lower levels of parenting stress than mothers who remain single. Mothers' resources, especially their relationships with biological fathers, accounted for most of the associations between transitions and parenting stress, with posttransition resources being more important than pretransition resources. Mothers with high levels of education were less affected by transitions than mothers with less education.	4	Carey E. Cooper; Sara S. McLanahan; Sarah O. Meadows; Jeanne Brooks-Gunn

Results suggest that residing in a single-mother family was associated with small increases in behavior problems and decreases in achievement and that residing in a social-father family was associated with small increases in behavior problems. Family structure transitions, in general, were associated with increases in behavior problems and marginally associated with decreases in achievement. Transitioning to a single-mother family was associated with increases in behavior problems, whereas transitioning to a social-father family was associated with decreases in reading achievement.	2	Katherine Magnuson; Lawrence M.

Yet for European countries, research on the effects of divorce law on the divorce rate is scarce. Most of the existing studies are based on data from North America and provide numerous, but inconsistent, results. We use fixed-effects regression models to examine the impact of the introduction of unilateral divorce on the divorce rate in Western European countries. We find that de facto unilateral divorce practices led to a sustainable increase in the divorce rate, whereas legal rights to unilaterally divorce had no long-run effects.	2	Thorsten Kneip; Gerrit Bauer

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	10	The claim that multiple partner fertility may pose a risk of adverse outcomes for children has not been tested. We test this argument using a sample of 4,027 resident fathers and children from the Fragile Families and Child Well-being Survey by examining the pathways through which fathers' multipartnered fertility is associated with children's externalizing behaviors and physical health status at 36 months. Path analyses indicate that multiple partner fertility exerted both a significant direct and indirect effect through paternal depression to influence children's externalizing behaviors. Fathers' multiple partner fertility also exerted a significant indirect effect through one mediator-father involvement-to influence children's physical health. This evidence suggests that the disruptions brought about by multipartnered fertility are important for understanding child well-being.	3	Jacinta Bronte-Tinkew; Allison Horowitz; Mindy E. Scott

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	10	Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 781), I examined how father visitation for children born outside of marriage is affected by subsequent maternal relationship formation, focusing on the timing, type, and stability of maternal relationships. Results showed that fathers were most likely to have not seen their child at all when mothers formed a new relationship early in the child's life, especially if the new relationship was coresidential and the partner engaged in activities with the child. Fathers who initially visited their child were more likely to stop visiting their child if an initially unpartnered mother became partnered. Frequency of visitation was not as strongly affected as whether visitation occurred at all.	1	Karen Benjamin Guzzo

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	0	This study examined sons' and daughters' involvement with nonresident fathers and associated outcomes (N = 4,663). Results indicated that sons and daughters reported equal involvement with nonresident fathers on most measures of father investment, although sons reported more overnight visits, sports, and movies and feeling closer to their fathers compared to daughters. Sons and daughters generally benefited from nonresident father involvement in the same way in internalizing and externalizing problems and grades. Feeling close to one's nonresident father, however, was associated with lower internalizing problems for daughters than sons. These findings suggest that nonresident fathers should be encouraged to be equally involved with their sons and daughters, as such involvement was associated with higher levels of well-being for both sons and daughters.	3	Katherine Stamps; Alan Booth; Valarie King

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	43	Few programs to enhance fathers' engagement with children have been systematically evaluated, especially for low-income minority populations. In this study, 289 couples from primarily low-income Mexican American and European American families were randomly assigned to one of three conditions and followed for 18 months: 16-week groups for fathers, 16-week groups for couples, or a 1-time informational meeting. Compared with families in the low-dose comparison condition, intervention families showed positive effects on fathers' engagement with their children, couple relationship quality, and children's problem behaviors. Participants in couples' groups showed more consistent, longer term positive effects than those in fathers-only groups. Intervention effects were similar across family structures, income levels, and ethnicities. Implications of the results for current family policy debates are discussed.	5	Philip A.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	10	Stratification is a central issue in family research, yet relatively few studies highlight its impact on family processes. Drawing on in-depth interviews (N = 137) and observational data (N = 12), we extend Melvin Kohn's research on childrearing values by examining how parental commitments to self-direction and conformity are enacted in daily life. Consistent with Kohn's findings, middle-class parents emphasized children's self-direction, and working-class and poor parents emphasized children's conformity to external authority. Attempts to realize these values appeared paradoxical, however. Middle-class parents routinely exercised subtle forms of control while attempting to instill self-direction in their children. Conversely, working-class and poor parents tended to grant children considerable autonomy in certain domains of daily life, thereby limiting their emphasis on conformity.	2	Elliot B.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	10	We used data from the Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS I) (N = 2,031) to compare three models of how work-family conflict and enrichment might operate to predict well-being (mental health, life satisfaction, affect balance, partner relationship quality). We found no support for a relative-difference model in which the conflict-enrichment balance predicted outcomes. In the work-to-family direction, the additive model fit best: Both work-to-family conflict and work-to-family enrichment were independently linked to outcomes. In the family-to-work direction, the interactive model fit best: Family-to-work enrichment buffered the negative outcomes ordinarily linked to family-to-work conflict. Enrichment is key because with the additive model, it contributed incremental explanatory power, and with the buffering model, it conditioned conflict-outcome relationships. Work-to-family conflict and family-to-work enrichment appeared particularly salient for well-being.	4	Karen C. Gareis; Rosalind Chait Barnett; Karen A. Ertel; Lisa F. Berkman

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	0	During the economic crises Nicaragua suffered between 2000 and 2002, a conditional cash transfer program targeting poor households began operating. Using panel data on 1,397 households from the program's experimentally designed evaluation, we examined the impact of the program on household structure. Our findings suggest that the program enabled households to avoid reagglomeration during the economic crises, with households in control communities growing more than treated households. These changes were driven primarily by shifts in residence of relatively young men and women with close kinship ties to the household head. In contrast, households that received transfers continued to send off young adult members, suggesting that the program provided resources to overcome the short-term economic pressures on household structure.	3	Paul Winters; Guy Stecklov; Jessica Todd

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	3	This paper bridges the literature on childlessness, which often focuses on married White couples, to the literature on race and fertility, which often focuses on why total fertility rates and nonmarital births are higher for Blacks than Whites. Despite similarity in levels of childlessness among Black women and White women, Black trends have been largely ignored. Recent research has not adequately explored the extent to which factors driving childlessness may vary among Black and White women. We attempted to fill this gap using the National Survey of Family Growth (N = 3,628) and found many similarities in the predictors of childlessness for both races. Exceptions were the role of marital status and educational attainment.	3	Jennifer Hickes Lundquist; Michelle J. Budig; Anna Curtis

Using structural equation modeling and a nationally representative urban sample of 711 married women and 490 married men, we tested whether economic hardship and the associated family economic strain on families resulted in greater marital problems. Our results showed a modified family stress model applies to Turkey. In contrast to most previous research, economic strain had a direct effect on marital problems, and the indirect effect of strain, via emotional distress, was only significant for women. The results were interpreted in light of social and cultural factors that condition how economic distress affects marital relations.	2	Isik A. Aytac; Bruce H. Rankin
Usdansky, Margaret, Andrew London & Janet Wilmoth. 2009. 'Veteran Status, Race-ethnicity, and Marriage Among Fragile Families.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:3 768-786.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	4	We used data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 2,679 ) to examine the impact of men's past military service on the likelihood that a couple will marry within 5 years of a nonmarital birth. Logistic regression analyses showed that men's past military service increased marriage odds by 54\% for couples with Black fathers even after controlling for potential mediators. But veteran status had no effect on couples with White or Hispanic fathers. As a result, the large Black-White gap in postbirth marriage evident among couples with civilian fathers did not exist among couples with veteran fathers. Our findings bolster other evidence that military service exerts lasting and unique pro-marriage effects on Blacks.	3	Margaret L. Usdansky; Andrew S. London; Janet M. Wilmoth
Schmeer, Kammi. 2009. 'Changing Sibship Size and Educational Progress During Childhood: Evidence From the Philippines.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:3 787-801.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	1	This paper investigates the association between changes in coresident sibship size and children's educational progress in the Philippines. When conceptualized at the household level, sibship size is a dynamic aspect of the family context with potentially important implications for resources needed to support a child's education. Individual-level change models suggested that adding younger siblings in early childhood (from birth to age 9) and losing both younger and older siblings later in childhood (from age 9 to 19) were associated with less educational progress by the focal child between ages 9 and 19. These effects were additive and indicated the importance of assessing both type of change and timing in evaluating the relationship between coresident sibship size and educational progress during childhood.	1	Kammi K.

Poetics	2009	11	Musical classifications involve symbolic distinctions that are often linked to social categories, including gender. This paper addresses the relationship between social and symbolic boundaries in the US, Germany, France, and the Netherlands by looking at the distribution of media attention to various music genres as well as to male and female actors in newspapers from each country between 1955 and 2005. While the increasing legitimacy of popular music, as indicated by its growing share of newspaper space, seems to signal a decline in traditional musical hierarchies, it does not appear to weaken social boundaries based on gender. Although women often receive more attention in popular music coverage than in classical music coverage, their inclusion appears to be limited to more peripheral genres. In other words, as certain popular genres climb the aesthetic hierarchy, the media attention they receive tends to become more male-dominated. Thus, as musical hierarchies shift and new genres gain legitimacy, social hierarchies based on gender remain intact over time and across the four countries.	1	Vaughn Schmutz
Venrooij, Alex. 2009. 'the Aesthetic Discourse Space of Popular Music: 1985-86 and 2004-05.' Poetics. 37:4 315-332.	Poetics	2009	6	This article presents a comparison of the aesthetic classification system of popular music, as employed by newspaper critics in the Los Angeles Tines during 1985-86 and 2004-05. Through a relational discourse analysis of popular music album reviews, which applies the ecological technique of measuring niche spaces occupied by genres in an `aesthetic discourse space', the genre structure of popular music is compared across a time period in which the field of popular music has arguably undergone a growing `isomorphism' of aesthetic principles and a blurring of boundaries between genres. Comparison of genre structures at two points in time suggests that the perception and interpretation of diverse genres has become more similar. Moreover, the boundary between two exemplary genres - rock music and pop music - has apparently become less salient for music critics, possibly signaling a weakening of commercial boundaries within the popular music field over the last two decades.	1	Alex Venrooij
Giuffre, Katherine. 2009. 'the Return of the Natives: Globalization and Negative Ties.' Poetics. 37:4 333-347.	Poetics	2009	1	The Polynesian island of Rarotonga in the South Pacific Ocean is currently in the midst of an artistic explosion. Using a combination of ethnographic and network data, this paper examines the social structure of artists on the island and finds that it contains elements of both support and hostility. The hostility is mostly engendered by the clique of neo-traditionalist intellectuals who, although of Cook Islands ancestry, have been raised and educated abroad and have returned to the islands bringing with them a new conception of indigenous culture, political power and rights. The particular network structure on the island, however, facilitates the constant interaction of this group with others so that both positive and negative ties remain constantly activated. Acting as scapegoats and prods to each other - as well as supportive members of an art world - the artists on the island have built a network structure which facilitates a hothouse innovative environment. This lends support to the further conclusion that creativity and innovation are enhanced by social structures surrounding the creators.	1	Katherine Giuffre
Berghman, Michael & Koen Eijck. 2009. 'Visual Arts Appreciation Patterns: Crossing Horizontal and Vertical Boundaries Within the Cultural Hierarchy.' Poetics. 37:4 348-365.	Poetics	2009	8	The appreciation of nine distinct visual art styles was assessed by presenting color plates to some 3000 Flemish respondents. We set out to study the relation between vertical cultural boundary crossing, or omnivorousness, and horizontal boundary crossing, i.e., a preference for both classical and modem works within the domain of legitimate visual arts. We find that, Bourdieu's scholarship notwithstanding, a substantial proportion of our sample enjoyed both classical and modern works. This latter segment also ventured somewhat into popular culture, but markedly less than the taste group limiting its visual arts preferences to modem works. Those with a visual arts taste restricted to classical works were much less culturally active, as were those with low preference levels for most modem and classical visual art styles. The analyses demonstrate that horizontal and vertical cultural boundary crossing have different meanings and probably represent distinct strategies for distinction as well. Omnivorousness can thus occur in different ways, which calls for a reconceptualization of the concept. Breadth of taste should be seen as only one dimension of taste patterns, which need to be qualified further by the specific combination of cultural genres on which they focus.	2	Michael Berghman; Koen Eijck

Poetics	2009	2	This article examines how two types of legitimacy, economic and aesthetic, have unfolded for U.S. daytime soap operas. By constructing a history of soap operas, I describe how soap opera storytelling developed and later diffused across American genres and around the world. While soap operas gained widespread acceptance as a viable way to conduct business (economic legitimacy), they did not gain widespread acceptance as ``works of art'' (aesthetic legitimacy). I argue that soap operas did attain local aesthetic legitimacy in select groups (e.g., soap fans and producers) and postulate why that view is not shared more broadly. This article elucidates the mechanisms that foster and inhibit both economic and aesthetic legitimacy.	1	Melissa C. Scardaville

Poetics	2009	2	Critic-generated classification systems help structure the U.S. wine industry, as they provide consumers a coherent rating system that standardizes the complexities of wine products and wine appreciation. Tasting room hosts in Napa Valley are thus key because they act as intermediaries who disseminate information generated by critics to a range of consumers. This article compares the way in which hosts operate in three types of wineries. Hosts in ``mass-commercial'' wineries utilize classifications to maximize market share, hosts in ``limited-commercial'' wineries educate consumers about wine classifications and acceptable wine appreciation, and hosts in ``exclusive/elite'' wineries become gatekeepers of coveted wines that have gained notoriety from critic-generated classifications.	1	Heather Jamerson

Population Research and Policy Review	2009	0	A restrictive population policy led to almost doubling the number of newborns from one year to another in Romania in the 1960s. Twenty years later, this large generation (of women) enters a marriage market with few eligible older mates, in a society where marriage is a must. In this article, I analyze this social experiment within the broader frame of the marriage squeeze/two sex models. Using various data from censuses and surveys, I argue that the marriage market is flexible even when is confronted with disproportionately large cohorts. If the social pressure toward marriage is strong, the marriage rates do not necessarily fall, but the mating age patterns change.	1	Cristina Bradatan

Population Research and Policy Review	2009	0	Individual level differentials between migrants and nonmigrants are examined to ascertain the likelihood of return migration to a prior residence based on characteristics at the time of departure from place of origin. Analysis focuses on comparisons of Hispanics, blacks and whites, examining the odds of return migration by education, employment status, marital status, home ownership, length of residence, gender, age, and migration interval. The 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79) is utilized to identify 13,798 preliminary migrations that may be followed by at least one return migration. Findings indicate a sharp decline in propensity to return migrate as length of absence from origin increases. Regardless of length of time since the preliminary migration, both blacks and Hispanics are more likely to return migrate than are whites. Individuals who resided at place of origin for longer periods before leaving had strikingly higher odds for return migration.	5	Beth A. Wilson; E. Helen Berry; Michael B.

Weinreb, Alexander & Mariano Sana. 2009. 'the Effects of Questionnaire Translation on Demographic Data and Analysis.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:4 429-454.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	1	The collection of demographic data in developing and, increasingly, developed countries often requires the translation of a survey instrument. This article addresses the implications for data and analysis of two of the most common modes of translation. The first, the officially sanctioned-though not empirically verified-method, involves the pre-fieldwork production of a standardized translation of the template questionnaire into all or most languages in which interviews are expected to be conducted. The second, rarely acknowledged in the literature but quite common in the field, occurs where there is a mismatch between the language of the questionnaire available to the interviewer and the language in which the actual interview is conducted. In this case, it is up to the interviewer to translate from the language of the questionnaire to the language of the interview. Using the 1998 Kenya DHS, in which 23\% of interviews were translated in this non-standardized manner, we explore the effects of the two translation modes on three indicators of measurement error and on estimated multivariate relations. In general we find that the effects of non-standardized translation on univariate statistics-including higher-order variance structures-are rather moderate. The effects become magnified, however, when multivariate analysis is used. This suggests that the advantages of-and also costs associated with-standardized translation depend on the ultimate purposes of data collection.	2	Alexander A. Weinreb; Mariano Sana

Population Research and Policy Review	2009	2	This study explores the effects of educational attainment on the transition to first marriage across successive generations of women in Ghana. Considering the significant improvements in women educational attainment and career opportunities in recent decades, the paper questions the tacit assumption of prior research on the time-invariant effect of women's educational attainment on marriage timing. Using discrete time frailty models with pooled data from the 1988, 1993, 1998 and 2003 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey, women with higher educational attainment were found to have longer transition to first marriage than their less educated counterparts. More importantly, the effect of higher education on the transition to first marriage was larger among younger women even after controlling for other factors. The stronger effect among contemporary women has been discussed in relation to ideational changes on family formation and the enhanced career opportunities for contemporary educated women.	1	Stephen Obeng Gyimah

Population Research and Policy Review	2009	1	This study examines issues related to the fertility of graduate students over time. First, it examines changes in motherhood rates between 1970 and 2000 among women aged 20-49 who are enrolled in graduate school, both by themselves and relative to prevailing trends among women not enrolled in graduate school, and to other college educated women. Overall, women enrolled in graduate school are increasingly likely to be mothers of young children, and are increasingly similar to non-graduate students. Second, it examines the timing of these births, and finds that almost half of births occur while women are enrolled in graduate school. Third, a brief review of current maternity leave policies and childcare options available to graduate students is presented. Results are discussed in terms of institutional changes within academia, changes between cohorts that attended graduate school in these decades, and the policy needs of graduate student mothers.	1	Arielle Kuperberg
Lee, Hedwig, Kathleen Harris & Penny Gordon-Larsen. 2009. 'Life Course Perspectives on the Links Between Poverty and Obesity During the Transition to Young Adulthood.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:4 505-532.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	18	Increasing obesity among Americans is a serious issue in the US, especially in the pediatric and young adult population. We use a longitudinal design to examine the relationship between childhood poverty/welfare receipt and obesity onset and continuity from adolescence into young adulthood using three waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. We include multiple measures of disadvantage that co-occur with poverty and model potential mediating mechanisms within a life course framework. We find a significant effect of poverty/welfare receipt in childhood on obesity outcomes for females, but not for males. However, other measures of socioeconomic disadvantage such as neighborhood poverty, and low parental education are related to obesity in both males and females. Poverty may impact female obesity through the mediating effects of physical activity, inadequate sleep, skipping breakfast and certain forms of parental monitoring, while race is an important confounder of poverty's influence. This paper highlights the important influence of poverty and other aspects of social disadvantage on obesity outcomes during this critical transition to adulthood. Implications of this research include physical activity and parenting interventions for low-income youth. In addition, governmental efforts should be made to increase physical activity opportunities in poor neighborhoods.	3	Hedwig Lee; Kathleen Mullan Harris; Penny Gordon-Larsen
Yabiku, Scott & Sarah Schlabach. 2009. 'Social Change and the Relationships Between Education and Employment.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:4 533-549.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	3	The relationships between education and employment have long been of interest to social scientists. During the transition from a completely agricultural economy to one that is developing nonfarm opportunities, however, the relationships between education and employment may dramatically change. We examine how two components of education-schooling enrollment and attainment-affect the transition to employment for men and women in the Chitwan Valley of Nepal. Using discrete-time event history models, we find that school enrollment tends to delay employment, while school attainment accelerates employment. We also test how these effects may have changed across successive cohorts. Over time, the effects of enrollment have become stronger, while the effects of attainment appear to have weakened. These shifts in the nature of education may be related to increasing conflict between student and employee roles, as well as changes in the types and availability of employment.	2	Scott T.

McDonald, Steve, Nan Lin & Dan Ao. 2009. 'Networks of Opportunity: Gender, Race, and Job Leads.' Social Problems. 56:3 385-402.	Social Problems	2009	21	Researchers have commonly invoked isolation from job opportunities as an explanation for persistence of gender and race inequality in the labor market, but few have examined whether access to information about job opportunities varies by race and gender. Findings from nationally representative survey data reveal significant white male advantage in the number of job leads received through routine conversations when compared to white women and Hispanics. Differences in social network resources (social capital) partly explain the deficit among Hispanics, but fail to account for the job lead gap between white women and men. Further analyses show that inequality in the receipt of job information is greatest at the highest levels of supervisory authority, where white males receive substantially more job leads than women and minorities.	3	Steve McDonald; Nan Lin; Dan Ao
Hartmann, Douglas, Joseph Gerteis & Paul Croll. 2009. 'an Empirical Assessment of Whiteness Theory: Hidden From How Many?.' Social Problems. 56:3 403-424.	Social Problems	2009	13	This paper employs data from a recent national survey to offer an empirical assessment of core theoretical tenets of whiteness studies. Using survey items developed explicitly for this purpose, we analyze three specific propositions relating to whites' awareness and conception of their own racial status: the invisibility of white identity; the understanding (or lack thereof) of racial privileges; and adherence to individualistic, color-blind ideals. Consistent with whiteness theories, we find that white Americans are less aware of privilege than individuals from racial minority groups and consistently adopt color-blind, individualist ideologies. However, we also find that whites are both more connected to white identity and culture as well as more aware of the advantages of their race than many theoretical discussions suggest. We then combine these results to estimate that 15 percent of white Americans exhibit what we call ``categorical whiteness,'' a consistent and uniform adherence to the theoretical tenets that are the focus of this body of theory. We conclude by suggesting that these findings provide the basis for a more nuanced, contextualized understanding of whiteness as a social phenomenon.	3	Douglas Hartmann; Joseph Gerteis; Paul R.

Campbell, Mary. 2009. 'Multiracial Groups and Educational Inequality: a Rainbow or a Divide?.' Social Problems. 56:3 425-446.	Social Problems	2009	2	How do multiracial groups ``fit'' into the system of racial oppression and privilege in the United States? Are the outcomes of multiracial individuals explained by the Latin Americanization hypothesis (Bonilla-Silva 2002), or a hardening racial divide between blacks and all other racial groups (Gans 1999; Yancey 2006)? Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, I address these questions and show that the educational outcomes of multiracial groups and individuals are not consistently explained by measures of appearance, as suggested by these theories. Although the educational outcomes of Latinos and single-race groups are significantly associated with skin color and the racial perceptions of observers, multiracial young adults' high school and college educational outcomes are not consistently related to either measure of appearance. Parental education and family income are the most important predictors of educational outcomes for multiracial respondents across different types of outcomes. The implications of these findings for racial inequality and research on multiracial groups are discussed.	1	Mary E. Campbell
Ousey, Graham & Charis Kubrin. 2009. 'Exploring the Connection Between Immigration and Violent Crime Rates in Us Cities, 1980-2000.' Social Problems. 56:3 447-473.	Social Problems	2009	24	A popular perception is that immigration causes higher crime rates. Yet, historical and contemporary research finds that at the individual level, immigrants are not more inclined to commit crime than the native born. Knowledge of the macro-level relationship between immigration and crime, however, is characterized by important gaps. Most notably, despite the fact that immigration is a macro-level social process that unfolds over time, longitudinal macro-level research on the immigration-crime nexus is virtually nonexistent. Moreover, while several theoretical perspectives posit sound reasons why over-time changes in immigration could result in higher or lower crime rates, we currently know little about the veracity of these arguments. To address these issues, this study investigates the longitudinal relationship between immigration and violent crime across U. S. cities and provides the first empirical assessment of theoretical perspectives that offer explanations of that relationship. Findings support the argument that immigration lowers violent crime rates by bolstering intact (two-parent) family structures.	2	Graham C. Ousey; Charis E. Kubrin
Griffiths, Elizabeth & George Tita. 2009. 'Homicide in and Around Public Housing: Is Public Housing a Hotbed, a Magnet, or a Generator of Violence for the Surrounding Community?.' Social Problems. 56:3 474-493.	Social Problems	2009	7	One of the unintended consequences of decades-long public housing policy has been to concentrate the poor within communities that are at the extreme end of economic disadvantage. More than in other types of disadvantaged communities, living in public housing can sharply circumscribe the social world of its residents and isolate them from people and social institutions in surrounding areas. This study draws on the concepts of social isolation from urban sociology and offending ``awareness space'' from environmental criminology to explain why violence rates are dramatically higher in public housing compared to otherwise disadvantaged nonpublic housing neighborhoods and, moreover, whether residents or outsiders are responsible for the violence. Using homicide data for the Southeast Policing Area of Los Angeles (1980 through 1999), and relating the location of homicides within and outside of public housing to the places of residence of both victims and offenders, our research reveals that public housing developments are hotbeds of violence involving predominantly local residents. There is no evidence that public housing serves as either a magnet for violence by drawing in nonlocal offenders, or a generator of violence in surrounding neighborhoods. We conclude that this social isolation from the larger community can both escalate violence between residents inside public housing, but also limit their offending awareness space, such that the violence is contained from spreading beyond the development.	2	Elizabeth Griffiths; George Tita
Schwartz, Jennifer, Darrell Steffensmeier & Ben Feldmeyer. 2009. 'Assessing Trends in Women's Violence Via Data Triangulation: Arrests, Convictions, Incarcerations, and Victim Reports.' Social Problems. 56:3 494-525.	Social Problems	2009	13	Constructionist theories suggest the national rise in female violence arrests may be policy generated because arrest statistics are produced by violent behavior and changing official responses (e. g., net-widening enforcement policies). Normative theories attribute the rise to female behavior changes (e. g., in response to increased freedoms or hardships). We examine whether any narrowing of the arrest gender gap is borne out across offense types of varying measurement reliability, in victimization data, and across two post-arrest criminal justice stages. Advanced time-series analyses over 1980 through 2003 support the constructionist position. First, all sources show little or no increase in women's rates for the more reliably measured offenses of homicide and robbery, and for rape. Second, the assault gender gap narrows for arrests, but holds stable in victimization data. And, third, the assault gender gap narrows moderately for convictions, but is stable for imprisonment, indicating spill-over effects of more expansive arrest policies. Several factors have produced greater female representation in ``criminal assault'' arrests including (1) proactive policing targeting and formally responding to minor violence and in private contexts, (2) interventionist developmental epistemologies that blur distinctions among violence types and circumstances, (3) the rise of social movements recognizing ``hidden'' victims, (4) law and order political messages stressing greater accountability, and (5) the somewhat greater decline in male compared to female violence in the late 1990s. The problem of women's violence is largely a social construction. Rather than women becoming more violent, changes in the management of violence increasingly mask differences in the violence levels of women and men.	3	Jennifer Schwartz; Darrell J.

Pampel, Fred. 2009. 'the Persistence of Educational Disparities in Smoking.' Social Problems. 56:3 526-542.	Social Problems	2009	6	Besides reducing overall smoking prevalence, do anti-tobacco policies to raise prices and restrict locations for smoking also reduce educational disparities? Theories emphasizing proximate disincentives answers yes, suggesting that the policy changes create stronger disincentives for smoking among low education groups. A social resource or fundamental cause theory suggests in contrast that flexible and broad resource advantages of high education groups maintain inequalities in health behavior despite policy changes. Using 24 National Health Interview Surveys, this study tests these claims by describing smoking prevalence by education level from 1976 to 2006 in the United States and giving special attention to the last ten years when tax and clean-air policies have expanded. Logistic regression models that allow trends in smoking to vary by education, race, ethnicity, and nativity find a small decline in educational disparities in smoking. However, this decline stemmed from trends among Hispanic and foreign-born respondents; in contrast, smoking disparities among white, African American, and native-born respondents show no evidence of narrowing. Likely due to the greater resources of high education groups for health behavior, changes in prices and restrictions thus far have done little to reduce educational disparities.	1	Fred C. Pampel
Hughey, Matthew. 2009. 'Cinethetic Racism: White Redemption and Black Stereotypes in ``magical Negro'' Films.' Social Problems. 56:3 543-577.	Social Problems	2009	5	Recent research on African American media representations describes a trend of progressive, antiracist film production. Specifically, ``magical negro'' films (cinema highlighting lower-class, uneducated, and magical black characters who transform disheveled, uncultured, or broken white characters into competent people) have garnered both popular and critical acclaim. I build upon such evidence as a cause for both celebration and alarm. I first examine how notions of historical racism in cinema inform our comprehension of racial representations today. These understandings create an interpretive environment whereby magical black characters are relationally constructed as both positive and progressive. I then advance a production of culture approach that examines 26 films that resonate with mainstream audiences' understanding of race relations and racialized fantasies. I find that these films constitute ``cinethetic racism''-a synthesis of overt manifestations of racial cooperation and egalitarianism with latent expressions of white normativity and anti-black stereotypes. ``Magical negro'' films thus function to marginalize black agency, empower normalized and hegemonic forms of whiteness, and glorify powerful black characters in so long as they are placed in racially subservient positions. The narratives of these films thereby subversively reaffirm the racial status quo and relations of domination by echoing the changing and mystified forms of contemporary racism rather than serving as evidence of racial progress or a decline in the significance of race.	1	Matthew W.

Lee, Jooyoung. 2009. 'Battlin' on the Corner: Techniques for Sustaining Play.' Social Problems. 56:3 578-598.	Social Problems	2009	9	Drawing from close to four years of ethnographic fieldwork, in-depth interviews, and video recordings, this paper analyzes how inner-city men sustain playful street corner rap ``battles'' in South Central Los Angeles. Although participants know that the battle is supposed to be a playful way of resolving perceived disrespect in group rap ``ciphers,'' some become `` more than play.'' Indeed, ritual insults have the power to provoke feelings of rage, which can propel individuals into violence. To sustain the playful meanings of battles, participants who offend their opponent use different nonverbal cues to signal, `` I was just playing,'' while the offended party responds with cues signaling, `` I do not have any hard feelings.'' When these moves do not work, onlookers step in between participants, tell jokes, and use other gestures to defuse escalating tensions. The techniques outlined in this article elaborate Erving Goffman's (1974) theories of `` keys'' and `` limits,'' showing how embodied and emotional cues are used to sustain the shared presumption that `` this is play.''	1	Jooyoung Lee
Widener, Patricia. 2009. 'Oil Tourism: Disasters and Destinations in Ecuador and the Philippines.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:3 266-288.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	0	This article examines the links between the petroleum and tourism industries by analyzing how an oil disaster, whether actual or perceived, may attract nature-based tourism interests. To better understand the role of communities, local governments and/or the media in establishing links between the petroleum and tourism industries, this article explores how the construction of an oil pipeline in Ecuador and an oil spill in the Philippines created opportunities for tourism. Each case contributes to our understanding of how an oil disaster supports nature-based tourism and how both industries supply a resource or an experience to nonlocal consumers, while converging to alter local communities, economies, and ecosystems. Indeed, tourism investments following a disaster may become a sideshow to the disaster that shifts attention from the disaster to participation in new economic opportunities. In addition, tourism may represent ecological alterations, which are more subtle, yet as damaging, as an oil disaster. The proposed model is then applied to two additional cases, the Exxon Valdez oil spill and Hurricane Katrina, to test its use in understanding other postdisaster developments.	1	Patricia Widener
Alkon, Alison & Kari Norgaard. 2009. 'Breaking the Food Chains: an Investigation of Food Justice Activism.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:3 289-305.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	10	This article develops the concept of food justice, which places access to healthy, affordable, culturally appropriate food in the contexts of institutional racism, racial formation, and racialized geographies. Through comparative ethnographic case studies, we analyze the demands for food justice articulated by the Karuk Tribe of California and the West Oakland Food Collaborative. Activists in these communities use an environmental justice frame to address access to healthy food, advocating for a local food system in West Oakland, and for the demolition of Klamath River dams that prevent subsistence fishing. Food justice serves as a theoretical and political bridge between scholarship and activism on sustainable agriculture, food insecurity, and environmental justice. This concept brings the environmental justice emphasis on racially stratified access to environmental benefits to bear on the sustainable agriculture movement's attention to the processes of food production and consumption. Furthermore, we argue that the concept of food justice can help the environmental justice movement move beyond several limitations of their frequent place-based approach and the sustainable agriculture movement to more meaningfully incorporate issues of equity and social justice. Additionally, food justice may help activists and policymakers working on food security to understand the institutionalized nature of denied access to healthy food.	2	Alison Hope Alkon; Kari Marie Norgaard
Hess, David. 2009. 'the Potentials and Limitations of Civil Society Research: Getting Undone Science Done.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:3 306-327.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	14	The term ``undone science'' refers to absences of scientific research that social movement and other civil society organizations find when attempting to make epistemic claims in the political field. The existing literature has identified various pathways for addressing the knowledge needs of civil society organizations, including asking elected and appointed political leaders to shift funding priorities and directly seeking support and partnerships with scientists. Here, a third pathway is identified and explored: civil society organizations that have the resources to fund their own research. A sample of such ``civil society research'' from large, mainstream, U.S. environmental organizations demonstrates that although the large organizations do engage in such research, most of it is not published in peer-reviewed journals. The peer-reviewed research is found almost exclusively in large preservation and conservation organizations that have staffs of scientists. Most of the other research reports are oriented toward documenting environmental problems and providing policy and management solutions. The research is highly applied and does not represent fundamental contributions to large mainstream scientific fields. Comparisons with civil society research in the author's previous research projects on religion, health, and economic development are discussed to assess applicability of the concept for other sociological subfields.	1	David J.

Crowley, Jocelyn. 2009. 'Conflicted Membership: Women in Fathers' Rights Groups.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:3 328-350.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	2	Women who participate in mixed-gender, antifeminist movements are not a homogeneous group of actors who face no identity-based conflicts when they mobilize for these causes. Using 23 in-depth interviews with women involved in the American fathers' rights movement-which has as its goal the reformation of child support and child custody laws in ways that are more favorable to men and less favorable to women-I argue that mixed-gender, antifeminist activism has the potential to produce high levels of tension for female participants between their various social identities and their collective movement identity. Indeed, almost half of these women elaborate on how two particular manifestations of their social identities-as simultaneous members of other feminist groups and simply as women-clash with the collective identity generated by the fathers' rights movement. Ultimately, these women coped with these competing allegiances in a variety of proactive ways. In contrast, the other half of the sample experienced no such tensions. These differential patterns of identity-based conflicts are suggestive of the hazards associated with a social movement's efforts to attract a wider membership base over time.	1	Jocelyn Elise Crowley
Zlatunich, Nichole. 2009. 'Prom Dreams and Prom Reality: Girls Negotiating ``perfection'' at the High School Prom.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:3 351-375.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	0	Adolescent girls are often assumed to be extremely vulnerable to media influences; however, this study argues that girls actually negotiate meaning from media texts. Content analysis of teen prom magazines is combined with ethnography to explore how magazine texts operate within their readers' worlds. This article argues against two commonly accepted dictates. First, I propose that popular magazines for adolescent girls are more complicated than previously acknowledged and do not rely on a singular message of perfection derived from beauty and heterosexual romance. And second, how girls engage with the magazines is more complicated than prior research has argued; girls use ``strategic selectivity'' (a term proposed to explain how girls make meaning of cultural texts) to negotiate the dominant meanings found in prom magazines and other cultural texts.	1	Nichole Zlatunich
Warren, John & Andrew Halpern-Manners. 2009. 'Graduation Rates at the State Level What Difference Does Methodology Make?.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 38:1 3-37.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	2	Recent evidence makes clear that states public high school graduation rates are well measured using information from the Common Core of Data (CCD). This article investigates the substantive consequences for the results of empirical analyses of using different CCD-based measures of states' public high school graduation rates. The authors show that substantive conclusions about the levels, correlates, and predictors of states' public high school graduation rates are dependent on how those rates are measured using the CCD data. Warren's (2005) estimated completion rate is the most conceptually and technically sound CCD-based measure, and that measure is improved in this study. The public high school graduation rate for the class of 2004 was about 76 percent, although that rate varied considerably by race/ethnicity and across states.	2	John Robert Warren; Andrew Halpern-Manners
Abell, Peter. 2009. 'a Case for Cases Comparative Narratives in Sociological Explanation.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 38:1 38-70.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	3	When case studies are constructed as narratives, then causal explanation can be achieved without either comparison or generalization. Narratives provide paths of causal links on a chronology of actions or events. The links, in turn, can be studied as Bayesian inferences generating Bayesian narratives. The causal paths in a narrative have a Boolean structure.	1	Peter Abell
Baumgartner, Michael. 2009. 'Inferring Causal Complexity.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 38:1 71-101.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	6	In The Comparative Method, Ragin (1987) outlined a procedure of Boolean causal reasoning operating on pure coincidence data that has since become widely known as qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) among social scientists. QCA-including its recent forms as presented in Ragin (2000, 2008)-is designed to analyze causal structures featuring no more than one effect and a possibly complex configuration of mutually independent direct causes of that effect. This article presents a procedure of causal reasoning that operates on the same type of empirical data as QCA and that implements Boolean techniques related to the ones resorted to by QCA. Yet in contrast to QCA, the procedure introduced here successfully identifies structures involving both multiple effects and mutually dependent causes. In this sense, this article generalizes QCA.	1	Michael Baumgartner
Eliason, Scott & Robin Stryker. 2009. 'Goodness-of-fit Tests and Descriptive Measures in Fuzzy-set Analysis.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 38:1 102-146.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	11	In this article the authors develop goodness-of-fit tests for fuzzy-set analyses to formally assess the fit between empirical information and various causal hypotheses while accounting for measurement error in membership scores. These goodness-of-fit tests, and the accompanying logic, provide a sound inferential foundation for fuzzy-set methodology. The authors also develop descriptive measures to complement these tests. Examples from Stryker and Eliason (2003) and Mahoney (2003) show how goodness-of-fit tests and descriptive measures may be used to assess individual causal factors as well as conjunctions of factors. The authors show how these tools provide more information in a fuzzy-set analysis than do tests currently in use. In providing this inferential foundation, the authors also show that fuzzy-set methods (a) are no less amenable to falsificationist methods of the Neyman-Pearson type than are standard statistical techniques and (b) may be usefully applied in either an exploratory/inductive or a confirmatory/deductive research design.	2	Scott R.

Weakliem, David & Bradley Wright. 2009. 'Robustness of Group-based Models for Longitudinal Count Data.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 38:1 147-170.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	1	In recent years, there have been efforts to develop latent class models for trajectories. The semiparametric mixed Poisson regression (SMPR) model has been used in many empirical studies, but there have been few attempts to evaluate the robustness of the estimates from this model. The authors use simulated data to evaluate the performance of the SMPR model under a variety of assumptions. They find that estimates are sensitive to the conditional distribution of counts and misspecification of the shape of the trajectory. When there is only one underlying trajectory and overdispersion is present, the SMPR model frequently finds multiple groups, which often appear to differ in shape as well as level. The tendency can be substantially reduced by use of the zero-inflated Poisson distribution in conjunction with top-coding of large counts. The article concludes with a discussion of other extensions and alternatives to the standard SMPR model that might provide more robust estimates.	2	David L. Weakliem; Bradley R. Wright

Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	5	The Displaced New Orleans Residents Pilot Study is designed to examine the current location, well-being, and plans of people who lived in the city of New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 29, 2005. The study is based on a representative sample of pre-Katrina dwellings in the city. Respondents were administered a short paper-and-pencil interview by mail, by telephone, or in person. The pilot study was fielded in the fall of 2006, approximately 1 year after Hurricane Katrina. This article describes the motivation for the pilot study, outlines its design, and describes the fieldwork results using a set of fieldwork outcome rates and multivariate logistic models. It ends with a discussion of the lessons learned from the pilot study for future studies of the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the population of New Orleans. The results point to the challenges and opportunities of studying this unique population.	1	Narayan Sastry
Gauthier, Jacques-Antoine, Eric Widmer, Philipp Bucher & Cedric Notredame. 2009. 'How Much Does It Cost? Optimization of Costs in Sequence Analysis of Social Science Data.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 38:1 197-231.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	7	One major methodological problem in analysis of sequence data is the determination of costs from which distances between sequences are derived. Although this problem is currently not optimally dealt with in the social sciences, it has some similarity with problems that have been solved in bioinformatics for three decades. In this article, the authors propose an optimization of substitution and deletion/insertion costs based on computational methods. The authors provide an empirical way of determining costs for cases, frequent in the social sciences, in which theory does not clearly promote one cost scheme over another. Using three distinct data sets, the authors tested the distances and cluster solutions produced by the new cost scheme in comparison with solutions based on cost schemes associated with other research strategies. The proposed method performs well compared with other cost-setting strategies, while it alleviates the justification problem of cost schemes.	4	Jacques-Antoine Gauthier; Eric D.

Work and Occupations. 36:3 181-208.	Work and Occupations	2009	8	Using large-scale data on immigrants in the Netherlands, the authors tested competing arguments about the role of origin- and host-country human capital and bonding and bridging social capital in immigrants' self-employment. When taking job-skill level into account, immigrants with a higher level of origin- and destination-country education are less likely to be self-employed than salary employed. Likewise, the likelihood of self-employment decreases with origin-country work experience but not with host-country work experience. The presumed positive effect of bonding social capital is not found, but this study's results suggest that immigrants with an access to bridging social capital are more likely to be self-employed than those without such contacts.	3	Agnieszka Kanas; Frank Tubergen; Tanja Lippe
Williams, Damian. 2009. 'Grounding the Regime of Precarious Employment Homeless Day Laborers' Negotiation of the Job Queue.' Work and Occupations. 36:3 209-246.	Work and Occupations	2009	4	This ethnography of day laboring contends that to better understand how the labor process situated within the industry is regulated at the micro-level, it is necessary to move beyond studies that limit their analyses of homeless day laborers-an important subset of workers who mediate and respond to this low-road industry's bottom line imperatives-to worker grievances or the strategies they use to combat anonymity. This article shows that the reasons homeless workers see day labor as a ``sensible'' income-generating strategy and the ways in which they comprehend and negotiate the job queue-the central, supply-side regulatory mechanism with which they contend each day-illuminate both the ways in which they coproduce the regime of work-place discipline that regulates the temporary-labor process and contribute to the reproduction of the industry's micro-foundations. By extending the concept of ``reliable contingency'' to include these supply-side processes, this analysis reveals that agency loyalty is produced by a divide-and-rule dynamic that emerges from and acts back on these interpretive and interactional dynamics, creating an informal regulatory structure embedded in the hiring hall.	1	Damian T.

American Journal of Sociology	2009	4	This article offers an innovative theoretical approach to black-white labor market inequality that combines components of threat, spatial mismatch, and urban decline theories in a queuing framework. Using a unique measure-the earnings gap between black and white workers resulting from sorting into different occupations within an occupationally and educationally delimited labor queue-the author tests hypotheses from the combined model. Results show support for the combined model, as characteristics of labor and job queues significantly influence the extent of black-white inequality. Variables representing employers' preferences for or against hiring black workers are also significant, suggesting the utility of jointly examining preferences and processes in the labor market.	1	Sabino Kornrich

The path-dependent models offered by fiscal-military, rational choice, and geopolitical theorists are evaluated in comparison with an elite conflict model of contingent historical change. The latter model is found to be better able to explain territorial and fiscal stagnation and decline as well as imperial expansion in the cases of early modern Spain, France, the Netherlands, and Britain.	1	Richard Lachmann
Papachristos, Andrew. 2009. 'Murder by Structure: Dominance Relations and the Social Structure of Gang Homicide.' American Journal of Sociology. 115:1 74-128.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	29	Most sociological theories consider murder an outcome of the differential distribution of individual, neighborhood, or social characteristics. And while such studies explain variation in aggregate homicide rates, they do not explain the social order of murder, that is, who kills whom, when, where, and for what reason. This article argues that gang murder is best understood not by searching for its individual determinants but by examining the social networks of action and reaction that create it. In short, the social structure of gang murder is defined by the manner in which social networks are constructed and by people's placement in them. The author uses a network approach and incident-level homicide records to recreate and analyze the structure of gang murders in Chicago. Findings demonstrate that individual murders between gangs create an institutionalized network of group conflict, net of any individual's participation or motive. Within this network, murders spread through an epidemic-like process of social contagion as gangs evaluate the highly visible actions of others in their local networks and negotiate dominance considerations that arise during violent incidents.	1	Andrew V.

American Journal of Sociology	2009	11	Humans transformed landscapes at an unprecedented scale and pace during the 20th century, creating sprawling urban areas in affluent countries and large-scale agricultural expanses in tropics. To date, attempts to explain these processes in other disciplines have had a disembodied, ahistorical quality to them. A sociological account of these changes emphasizes the role of strategic actions by states and coalitions of interested parties in transforming landscapes. It identifies the agents of change and the timing of transformative events. Case studies of suburban sprawl and tropical deforestation illustrate the value of the sociological approach and the wide range of situations to which it applies.	1	Thomas K. Rudel

American Journal of Sociology. 115:1 155-202.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	17	In the late 1990s, the British anti-genetic engineering (GE) movement effectively closed Britain's market for genetically modified foods, while the U. S. anti-GE movement had a negligible impact. In seeking to explain the different outcomes of these similar social movements, the authors draw upon the global commodity chains (GCC) literature to extend the understanding of the economic and industry-related openings and closures social movements face as they seek to promote social change. This analysis not only illustrates the importance of economic structures and organization for movement outcomes, but also shows how the economic sphere is culturally constituted. In this fashion, it broadens the social movement literature's understanding both of the way that political economy matters to movement efficacy and of the way that cultural processes infuse the economic sphere. The study advances the GCC literature by showing how GCCs are cultural as well as economic constructs.	2	Rachel Schurman; William Munro
Slater, Dan. 2009. 'Revolutions, Crackdowns, and Quiescence: Communal Elites and Democratic Mobilization in Southeast Asia.' American Journal of Sociology. 115:1 203-254.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	16	Urban mass mobilization often stimulates the collapse of authoritarian regimes, but the literature on social forces in democratization has not dealt adequately with these episodes of popular protest. Nor has it systematically compared democratic revolutions with cases of authoritarian crackdown and chronic quiescence, despite the prevalence of these alternative outcomes. This article critiques the democratization literature's excessive focus on class actors and economic factors by highlighting the importance of emotive appeals to nationalist and religious sentiments and solidarities in sparking, sustaining, and sanctifying high-risk protest against authoritarian governments. A comparative historical analysis of seven Southeast Asian countries reveals that democratic uprisings are more likely both to emerge and to succeed when communal elites-a society's primary possessors of nationalist and religious authority-assume an oppositional posture. Explaining variation in mobilization outcomes thus requires examining whether communal elites have gained political salience and retained political autonomy through long-term processes of political development.	1	Dan Slater

Social Networks	2009	23	This paper offers a structured overview of 50 years of small-world research. Initially formulated by Pool and Kochen in the mid-1950s, the small-world concept can be divided into six research foci, based on three dimensions (structural, process-related, psychological), and two process-related themes (diffusion, search). Building on this analytical distinction, the article provides a historical summary of the different phases of research on the small-world problem, and summarizes the empirical and theoretical progress on different facets of the small-world phenomenon. The paper concludes with a brief assessment of accomplishments and open questions, suggesting some possible future research areas.	1	Sebastian Schnettler

These studies, and a majority of variants conducted by others, display a number of methodological weaknesses that bias their results. While no explicit methodological standard exists for these studies, here I derive a number of best-practice criteria for small-world studies by pointing out mistakes of previous studies, and by applying methodological standards from other empirical research areas. Improving the methodology of letter referral studies is important, because such studies could still be useful in a number of contexts today, especially for the exploration of factors affecting targeted search processes.	1	Sebastian Schnettler
Kolaczyk, Eric, David Chua & Marc Barthelemy. 2009. 'Group Betweenness and Co-betweenness: Inter-related Notions of Coalition Centrality.' Social Networks. 31:3 190-203.	Social Networks	2009	8	Vertex betweenness centrality is a metric that seeks to quantify a sense of the importance of a vertex in a network in terms of its `control' on the flow of information along geodesic paths throughout the network. Two natural ways to extend vertex betweenness centrality to sets of vertices are (i) in terms of geodesic paths that pass through at least one of the vertices in the set, and (ii) in terms of geodesic paths that pass through all vertices in the set. The former was introduced by Everett and Borgatti [Everett, M., Borgatti, S., 1999. The centrality of groups and classes. journal of Mathematical Sociology 23 (3), 181-201], and called group betweenness centrality. The latter, which we call co-betweenness centrality here, has not been considered formally in the literature until now, to the best of our knowledge. In this paper, we show that these two notions of centrality are in fact intimately related and, furthermore, that this relationship may be exploited to obtain deeper insight into both. In particular, we provide an expansion for group betweenness in terms of increasingly higher orders of co-betweenness, in a manner analogous to the Taylor series expansion of a mathematical function in calculus. We then demonstrate the utility of this expansion by using it to construct analytic lower and upper bounds for group betweenness that involve only simple combinations of (i) the betweenness of individual vertices in the group, and (ii) the co-betweenness of pairs of these vertices. Accordingly, we argue that the latter quantity, i.e., pairwise co-betweenness, is itself a fundamental quantity of some independent interest, and we present a computationally efficient algorithm for its calculation, which extends the algorithm of Brandes [ Brandes, U., 2001. A faster algorithm for betweenness centrality. journal of Mathematical Sociology 25,1631 in a natural manner. Applications are provided throughout, using a handful of different communication networks, which serve to illustrate the way in which our mathematical contributions allow for insight to be gained into the interaction of network structure, coalitions, and information flow in social networks.	3	Eric D.

Social Networks. 31:3 204-213.	Social Networks	2009	14	Social network data often involve transitivity, homophily on observed attributes, community structure, and heterogeneity of actor degrees. We propose a latent cluster random effects model to represent all of these features, and we develop Bayesian inference for it. The model is applicable to both binary and non-binary network data. We illustrate the model using two real datasets: liking between monks and coreaderships between Slovenian publications. We also apply it to two simulated network datasets with very different network structure but the same highly skewed degree sequence generated from a preferential attachment process. One has transitivity and community structure while the other does not. Models based solely on degree distributions. such as scale-free, preferential attachment and power-law models, cannot distinguish between these very different situations, but the latent cluster random effects model does.	4	Pavel N.

Sinclair, Philip. 2009. 'Network Centralization With the Gil Schmidt Power Centrality Index.' Social Networks. 31:3 214-219.	Social Networks	2009	3	Network centralization is a network index that measures the degree of dispersion of all node centrality scores in a network from the maximum centrality score obtained in the network.

Upper bounds for network centralization, using the Gil Schmidt power centrality index, are derived for networks of fixed order and for when the network is bipartite, such as can arise from two mode data. In each case the networks that have maximum network centralization are described.	1	Philip Andrew Sinclair

It also addresses the effects of national linkages to the international human rights regime. The results reveal that adoption rates are positively influenced by stronger national links to the human rights regime throughout the period and that various measures of the density of global society influence adoption, particularly after the institutionalization of human rights. Finally, the results demonstrate that democratic countries and nations with more expanded educational systems tend to adopt a UNESCO school before the period of human rights institutionalization. The implications of these findings are discussed in relation to the literature on the global environment and the diffusion of innovations in education.	3	David F. Suarez; Francisco O.

Van, Mieke & Peter Stevens. 2009. 'School Ethnic Composition and Students' Integration Outside and Inside Schools in Belgium.' Sociology of Education. 82:3 217-239.	Sociology of Education	2009	15	To advance social integration, policy makers strive for the educational desegregation of immigrant students in Flemish schools. Given the lack of empirical research supporting this policy, this article examines the association between the ethnic composition of schools and native and immigrant students' interethnic friendships, social participation, and sense of belonging in school. Blau's structural theory offers the theoretical rationale for these associations and the coherence of the three indicators. Multilevel analyses of data from a 2004-05 survey of 11,872 students, 1,324 of whom were immigrant students, in a sample of 85 Flemish secondary schools demonstrate that school ethnic composition is associated with interethnic friendships and social participation for native students, but not for immigrant students, whereas socioeconomic status is decisive for immigrant students' interethnic friendships. Neither immigrants' nor natives' sense of belonging in school is associated with ethnic composition. Hence, while the findings do not provide support for either school segregation or desegregation policies aimed at improving the social integration of immigrant students, mixing schools appears to have a positive influence on the social integration of Flemish youths. The consequences of these findings for future research and social policy are discussed in the conclusions.	2	Mieke Van; Peter A. Stevens
Oropesa, R. & Nancy Landale. 2009. 'Why Do Immigrant Youths Who Never Enroll in Us Schools Matter? School Enrollment Among Mexicans and Non-hispanic Whites.' Sociology of Education. 82:3 240-266.	Sociology of Education	2009	10	Using data from the 2000 Public Use Sample of the U.S. census, this research examined how estimates of school enrollment and school-work patterns among Mexican-origin adolescents are affected by including or excluding young immigrants who never enrolled in U.S. schools. The analysis demonstrates that a nontrivial share of adolescents who were born in Mexico almost certainly never enrolled in U.S. schools; these youths most likely migrated to the United States for work. Excluding these adolescents from analyses substantially reduces gaps in school enrollment between Mexicans and whites and between native and foreign-born Mexicans. Excluding never-enrolled immigrant youths also changes the relationship between the duration of U.S. residence and idleness among Mexican immigrant youths, revealing that additional years of residence in the United States increase the likelihood of being out of school and not working compared to being in school and not working. Overall, inferences about the level of school enrollment and intraethnic differences in school enrollment by duration of residence depend on how those who are likely to have never enrolled in U.S. schools are treated. Inferences about interethnic differences are also affected, although they are somewhat less sensitive to this issue.	2	R. S. Oropesa; Nancy S. Landale
Morgan, Stephen & Jennifer Todd. 2009. 'Intergenerational Closure and Academic Achievement in High School: a New Evaluation of Coleman's Conjecture.' Sociology of Education. 82:3 267-285.	Sociology of Education	2009	9	This article reexamines the conjecture of James S. Coleman that intergenerational social closure promotes student achievement in high schools, analyzing the best national data on academic achievement and social networks: the 2002 and 2004 waves of the Education Longitudinal Study. The results show that within the Catholic school sector, schools that are characterized by dense parental networks have substantially higher average student achievement. This association can be reduced but not eliminated by conditioning on available measures of student network structure and standard measures of family background. In contrast, in the public school sector, a similarly strong bivariate association between dense parental networks and student achievement can be attributed almost entirely to these basic conditioning variables. These results represent, at best, a mixed verdict for Coleman's predictions. Intergenerational closure in its currently observed form does not increase achievement in public schools, suggesting that parental monitoring of discipline does not outweigh some of the costs of parental closure. However, intergenerational closure may increase achievement in Catholic schools to a modest degree because Catholic schools are affiliated with religious communities that have appropriable norms.	2	Stephen L.

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	6	This study is set against the backdrop of the evolving order of a health care system in a province implementing a set of concurrent reforms. The study investigates how `knowledge work' of multi-disciplinary health care teams is actually done and how it is co-ordinated across sites. Knowledge work involves three processes: the creation of new knowledge during the transfer of knowledge, in the context of the application of knowledge to their collective clinical decision-making. Institutional ethnography is used to explore the social and institutional forces that shape the knowledge work of health care providers in and across multi-disciplinary teams by way of examining how the texts trans-locally organise the formation and functioning of multi-disciplinary teams. The study confirms that in the course of their collective clinical decision-making, teams' dialogical exchange facilitates the articulation of tacit knowledge and opens up the communicative space for the creation of new knowledge. In addition to this confirmatory finding, the study contributes to the existing health-related knowledge management by illustrating the importance of the social, communicative aspects of the knowledge processes, and in particular, the relationship between knowledge and the social organisation of power.	1	Elizabeth Quinlan
Kirkpatrick, Ian, Peter Jespersen, Mike Dent & Indareth Neogy. 2009. 'Medicine and Management in a Comparative Perspective: the Case of Denmark and England.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:5 642-658.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	22	In health systems around the world the current trend has been for doctors to increase their participation in management. This has been taken to imply a common process of re-stratification with new divisions emerging between medical elites and the rank and file. However, our understanding of this change remains limited and it is open to question just how far one can generalise. In this paper we investigate this matter drawing on path dependency theory and ideas from the sociology of professions. Focusing on public management reforms in the hospital sectors of two European countries - Denmark and England - we note similarities in the timing and objectives of reforms, but also differences in the response of the medical profession. While in both countries new hybrid clinical management roles have been created, this process has advanced much further and has been more strongly supported by the medical profession in Denmark than in England. These findings suggest that processes of re-stratification are more path dependent than is frequently acknowledged. They also highlight the importance of national institutions that have shaped professional development and differences in the way reforms have been implemented in each country for explaining variation.	4	Ian Kirkpatrick; Peter Kragh Jespersen; Mike Dent; Indareth Neogy
McDonald, Ruth. 2009. 'Market Reforms in English Primary Medical Care: Medicine, Habitus and the Public Sphere.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:5 659-672.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	4	Drawing on interviews with English primary care doctors (GPs), this paper examines GP responses to reforms intended to introduce a market in primary health care. GPs' reactions are conceptualised in terms of a GP habitus, which takes for granted the superiority of `public' providers (i.e. GP partnerships) in the provision of care. GPs are actively involved in the defence of the public sphere, which is neither a neo-liberal minimalist market state, nor a wholly altruistic state, responding to consumers' wants. The public sphere they defend is one in which boundaries are drawn about entitlements and GPs are actively engaged in defining and policing these boundaries. The GP habitus can be seen as shaping responses in ways which serve GP interests. In the context of struggles involving various social actors (e.g. private providers, third-party payers, patients) with different stakes in the field of general medical practice; this public service orientation may enable GPs to reap cultural capital. At the same time, the habitus constrains action in a way which limits resistance to reforms threatening GPs' interests, with GPs responding by coping, rather than downing tools or engaging in active confrontation.	1	Ruth McDonald
Kivits, Joelle. 2009. 'Everyday Health and the Internet: a Mediated Health Perspective on Health Information Seeking.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:5 673-687.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	13	This paper explores the relationship between internet use and individuals' health experience. Adopting a `mediated health' approach, it presents four cases studies of households using the internet for health information. The study shows that participants use the internet as it offers personalised information in line with individuals' and families' health needs affecting their everyday routines. The internet emerges as an everyday helper linked to the intimacy of health experiences. Agency is manifest in study participants' choice of both becoming more informed as well as having the possibility of ignoring information. Case studies also show how personal internet use is confronted by informational surroundings generating flows of information that may induce uncertainty on the information seeker's side. The paper calls for a perspective which considers together personal health experience and media use to embed online health information seeking within an everyday context of internet use.	1	Joelle Kivits
Kontos, Pia & Gary Naglie. 2009. 'Tacit Knowledge of Caring and Embodied Selfhood.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:5 688-704.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	11	The tacit knowledge paradigm is gaining recognition as an important source of knowledge that informs clinical decision-making. It is, however, limited by an exclusive focus on knowledge acquired through clinical practice, and a consequent neglect of the primordial and socio-cultural significance of embodied selfhood, precisely what provides the foundational structure of tacit knowledge of caring and facilitates its manifestation. Drawing on findings from a qualitative study of 43 dementia care practitioners in Ontario, Canada that utilised research-based drama and focus group methodology, we argue that embodied selfhood is fundamental to tacit knowledge of caring. Results are analysed drawing upon the theoretical precepts of embodied selfhood that are rooted in Merleau-Ponty's (1962) reconceptualisation of perception and Bourdieu's (1977, 1990) notion of habitus. We conclude with a call for further exploration of the body as a site of the production of tacit knowledge.	2	Pia C. Kontos; Gary Naglie
Burr, Jennifer. 2009. 'Fear, Fascination and the Sperm Donor as `abjection' in Interviews With Heterosexual Recipients of Donor Insemination.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:5 705-718.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	10	The background to this article is the medical regulation of sperm donation in the UK and the recent policy change so that children born from sperm, eggs or embryos donated after April 2005 have the right to know their donor's identity. I draw upon data from interviews with ten women and seven joint interviews with couples who received donor insemination from an anonymous sperm donor and were the parents of donor insemination children. I explore the symbolic presence of the donor and his potential to disrupt social and physical boundaries using the theoretical conceptions of boundaries and pollution as articulated by Mary Douglas and Julia Kristeva. I present data to argue that the anonymous donor manifests in various figures; the shadowy and ambiguous figure of `another man'; the intelligent medical student; the donor as a family man, with children of his own who wants to help infertile men father children. In addition participants perceive the donor's physical characteristics, but also see their husband's physical characteristics, in their children. In conclusion I argue that anonymisation preserves features of conventional family life, maintains the idea of exclusivity within the heterosexual relationship and affirms the legal father's insecurity about his infertility.	1	Jennifer Burr
Baarts, Charlotte & Inge Pedersen. 2009. 'Derivative Benefits: Exploring the Body Through Complementary and Alternative Medicine.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:5 719-733.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	9	Since the 1960s, in Western societies, there has been a striking growth of consumer interest in complementary or alternative medicine (CAM). In order to make this increased popularity intelligible this paper challenges stereotypical images of users' motives and the results of clinical studies of CAM by exploring bodily experiences of acupuncture, reflexology treatments, and mindfulness training. The study draws on 138 in-depth interviews with 46 clients, client diaries and observations of 92 clinical treatments in order to identify bodily experiences of health and care: experiences that are contested between forces of mastery, control and resistance. We discuss why clients continue to use CAM even when the treatments do not help or even after they have been relieved of their physiological or mental problems. The encounter between the client and CAM produces derivative benefits such as a fresh and sustained sense of bodily responsibility that induces new health practices.	2	Charlotte Baarts; Inge Kryger Pedersen
Keeley, Bethany, Lanelle Wright & Celeste Condit. 2009. 'Functions of Health Fatalism: Fatalistic Talk as Face Saving, Uncertainty Management, Stress Relief and Sense Making.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:5 734-747.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	12	Much research on fatalism assumes that fatalistic statements represent a global outlook that conflicts with belief in the efficacy of health behaviours. Other scholars have suggested a more contextual approach, suggesting that fatalism fulfils personal and social functions. This study analyses 96 in-depth lay interviews in the US, most with low-income members of the general public, about four diseases: heart disease, lung cancer, diabetes and depression. Within these interviews, fatalistic statements always occurred alongside statements endorsing the utility of behaviours for protecting health. This usage pattern suggests that these statements may have useful functions, rather than being simply a repudiation of the utility of health choices. We examine four functions that are suggested by previous researchers or by the participants' comments: stress relief, uncertainty management, sense making and (less strongly) face saving. As these themes indicate, individuals often make fatalistic statements to express an understanding of locally or broadly limiting factors for health efficacy, including genes, spiritual agents, prior behaviours, personality, and other factors.	3	Bethany Keeley; Lanelle Wright; Celeste M.

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	2	This paper examines older women's experiences and perceptions of sunbathing, sun avoidance, and suntanned appearances. Using data from in-depth interviews with 36 women aged 71 to 94, we elucidate the motivations behind the women's sunbathing practices. Specifically, we explore how the women responded to the health and appearance risks associated with exposure to and avoidance of ultraviolet radiation as well as extant feminine beauty norms. The majority of women put their experiences of sunbathing in an emergent historical context. Although most of the women suggested that suntanned appearances were indicative of health and beauty, sunbathers tended to downplay their health risks by distancing themselves from those they considered to be most at risk, namely tanning bed users and individuals who acquired overly dark suntans. Sunbathers also emphasised the benefits of sun exposure for adequate vitamin D absorption. In contrast, the women who did not suntan tended to have experienced negative health and appearance consequences from their past sunbathing practices. Thus, these women emphasised the importance of future health over immediate appearance dividends. We discuss our findings in relation to the extant research on suntanning and the literature pertaining to health, risk, and beauty work.	2	Laura Hurd Clarke; Alexandra Korotchenko
Blaxter, Mildred. 2009. 'the Case of the Vanishing Patient? Image and Experience.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:5 762-778.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	9	It has been argued that the new technologies of medicine privilege the image over the actual body and its experience, so that the patients themselves may `vanish' behind the images. A case study is used to explore this from the patient's point of view. What evidence is there that alienation or other dysfunctional effects can actually happen? In this example of the high-tech medicine of lung cancer treatment, it was demonstrable that the process of diagnosis was not only dependent on, but also in some ways distorted by, the reliance on technologies. It was not necessarily true, however, that the machines and the images themselves proved alienating to the patient, or produced a feeling of disembodiment. It was the system in which they were used, their translation into records and decisions, which was deeply alienating, with only lip-service paid to the principles of patient-centredness or the inclusion of the patient as a partner in decision making. Features of the contemporary British health service which seem to foster this are discussed.	1	Mildred Blaxter
Atkinson, Maxine, Alison Buck & Andrea Hunt. 2009. 'Sociology of the College Classroom: Applying Sociological Theory at the Classroom Level.' Teaching Sociology. 37:3 233-244.	Teaching Sociology	2009	1	Teaching Sociology's emphasis on the scholarship of teaching and learning has moved the field well beyond simple description of teaching methods. There is no doubt that the journal is more scholarly than in the past. Still, we do not take advantage of our rich theoretical disciplinary work. There is much to learn sociologically about the classroom and other sites of interaction between teachers and students. Our classrooms are social sites and our analysis of them can be of help to scholars both inside and outside the discipline. In this article, we propose a sensitizing concept, the sociology of the college classroom-the application of sociological theory and/or concepts to understand social phenomena that take place at the level of the classroom and other sites of faculty-student interaction. We situate the sociology of the college classroom as a subset of the scholarship of teaching and learning and the sociology of higher education, Sociology of the college classroom can be a place not only where research meets teaching, but it can also be a site where sociological theory meets pedagogical praxis.	3	Maxine P.

Preves, Sharon & Denise Stephenson. 2009. 'the Classroom as Stage: Impression Management in Collaborative Teaching.' Teaching Sociology. 37:3 245-256.	Teaching Sociology	2009	0	This article explores the social-psychological process of identity negotiation in collaborative teaching, using Erving Goffman's (1959) theoretical tradition of dramaturgy to analyze the classroom itself as a performance venue. A dramaturgical analysis of collaborative teaching is especially significant given this growing pedagogical trend because identity negotiation in team teaching has the potential to impact one's teaching, one's career, and students' learning. We demonstrate that despite the positive outcomes of collaborative teaching for both teachers and learners, building a successful team is a process that takes time, effective communication, risk taking, and trust. Most significantly, sustaining a clear definition of the situation in the classroom is a challenge when a teaching team is engaged in the ongoing negotiation of roles, power, and course structure-in front of students. We argue that making identity claims in a collaborative team teaching situation is both more challenging and rewarding than acting alone on the classroom stage.	2	Sharon Preves; Denise Stephenson
Miller, Andrea & Betsy Lucal. 2009. 'the Pedagogy of (in)visibility: Two Accounts of Teaching About Sex, Gender, and Sexuality.' Teaching Sociology. 37:3 257-268.	Teaching Sociology	2009	2	As teachers who use both our theoretical (academic) and practical (empirical) knowledge to entice our students to peer outside of the seemingly clear-cut boxes of the two-and-only-two dichotomies of sex, gender, and sexuality, we attempt to problematize not only sexuality categories but also gender categories (specifically, the category ``woman''). While ``coming out'' complicates heterosexuality, it does little to question how non-normative sexual identities continue to be rendered and re-negotiated once sexual identity claims are made or are perceived to have been made. Moreover, as teachers concerned with gendered identities, we find it imperative in both our classroom and other academic settings to make the connection between gendered identities and sexual(ized) identities. For example, if a feminine woman who is married to a man comes out as bisexual, she may disrupt students' assumptions about the lives of bisexual people. The pedagogical effects of such a performance of bisexuality are clear: students can rethink their assumptions about bisexuality. However, if a masculine woman comes out as a lesbian, she may reinforce students' assumptions about the lives of lesbians. The pedagogical effects, therefore, are less clear. These experiences have forced us to rethink how we might continue to eradicate gender and sexuality inequality in the classroom. This has meant that we must deal with the social fact that our bodies embody (in)visibility politics whether we decide to ``come-out'' to our students and colleagues or if we are intent on ``keeping them guessing.''	2	Andrea Miller; Betsy Lucal

Teaching Sociology	2009	1	Unintended outcomes can derail the best of intentions in the classroom. Designing a new course for Honors students provided an opportunity to change my traditional teaching style. I envisioned a classroom where students enthusiastically became more self-directed learners. I was perplexed with mixed reactions from students; while some joined me and adopted the model of teaching and learning I proposed, far more than I expected resisted this change. Using a sociological framework helped me understand that I had overlooked the powerful influence of the larger institutional context for shaping and maintaining expectations for teacher/student role enactment. I argue that when students' comfort is disrupted and their normative role expectations are rendered unpredictable or misunderstood, some respond with resistance. Honors students, in particular, may be the most resistant to pedagogical innovation because they are the most skilled at, and invested in, enacting and maintaining the institutionally normative roles.	1	Cheryl Albers

Four of these beliefs include: (a) harm is direct, extreme, and the product of an individual's intentions; (2) harm is the product of the psyche; (3) for harm to occur, there must be an individual to blame; (4) beliefs and practices that students cherish or enjoy cannot be harmful. We offer sociological ideas that counter students' individualistic understanding of social harm.	2	Sherryl Kleinman; Martha Copp

Bandelj, Nina. 2009. 'Emotions in Economic Action and Interaction.' Theory and Society. 38:4 347-366.	Theory and Society	2009	8	How do emotions influence economic action? Current literature recognizes the importance of emotions for economy because they either help individuals perform economic roles through emotion management or enhancement of emotional intelligence, or because they aid rationality through their influence on preference formation. All these strands of research investigate the link between emotions and economy from an atomistic/individualistic perspective. I argue for a different approach, one that adopts a relational perspective, focuses on emotional embeddedness and examines how emotions matter in economic interactions. Emotional embeddedness research starts with a premise that emotions result from and are influenced by interactions between economic actors during the economic process where emotional currents and their visceral and physical manifestations come to the fore. This increases the uncertainty in economic transactions and complicates the given means-ends logic of rational economic decision making, yielding economic action principles different from utility maximization. I propose two types of such creative economic action in this paper: improvisation and situational adaptation. Improvisation characterizes situations where ends (goals) and means are unclear at the beginning of a transaction process and get articulated as a consequence of emotional embeddedness experienced during a process. Situational adaptation characterizes situations in which means or ends of action change because of interaction-induced emotions that prompt actors to choose new means/ends. The article concludes with a call for empirical research that explicates further the influence of emotions not merely for rational economic action but also creative economic interactions.	1	Nina Bandelj

Theory and Society	2009	13	Trust is understood in terms of a) acceptance of dependency in b) the absence of information about the other's reliability in order to c) create an outcome otherwise unavailable. The first of these is the cost of trust; the second, the situation of uncertainty it faces and may overcome; the third, its purchase. This account permits: distinction between trust and similar relations with which it is frequently confused; discovery of the basis of trust in the emotional apprehension of confidence; and demonstration of the relationship between trust and both social capital and rationality, with counter-intuitive results.	1	Jack Barbalet
Pixley, Jocelyn. 2009. 'Time Orientations and Emotion-rules in Finance.' Theory and Society. 38:4 383-400.	Theory and Society	2009	4	This article explores how Anglo-American financial firms since the 1980s have operated and acted in an increasingly deregulated, risky, and uncertain arena. I look at these firms and their actions with a particular focus on ``temporality'' and requisite ``emotion-rules,'' where variations in emotion-rules correspond with organizational definitions of uncertainty. Firms impose specific emotion-rules, depending on national policies, official duties, and interpretations of each risk. In finance, caveat emptor (i.e., buyer or lender distrust) is an emotion-rule set in screening policies and data collection for credit risks and risks of fraud by personnel, and it gives rise to actual emotions. I argue that three time-orientations are significant in creating emotion-rules. If a past, present, or a long-term future is deployed to construct a future, that creates and frames an institution's attempts to manage uncertainty. Looking exclusively at Anglo-American corporate finance policies and strategies (often deemed the international ``one best way''), six modes of certainty constructions are presented. Each is assessed against the dispositions and emotional strategies required in highly-skilled careers, in specific organizational settings. The relative influence of individual perspectives, institutional rules and general typologies of social action is assessed and found to comprise one past view, three present views, and one future-oriented perspective towards the future. Implications are outlined for emotion-rules relevant to financial careers and office.	1	Jocelyn Pixley

Theory and Society	2009	2	The dichotomy between emotion and rationality has been one of the most enduring of sociological theory. This article attempts to bypass this dichotomy by examining how emotion and rationality are conjoined in the practice of the choice of a mate. We posit the fundamental role of culture in determining the nature of this intertwinement. We explore the culturally embedded intertwining of emotion and rationality through the notion of modal configuration. Modal configuration includes five key features: reflexivity, techniques, modal emphasis, modal overlap, and modal sequencing. We apply this framework to the topic of partner selection. Comparing primary and secondary sources on pre-modern partner selection and on internet dating, we show that emotion and rationality were intertwined in both periods but that what differs between them is precisely the emotion-rationality modality.	2	Eva Illouz; Shoshannah Finkelman
Goffman, Alice. 2009. 'on the Run: Wanted Men in a Philadelphia Ghetto.' American Sociological Review. 74:3 339-357.	American Sociological Review	2009	46	Although recent increases in imprisonment are concentrated in poor Black communities, we know little about how daily life within these neighborhoods is affected. Almost all ethnographic work in poor minority neighborhoods was written before the expansion of the criminal justice system, and the bulk of research on ``mass imprisonment'' relies on survey data, field experiments, or interviews, conceptualizing its impact in terms of current or former felons and their families. Drawing on six years of fieldwork in Philadelphia, this article shifts the focus from imprisonment and criminal records to the increase in policing and supervision in poor Black neighborhoods, and what this has meant for a growing status group of wanted people. For many young men, avoiding jail has become a daily preoccupation: they have warrants out for minor infractions, like failing to pay court fees or braking curfew, and will be detained if they are identified. Such threat of imprisonment transforms social relations by undermining already tenuous attachments to family, work, and community. But young men also rely on their precarious legal standing to explain failures that would have occurred anyway, while girlfriends and neighbors exploit their wanted status as an instrument of social control. I discuss the implications of my ethnographic observations relative to prior treatments of the poor and policing, and with regard to broader sociological questions about punishment and surveillance in the modern era.	1	Alice Goffman
Gross, Neil. 2009. 'a Pragmatist Theory of Social Mechanisms.' American Sociological Review. 74:3 358-379.	American Sociological Review	2009	67	Some sociologists have recently argued that a major aim of sociological inquiry is to identify the mechanisms by which cause and effect relationships in the social world come about. This article argues that existing accounts of social mechanisms are problematic because they rest on either inadequately developed or questionable understandings of social action. Building on an insight increasingly common among sociological theorists-that action should be conceptualized in terms of social practices-I mobilize ideas from the tradition of classical American pragmatism to develop a more adequate theory of mechanisms. I identify three kinds of analytical problems the theory is especially well poised to address and then lay out an agenda for future research.	1	Neil Gross
Young, Cristobal. 2009. 'Model Uncertainty in Sociological Research: an Application to Religion and Economic Growth.' American Sociological Review. 74:3 380-397.	American Sociological Review	2009	9	Model uncertainty is pervasive in quantitative research. Classical statistical theory assumes that only one (true) model is applied to a sample of data. In practice, however, researchers do not know which exact model specification is best. Modern computing power allows researchers to estimate a huge number of plausible models, yet only a few of these estimates are published. The result is a severe asymmetry of information between analyst and reader The applied modeling process produces a much wider range of estimates than is suggested by the usual standard errors or confidence intervals. I demonstrate this using the work of Barro and McCleary, on religion and economic growth. Small, sensible changes in their model specification produce large changes in the results: the results are inconsistent across time, and the instrumental variables strategy suffers from a weak instrument set. Also, the observed relationship between religiosity and economic growth does not hold in the West; it is largely a feature of Asian and African countries and of countries whose data is poor quality In short, empirical findings should be evaluated not just by their significance but also by their robustness to model specification. I conclude with suggestions for incorporating model uncertainty into practice and improving the transparency of social science research.	1	Cristobal Young

American Sociological Review. 74:3 398-422.	American Sociological Review	2009	25	We fare sanctions are financial penalties applied to individuals who fail to comply with welfare program rules. Their widespread tee reflects a turn toward disciplinary approaches to poverty management. In this article, we investigate how implicit racial biases and discrediting social markers interact to shape officials' decisions to impose sanctions. We present experimental evidence based on hypothetical vignettes that case managers are more likely to recommend sanctions for Latina and black clients-but not white clients-when discrediting markers are present. We triangulate these findings with analyses of state administrative data. Our results for Latinas are mixed, but we find consistent evidence that the probability of a sanction rises significantly when a discrediting marker (i.e., a prior sanction for noncompliance) is attached to a black rather than a white welfare client. Overall, our study clarifies how racial minorities, especially, African Americans, are more likely to be punished for deviant behavior in the new world of disciplinary we fare provision.	4	Sanford E.

Van, Jennifer & Frank Bean. 2009. 'Explaining Mexican-immigrant Welfare Behaviors: the Importance of Employment-related Cultural Repertoires.' American Sociological Review. 74:3 423-444.	American Sociological Review	2009	10	Social scientists generally seek to explain welfare-related behaviors in terms of economic, social structural, or culture of poverty theories. Such explanations, however do not for account for nativity differences in public assistance receipt among immigrants of Mexican origin. This article draws on the sociology of migration and culture literatures to develop a materialist-based cultural repertoire account and attendant hypotheses to explain the welfare behaviors of Mexican immigrants. We argue that such immigrants arrive and work in the United States under circumstances that foster employment-based cultural repertoires that, compared with natives and other immigrant groups, encourage less welfare participation (in part because such repertoires lead to faster welfare exits) and more post-welfare employment. This is particularly true in states with relatively, more generous welfare policies. Using individual-level data predating the Welfare Reform Act, from, multiple panels of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) merged with state-level information on welfare benefit levels, we examine immigrant-group differences in welfare receipt, retention, and transition to employment across locales with varying levels welfare benefits. Findings are largely consistent with our cultural repertoire account: Mexican immigrants tend to utilize welfare not primarily, to avoid work, cope with disadvantage, or perpetuate a culture of dependency, but rather to minimize the effects employment discontinuities. Such findings carry important theoretical and policy implications-implications we outline in our conclusion.	2	Jennifer Van; Frank D. Bean

The exact source v and Processes underlying adolescent socialization in disadvantaged neighborhoods, however: are largely unspecified and unelaborated. This article proposes that cross-cohort socialization by older neighborhood peers is one source of socialization for adolescent boys. Data from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey suggest that adolescents in disadvantaged neighborhoods are more likely to spend time with older individuals. I analyze qualitative interview data from 60 adolescent boys in three neighborhoods in Boston to understand the causes and consequences of these interactions and relationships. Some of the strategies these adolescents employ to cope with violence in disadvantaged neighborhoods promote interaction with older peers, particularly, those who are most disadvantaged. Furthermore, such interactions can expose adolescents to local, unconventional, or alternative cultural models.	1	David J. Harding

American Sociological Review	2009	5	This study takes a life-course approach to examine whether family, and religious characteristics influence individual-level delinquency, trajectories from early adolescence through young adulthood. Based oil data from the NLSY79, results suggest that residing with two parents deters youths from becoming delinquent and that supportive parenting practices reduce their likelihood of becoming involved in delinquent behavior early in adolescence. There is also evidence that family, and religion interact to predict delinquency trajectories. Religion enhances the effect of parental affection in deterring delinquent behavior and mitigates the increased risk of high levels of delinquent behavior among youths in single-parent families. Moreover the findings indicate that delinquency trajectories are not immutable; family transitions are associated with increases in delinquency, bill religious participation throughout adolescence and marriage are associated with declines in delinquent behavior Overall, results suggest that family and religious characteristics continually influence the event to which youths commit delinquent acts.	1	Richard J.

Kirk, David. 2009. 'a Natural Experiment on Residential Change and Recidivism: Lessons From Hurricane Katrina.' American Sociological Review. 74:3 484-505.	American Sociological Review	2009	13	Ex-prisoners tend to be geographically concentrated in a relatively small number of neighborhoods within the most resource deprived sections of metropolitan areas. Furthermore, many prisoners return ``home'' to the same criminogenic environment with the same criminal opportunities and criminal peers that proved so detrimental prior to incarceration. Yet estimating the causal impact of place of residence on the likelihood of recidivism is complicated by the issue of selection bias. In this study, I use a natural experiment as a means of addressing the selection issue and examine whether the migration of ex-prisoners away from their former place of residence will lead to lower levels of recidivism. In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina ravaged the Louisiana Gulf Coast, damaging many of the neighborhoods where ex-prisoners typically reside. The residential destruction resulting from Hurricane Katrina is an exogenous source of variation that influences where a parolee will reside upon release from prison. Findings reveal that moving away from former geographic areas substantially lowers a parolee likelihood of re-incarceration.	1	David S. Kirk
Warren, Mark. 2009. 'Community Organizing in Britain: the Political Engagement of Faith-based Social Capital.' City \& Community. 8:2 99-127.	City \& Community	2009	3	Faith-based community organizing in the United States has emerged as one of the most effective ways to rebuild democratic life in urban communities. Scholars have argued that the success of modern community organizing lies in its ability to engage the social capital embedded in religious congregations. I examine this claim through a comparatively set case study of the effort to apply an American community organizing strategy in Britain. Using interviews, observations, and documentary sources, I analyze the experience of the British Citizens Organizing Foundation (COF), which is affiliated to the U.S.-based Industrial Areas Foundation. I find that the COF has attained more national influence than its American counterpart, but its local foundations remain much weaker. The relative weakness of faith-based social capital in Britain only partly explains this result. The orientations of religious institutions toward political engagement also matter, and so does the relative power of local versus national political institutions. I argue for bringing a more institutional approach to our theoretical understanding of community organizing and of the role of social capital in revitalizing democratic life more broadly.	1	Mark R.

Vallejo, Jody. 2009. 'Latina Spaces: Middle-class Ethnic Capital and Professional Associations in the Latino Community.' City \& Community. 8:2 129-154.	City \& Community	2009	5	This article examines the incorporation of middle-class Latinas in Southern California. Based on three years of participant observation, 30 in-depth interviews, and 50 conversational interviews with the organization's members, I find that the upwardly mobile Latinas mobilize ``middle-class ethnic capital'' to create professional associations in ethnic communities that provide valuable business skills, networks, and social capital to coethnics. Members of the organization realize that they must approximate the normative business standards of white middle-class business culture to get ahead, yet they feel that it is vital to retain their ethnic identity and provide resources to the ethnic community. While contemporary immigration research maintains the Latino ethnic communities lack the ``high-quality resources'' that might buffer against downward assimilation and advance upward mobility, these findings suggest that it takes one or two extra generations for Latinos to mobilize class and ethnic resources to promote mobility.	1	Jody Agius Vallejo
Holliday, Amy & Rachel Dwyer. 2009. 'Suburban Neighborhood Poverty in Us Metropolitan Areas in 2000.' City \& Community. 8:2 155-176.	City \& Community	2009	6	Suburban areas have become more diverse and stratified in the United States, with a particularly striking increase in poverty, challenging theories that conceptualize poverty predominantly as a central city phenomenon. Little scholarly work has examined suburban poverty, however, and the small existing literature focuses primarily on inner-ring suburbs in the Northeast and Midwest and relies too much on the concentric zone model of metropolitan development. We use Census 2000 summary data to examine the prevalence and form, characteristics, and determinants of suburban poverty at the neighborhood and metropolitan levels across the entire country. We draw on more sophisticated ecological and place stratification perspectives and argue that suburban poverty manifests in more varied forms than the typical model and diverges in crucial respects from central city poverty. Our results identify a particularly distinctive racial profile for suburban poverty, associated especially with Hispanic residential location, with implications for trends in racial segregation as well.	2	Amy L.

City \& Community	2009	1	This article, by examining the planning, development, construction, and operation of the Hiawatha light-rail transit line in the Twin Cities of Minnesota, attempts to further the understanding of coalition-building between lawmakers in urban and suburban areas, as well as those at the local, state, and federal levels, and how this cooperation affects metropolitan areas. The analysis relies on primary and secondary data from local newspapers, radio transcripts, and organization websites and materials from 1995 to 2007 to examine the political processes surrounding the project. Previous research on coalition-building strategies and regionalism informs the theoretical approach of the article. Key findings suggest that traffic congestion acts as a powerful motivator for uniting urban and suburban interests. The research also supports previous findings that big-city mayors seldom take the lead in promoting regional cooperation. In addition, findings suggest that governor-brokered coalitions can be relatively unstable, and that the possibility for receiving federal funds promotes regional cooperation along the lines of transportation issues.	1	Paul T.

Ethnography	2009	8	Ethnographers enter the field as legible signs of otherness to their interlocutors. In this article, I explore the ramifications of my personal experience of being variously `read' in the course of encounters in Bangkok, Thailand, to show how a gradual process of bodily inculcation can reduce the sense of difference and partially overcome the expectations induced by phenotype in particular, leading to greater access to the protected zones of cultural intimacy (including recognition of the newcomer's linguistic capacities). Such transitions also entail a learned increase of ease with informal modes of embodiment, as opposed to postures signaling varieties of power that are intrusive and palpably foreign to local experience. The processes of mutual recognition thus described are embedded in political relations of international as well as inter-personal significance. They thus have multi-faceted consequences for the outcomes and implications of our research.	1	Michael Herzfeld
Cohen, Einat. 2009. 'Survival, an Israeli Ju Jutsu School of Martial Arts Violence, Body, Practice and the National.' Ethnography. 10:2 153-183.	Ethnography	2009	4	Nationalism is the untenable union of the impersonal, mechanistic, bureaucratic logic of the state and the intimate, emotional, organic logic of the nation. While practicing martial arts, the participants at the Israeli Survival School of Ju Jutsu create a utopian Israeliness, using bits of state-national understandings to form a family-like organicity. At the North Indian school of wrestling described by Joseph Alter, too, an organic utopian nationalism is practiced into existence through meticulous care for the body itself. A comparison between those modes of embodying the national, set in very different cultural and national realities, reveals not only different understandings of the national and of its organic nature, but also different uses of semiotic mechanisms. Whereas the Israeli world of the Survival School is based on representation, the Indian one is constructed from the body and the environment, set in dense connectedness forming this world in and of itself.	1	Einat Bar-On Cohen
Adams, Jill. 2009. 'the Civil Restraining Order Application Process Textually Mediated Institutional Case Management.' Ethnography. 10:2 185-211.	Ethnography	2009	0	Although the civil restraining order is the most commonly sought legal initiative to combat intimate partner violence in British Columbia (BC), no known qualitative research has assessed the application process, and previous quantitative research presents mixed findings. Using interviews, observations, and textual analyses, this institutional ethnography critically analyzes the civil restraining order application process in the BC Provincial Court. Particular attention is paid to disjunctures between abused women's experiential knowledge and what becomes formally known to practitioners who manage their cases. Findings unveil that abused women's lived experience with violence is transformed and shaped into accounts in which their safety needs disappear. Court practitioners become immersed in textually mediated activity within a legal ruling apparatus that emphasizes timely completion of a large quantity of cases, with little or no commitment to quality solutions.	1	Jill Adams
Carter, Katherine & Judy Aulette. 2009. 'Creole in Cape Verde Language, Identity and Power.' Ethnography. 10:2 213-236.	Ethnography	2009	0	Cape Verde is an island country 450 kilometers off the coast of Senegal, West Africa. Creole is the common language throughout Cape Verde but Portuguese is the official language, the language of its colonizer. Through surveys and interviews, this article reveals the power inequalities that exist among Cape Verdeans because of language use. We particularly explore the perceptions of the significance of speaking Creole in order to fully understand the culture of Cape Verde. As a way to investigate the importance of Creole to Cape Verdean identity, we focus on the use of Creole proverbs and sayings by the women in Cape Verde as they express solidarity, provide support, and show criticism of power structures in the society. Through their use of Creole, Cape Verdeans are preserving their history and local identity as different from their colonizers as well as using the language and the proverbs as ways to challenge the dominant contemporary power structures.	2	Katherine Carter; Judy Aulette
Wade, Lisa. 2009. 'Defining Gendered Oppression in Us Newspapers the Strategic Value of ``female Genital Mutilation''.' Gender \& Society. 23:3 293-314.	Gender \& Society	2009	6	According to the logic of the gendered modernity/tradition binary, women in traditional societies are oppressed and women in modern societies liberated. While the binary valorizes modern women, it potentially erases gendered oppression in the West and undermines feminist movements on behalf of Western women. Using U. S. newspaper text, I ask whether female genital cutting (FGC) is used to define women in modern societies as liberated. I find that speakers use FGC to both uphold and challenge the gendered modernity/tradition binary. Speakers use FGC to denigrate non-Western cultures and trivialize the oppressions that U. S. women typically encounter, but also to make feminist arguments on behalf of women everywhere. I argue that in addition to examining how culturally imperialist logics are reproduced, theorists interested in feminist postcolonialism should turn to the distribution of such logics, emphasizing the who, where, when, and how of reinscription of and resistance to such narratives.	1	Lisa Wade
Martin, Karin & Emily Kazyak. 2009. 'Hetero-romantic Love and Heterosexiness in Children's G-rated Films.' Gender \& Society. 23:3 315-336.	Gender \& Society	2009	7	In this article, the authors examine accounts of heterosexuality in media for children. The authors analyze all the G-rated films grossing \$100 million dollars or more between 1990 and 2005 and find two main accounts of heterosexuality. First, heterosexuality is constructed through hetero-romantic love relationships as exceptional, powerful, magical, and transformative. Second, heterosexuality outside of relationships is constructed through portrayals of men gazing desirously at women's bodies. Both of these findings have implications for our understanding of heteronormativity. The first is seemingly at odds with theories that claim that heterosexuality's mundane, assumed, everyday ordinariness lends heteronormativity its power. In fact, the authors suggest heterosexual exceptionalism may extend the pervasiveness of heterosexuality and serve as a means of inviting investment in it. The second offers ways to begin to think about how heteronormativity is gendered and racialized.	2	Karin A. Martin; Emily Kazyak
Guenther, Katja. 2009. 'the Impact of Emotional Opportunities on the Emotion Cultures of Feminist Organizations.' Gender \& Society. 23:3 337-362.	Gender \& Society	2009	3	A fundamental debate within feminist scholarship and activism centers on what relationship feminism should have with the state. This article explores this debate empirically by examining differences in the emotion cultures of a state-dependent and an autonomous feminist organization in postsocialist eastern Germany. The comparative analysis demonstrates how organizations construct specific emotion cultures in response to emotional opportunities and constraints created by their relationships with state institutions. The state-dependent organization adopts a less expressive emotion culture that assures broad public appeal and future state support, but does not build critical consciousness among participants. In contrast, the autonomous organization encourages displays of feelings as part of consciousness raising, creating an emotion culture that reduces public appeal but produces especially loyal and active constituents.	1	Katja M.

Vespa, Jonathan. 2009. 'Gender Ideology Construction a Life Course and Intersectional Approach.' Gender \& Society. 23:3 363-387.	Gender \& Society	2009	9	Using life course and intersectional perspectives, this study examines how changes in life experiences such as marriage, parenthood, and work are associated with changes in individuals' gender ideology. Using longitudinal survey data and fixed effects, findings suggest that exposure to these experiences influences gender ideology, though with greater variation than previous work has detected. Marriage exerts an egalitarian influence on Blacks but a less egalitarian one on whites. Parenthood has a less egalitarian effect for all married parents but an egalitarian one for most unmarried parents. These findings suggest that gender ideology is dynamic and life experiences are important sources of change. Furthermore, this change depends on individuals' race-gender categories and the configuration of life events to which they are exposed. These nuanced findings amend past work by better identifying for whom and under which conditions life experiences shape gender ideology. In doing so, this study illustrates how the conceptual and methodological approaches help us understand gender ideology construction by revealing substantial variation that went undetected in past work.	1	Jonathan Vespa

Gender \& Society	2009	4	This study demonstrates the importance of social context to the study of networks vital to business success. Results from analyses of the personal and business characteristics associated with different types of networks, a topic that has been neglected in past research, show the importance of structural perspectives emphasizing that women and men in the same situations have similar networks. Yet there are some network differences even among these women and men who operate the same kinds of businesses. This suggests that insights from gender construction perspectives should be integrated into network and other gender inequality studies.	4	Karyn Loscocco; Shannon M. Monnat; Gwen Moore; Kirsten B.

Hao, Lingxin & Julie Kim. 2009. 'Immigration and the American Obesity Epidemic.' International Migration Review. 43:2 237-262.	International Migration Review	2009	5	Immigration is an important population dynamic at work in the U.S., but we know little about its impact on American obesity. Built on nutrition transition and immigration theories, this paper provides explanations for immigrants' initial body composition advantage, its partial erosion over time, and the gender difference in the erosion. We find evidence that the American obesity epidemic would be much more severe without the mass immigration that began in 1965. In addition to confirming the erosion in immigrants' body composition advantage, we further find that this erosion is weaker for men than for women. Once immigration's impact is teased out, racial/ethnic disparities in body composition greatly differ from what we observe. This study provides gender-specific estimates for the differences in obesity by nativity and residence duration and the net level of Hispanic-white and Asian-white disparities at the mean body mass index (BMI) as well as the overweight, Stage-1, and Stage-2 obesity cutoffs. Our findings suggest that immigration must be taken into account when addressing public health concerns.	2	Lingxin Hao; Julie J. Kim

We use a unique data set from a survey of foreign residents in the German states to study the roles played by factors such as attitudes towards foreigners and political interest of foreigners. We find that negative attitudes towards foreigners and generational conflict within foreigner families are significant negative factors. While interest in political participation is among the important positive factors, hostile attitudes, lack of voting rights, or uncertainty about staying in Germany mainly discourage foreigners who actively participate in the labor market, have more years of schooling, and are younger.	2	Martin Kahanec; Mehmet Serkan Tosun

The paper focuses on identifying the relationship between ongoing mobility patterns and personal and environmental circumstances, including institutional barriers to immigration and a discrete change in the social welfare eligibility of New Zealanders in Australia. The results confirm that ongoing migration patterns are far more complex than traditional migration paradigms suggest, with repeat and return migration and ongoing mobility being an important part of actual migration experiences.	1	Lynda Sanderson

Multiple regression models test the effect of access to co-ethnic social capital on the log earnings of refugees in their first and most recent years of work. Results show that over time access to co-ethnic social capital upon arrival decreased earnings for female refugees. The paper concludes with a discussion of the implications of the findings for social capital and immigration research.	1	Ryan Allen

International Migration Review	2009	6	Recent Canadian immigrants have increasing education levels but decreasing earnings, partly due to the devaluation of foreign education and work experience. This study uses 2002 Ethnic Diversity Survey data and examines the value attributed to foreign education for immigrants based on their duration of stay in Canada, which proves to be an important methodological distinction. Immigrants from developing countries experience the most acute devaluation. The findings outline the limitations of human capital theory in explaining the labor market experience of Canadian immigrants and have implications for the current ``point system'' used to select immigrants to Canada.	2	Raluca Buzdugan; Shiva S.

Boehlmark, Anders. 2009. 'Integration of Childhood Immigrants in the Short and Long Run - Swedish Evidence.' International Migration Review. 43:2 387-409.	International Migration Review	2009	1	Immigrant children are often at a disadvantage at school while they adjust to their new environment. It has been found that the age at immigration of 7 or above represents a sensitive period as regards these children's school performance for two main reasons: they have passed their prime age for language learning, and their acquisition of subject skills is less efficient while they learn to master the new language. Using Swedish administrative data, we track childhood immigrants born between 1972 and 1976 over time from adolescence (at 16) to adulthood (at 30), and study the role of age at immigration for educational and labor market outcomes. We find that immigration at a sensitive age (compared to a very young age) has a strong negative impact on compulsory school performance, but that the same individuals catch up strongly in terms of final educational attainment. In spite of this educational catching up, however, we find a considerable negative impact on earnings for men. We are able to rule out two potential mechanisms behind this puzzling result: It cannot be explained either by an impact on the chosen field of study or on completion time.	1	Anders Boehlmark

Three sources are explored, including federal immigration summaries, census microdata, and a sample of person-voyage records for steamship arrivals at the port of San Francisco (n = 5,707). Whereas parameter estimates vary among the sources from nearly twofold (gross migration) up to fourfold (net migration), all results are consistent with a revolving-door system in which young male workers arrived as replacements for departing older male workers.	3	Kenneth Chew; Mark Leach; John M.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	18	The fact that women are more religious than men is one of the most consistent findings in the sociology of religion. Miller and Stark (2002) propose that a gender difference in risk preference of physiological origin might explain this phenomenon. While acknowledging the utility of their risk-preference mechanism, we believe that their assumption regarding the genesis of this difference is a premature concession to biology. Returning to Miller's original paper on gender, risk, and religiosity, we draw on power-control theory (PCT), developed in the work of John Hagan and colleagues, to introduce a plausible socialization account for these differences. We evaluate these claims using data from the General Social Survey. Women raised by high-socioeconomic status (SES) mothers are less religious than women raised by low-education mothers, but mother's SES has little effect on men's chances of being irreligious and father's SES has a negligible effect on the gender difference in religiosity.	2	Jessica L.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	16	In light of increased scholarly and public discussion about the proper position of religion in higher education, we take stock of existing social scientific studies to illuminate what we know-and what we don't know-about religion and higher education. We argue that research shows that college students are more religiously engaged than has traditionally been thought, but that this interest appears to be more broad than deep; that the college experience does not lead to apostasy in most students, though its effect on students' religious engagements is still unclear; and that religion has a beneficial effect on some student outcomes, but not on others. We conclude by proposing three new directions for research that offer the potential to expand our understanding of the interaction of religion and higher education.	2	Damon Mayrl; Freeden Oeur
Ecklund, Elaine & Jerry Park. 2009. 'Conflict Between Religion and Science Among Academic Scientists?.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 48:2 276-292.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	9	Using new survey data (N = 1,646), we examine the attitudes academic scientists at 21 elite U.S. research universities have about the perceived conflict between religion and science. In contrast to public opinion and scholarly discourse, most scientists do not perceive a conflict between science and religion. Different from what other studies would indicate, this belief does not vary between social and natural scientists. We argue that maintaining plausibility frameworks for religion is an important correlate of whether scientists will reject the conflict paradigm, with such frameworks taking surprising forms. When scientists do not attend religious services they are more likely to accept the conflict paradigm. When scientists think their peers have a positive view of religion, they are less likely to agree there is a conflict between science and religion. Religious upbringing is associated with scientists adopting the conflict paradigm. Spirituality is much more important in this population than other research would lead us to believe. Results reformulate widely cited earlier research, offer new insights about how scientists view the connection between religion and science, and expand public discussion about religious challenges to science.	2	Elaine Howard Ecklund; Jerry Z.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 48:2 293-312.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	15	Religious doubt arises from a process in which there is a precipitant, the experience of doubt, a coping response, and a health-related outcome. We assess whether social factors precipitate doubt and the coping responses that are invoked to deal with doubt. We evaluate whether these coping responses are, in turn, associated with health. Over time, people who encounter more negative interaction with fellow congregants have more doubts about religion, whereas more spiritual support and greater involvement in prayer groups are associated with less religious doubt. People who encounter more negative interaction are more likely to suppress religious doubts, but people who attend Bible study groups are more likely to seek spiritual growth when faced with doubt. Suppressing religious doubt is associated with less favorable health, whereas seeking spiritual growth has no significant effect.	2	Neal Krause; Christopher G. Ellison

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	13	This study explores immigration reform as a possible new ``moral'' issue upon which American religious elites and organizations take public positions. It is argued that religion is a key independent variable necessary for understanding the determinants of public attitudes regarding immigration policy. Theoretical expectations are formed from the ethnoreligious, religious restructuralism, and minority marginalization frameworks. Quantitative evidence is presented, that demonstrates that those who attend religious services more frequently are more likely to support liberal immigration reform policies. Members of minority religions, notably Jews and Latter-day Saints, are also more likely to empathize with the plight of undocumented immigrants and support liberal immigration reform measures.	1	Benjamin R.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 48:2 332-352.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	1	At the end of the 19th century, British missionaries campaigned to abolish the India-to-China opium trade, whose profits were crucial for British ambitions in Asia. This challenge by the missionaries had been slow to emerge, however, and focusing only on that well-known opposition masks the preceding half-century of accommodations and compromises with the opium traffic, both on the production end (Bengal) and on the receiving end (in Macau and Canton). Our research addresses the subjective calculus that was at work for the missionaries and asks how their reading of that calculus affected their movement across the spectrum from unconcern to outrage about opium. At the core of their enterprise from beginning to end was their unwavering commitment to the evangelical ``Great Commission,'' which spelled out the obligation to bring the Christian gospel to unsaved multitudes around the world. We argue that they consistently embraced whatever was pragmatically necessary to advance that goal and resisted whatever threatened to block movement toward it. Beneath changeability on the surface, a thread of value-rational coherence ran through a century of calculated and strategic missionary activity. The same thread is likely to be in evidence in other theaters of global evangelism where missionaries were (are) involved in secular controversies.	2	Jon Miller; Gregory Stanczak

Methodological limitations and inconsistencies in previous studies have resulted in confusing and often contradictory findings. Using data from two waves of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 11,212), I compare the religious lives of young adults who attended Catholic, Protestant, and secular schools as adolescents. The results suggest that Protestant schoolers are far more religious as young adults than those who attended a secular school, a difference that is at least partially explained by the schools' religious environment. But young adults who attended Catholic schools report levels of religiosity that are similar to those educated in a secular school, and are actually lower for some outcomes. Studies of religious schoolers that ignore the religious tradition of the school overlook these differing effects and forfeit statistical explanatory power.	1	Jeremy E. Uecker

The results show that religious students were significantly more cooperative in the public goods game and significantly more generous in the dictator game than other students.	1	Ali M. Ahmed
Ruback, R., Neena Kohli & Janak Pandey. 2009. 'Hindus' Evaluations of Hindus and Muslims: Religious Leaders and Pilgrims at the Magh Mela.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 48:2 375-385.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	0	Two studies examined religious and political predictors of Hindus' attitudes toward Hindus and Muslims. In the first study, data came from interviews with 311 leaders of religious groups encamped at the Magh Mela, an annual religious gathering held at the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers in northern India. Results indicated that most of the indicators of religious involvement were positively related to favoritism of the ingroup (Hindus) rather than devaluation of the outgroup (Muslims). In contrast, affiliation with the Hindu-nationalist political party (Bharatiya Janata Party) was related to devaluation of Muslims rather than favoritism of Hindus. In the second study, which involved interviews with 107 kalpavasis (pilgrims) who visited a subsequent Mela, results indicated, consistent with the first study, that religious beliefs were positively related to favoritism of Hindus. A religious behavior, frequency of worship, was related to negative evaluations of Muslims. Overall, religious leaders and kalpavasis did not differ in their ratings of Muslims, but, congruent with the notion that the more strongly one identifies with the ingroup, the more impact it will have, religious leaders evaluated Hindus significantly more positively than did kalpavasis.	3	R.

This research examined whether intrinsic religious motivation combined with an experimental religious priming manipulation would predict decreased moral hypocrisy. A sample of Christian college students (N = 142) completed the Religious Orientation Scale-Revised, and the moral motivation paradigm, which tests whether participants will act in accordance with their moral beliefs at a cost to themselves. Half the participants received religious priming prior to the procedure. Intrinsic religiosity predicted decreased moral hypocrisy, but only when religiosity was primed. Findings support Allport's view of intrinsic religiosity, but with an emphasis on cognitive processes in addition to motivational ones.	2	Thomas P. Carpenter; Margaret A. Marshall

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	2	Interest in civil religion periodically resurfaces in the academic world with renewed force, reflected in new theoretical contributions and empirical studies. Due to its long history, this concept has been given different interpretations and has been related to other social phenomena. One of these is nationalism. Several theoreticians have sought to explain nationalism as a manifestation of ``civil religion'' in modern times. This article examines the relationship between (civil) religion and nationalism. A brief review of the ideas of the main authors who have theorized about this relationship is followed by a criticism of theories concerning civil religion and nationalism as the religion of modern times. I demonstrate the significant shortcomings of those theories from a three-fold perspective: definitional, theoretical, and empirical-methodological.	1	Jose Santiago

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	2	Recently, criminal justice professionals have advocated restorative justice as an alternative to traditional punitive practices. Extant research has not examined the strategic interpersonal dynamics between victims, offenders, supporters, and facilitators during restorative justice sessions. Our ethnographic study addresses this gap. Building on studies of emotion in reintegrative shaming, we explore how shaming emotions are dramaturgically mediated by the rhetorical use of victim roles. We suggest that this micropolitical shame management facilitates apparently meaningful outcomes, undermines them, or results in agreements based more on realpolitik than reintegration. Our data are derived from detailed field notes at 28 youth restorative justice sessions in a mid-sized Canadian city. Our findings reveal a different picture than the frequently idealized images of restorative justice, thus underscoring the need for further analysis in this important area of criminal justice.	2	J.

They find strong norms associated with control, mutuality, and deference to authority. Common sense interpretation rather than strict enforcement of rules prevails. To be enforced effectively, smoking policy would have to compete with other duties and elevate the security staff's perceived status in the eyes of visitors, staff, and patients.	7	Patrick B.

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	10	Building on existing literature and disparate field experiences, this article forwards a thesis that status group memberships such as gender are not destiny for building access and rapport during fieldwork. Rather, the female researcher is an active participant in how she is perceived and received by informants, capable of negotiating socially constructed scripts that dominate the field setting to her analytic advantage. Analysis demonstrates how field settings deem various combinations of a researcher's attributes relevant and how researchers can strategically utilize established scripts regarding these status group memberships to ethically gain the trust of informants. Our comparative case study design uses the concept of ``deploying gender'' to build this more general, intersectional thesis on the role of a researcher's status group memberships for gaining rapport.	2	Julie Mazzei; Erin E.

These exchanges are often viewed as one-dimensional relationships in which men use their access to crack cocaine and women's dependence on the drug to exploit them sexually. Drawing on in-depth interview data gathered during three years of research conducted in central Ohio, this article examines the relationship between sexual behavior and crack cocaine use from both male and female perspectives. Bourdieu's concept of fields is then applied to illuminate the relational dimensions of gender, sex, and power within this local crack-cocaine using scene, while also illustrating the domination inherent in most scenarios involving crack-for-sex exchange. Implications for possible interventions based on this analysis are also discussed.	2	Paul J. Draus; Robert G. Carlson

When immigrant parents choose a first name for their child that is common in their host society, they show a high degree of acculturation. In contrast, selecting a name common only in the parents' country of origin indicates ethnic maintenance. Using data from the German Socio-economic Panel for Turkish, Southwest European, and former Yugoslav immigrants, the authors show that acculturation in terms of name giving depends on several factors: the cultural boundary between the country of origin and the host society, the parents' sociostructural integration in terms of education and citizenship, interethnic networks, and religious affiliation.	2	Juergen Gerhards; Silke Hans
Abraham, Katharine, Sara Helms & Stanley Presser. 2009. 'How Social Processes Distort Measurement: the Impact of Survey Nonresponse on Estimates of Volunteer Work in the United States.' American Journal of Sociology. 114:4 1129-1165.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	18	The authors argue that both the large variability in survey estimates of volunteering and the fact that survey estimates do not show the secular decline common to other social capital measures are caused by the greater propensity of those who do volunteer work to respond to surveys. Analyses of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS) the sample for which is drawn from the Current Population Survey (CPS)-together with the CPS volunteering supplement show that CPS respondents who become ATUS respondents report much more volunteering in the CPS than those who become ATUS nonrespondents. This difference is replicated within subgroups. Consequently, conventional adjustments for nonresponse cannot correct the bias. Although nonresponse leads to estimates of volunteer activity that are too high, it generally does not affect inferences about the characteristics of volunteers.	3	Katharine G.

Hevenstone, Debra. 2009. 'Employment Intermediaries: a Model of Firm Incentives.' Journal of Mathematical Sociology. 33:1 1-37.	Journal of Mathematical Sociology	2009	0	This paper introduces a micro-simulation of job-worker matching with intermediaries (i.e., temp agencies). While many suggest that firms hire workers through intermediaries to save money on compensation, this paper finds that in a world of limited information and geographically limited job search, intermediaries' human resources ability could be a strong enough incentive, independent of compensation. The study also has some auxiliary findings showing that traditional fee structures encourage firms to use intermediaries for low-skill hires and that firms are more likely to use intermediaries when there is more worker heterogeneity. In the empirical analysis, it becomes clear that studies' estimates of indirect employment in the United States are inconsistent, partly because individuals are uncertain of their contractual status and their employer.	1	Debra Hevenstone
Denrell, Jerker & Zur Shapira. 2009. 'Performance Sampling and Bimodal Duration Dependence.' Journal of Mathematical Sociology. 33:1 38-63.	Journal of Mathematical Sociology	2009	0	Performance sampling models of duration dependence in employee turnover and firm exit predict that hazard rates will initially be low, gradually rise to a maximum, and then fall. Some empirical duration distributions have bimodal hazard rates, however. In this paper, we present a generalization of the performance sampling model that can account for such deviations from unimodality. While the standard model of performance sampling assumes that the mean and the standard deviation of performance are constant over time, we allow them to change in time, to reflect the fact that tasks may change over time. We derive the hazard rate implied by this more general model and show that it can be bimodal. Using data on turnover in law firms, we show that the hazard rate predicted by these models fit data better than existing models.	2	Jerker Denrell; Zur Shapira
Centola, Damon. 2009. 'Failure in Complex Social Networks.' Journal of Mathematical Sociology. 33:1 64-68.	Journal of Mathematical Sociology	2009	6	A class of inhomogenously wired networks called scale-free networks have been shown to be more robust against failure than more homogenously connected exponential networks. The robustness of scale-free networks consists in their ability to remain connected even when failure occurs. The diffusion of information and disease across a network only requires a single contact between nodes, making network connectivity the crucial determinant of whether or not these simple contagions will spread. However, for complex contagions, such as social movements, collective behaviors, and cultural and social norms, multiple reinforcing ties are needed to support the spread of a behavior diffusion. I show that scale-free networks are much less robust than exponential networks for the spread of complex contagions, which highlights the value of more homogenously distributed social networks for the robust transmission of collective behavior.	1	Damon Centola
Montgomery, James. 2009. 'Balance Theory With Incomplete Awareness.' Journal of Mathematical Sociology. 33:2 69-96.	Journal of Mathematical Sociology	2009	2	In this paper, we reformulate balance theory by allowing actors to possess incomplete awareness of the evaluations held by other actors, and by adopting balance closure (modified to allow incomplete awareness) as an equilibrium concept. Our treatment highlights psychological mechanisms, maintains a clear distinction between actors and objects, emphasizes the effects of self-awareness and self-evaluations of actors, and permits actors to hold ambivalent (simultaneously positive and negative) evaluations. Our analysis extends previous results linking the imbalance of a signed graph to ambivalence in its balance closure and reveals that an actor's indirect awareness of imbalance is necessary but not sufficient for that actor's ambivalence in the balance closure.	1	James D.

Dogan, Gonul & Marcel Assen. 2009. 'Testing Models of Pure Exchange.' Journal of Mathematical Sociology. 33:2 97-128.	Journal of Mathematical Sociology	2009	0	We reanalyze the experimental data of Michener et al. (1975, 1977) to explain behavior in pure exchange situations. The data were compared to predictions of various cooperative bargaining models and to the predictions of a bilateral exchange model developed in the present paper. The bilateral exchange model fitted well and performed best. The model could explain asymmetries in actors' exchange outcomes as commonly observed in exchange networks, and that generalized exchange hardly occurred in the experiments. However, systematic deviations from predictions of the bilateral exchange model and other models of rational behavior were observed; actors tend to focus on their absolute preferences rather than on their relative preferences. These deviations could be explained by a boundedly rational model of exchange, assuming that actors use heuristics to detect profitable exchange opportunities.	2	Gonul Dogan; Marcel Assen

The dynamics are followed in a space defined by variations in the proportion of positive links introduced and the tolerance to imbalance. The authors claim to have discovered boundaries in the space separating it into three distinct regions. One region probably displays the characteristics of self-organized criticality, which may have implications for the theory of extreme events.	2	Peter Abell; Mark Ludwig

Journal of Mathematical Sociology	2009	4	We introduce a new social utility function which relates inequity aversion to social status, effort, and ability. The basic idea is as follows: Actors do not suffer from inequality but from inequity relative to a fair share that reflects some normative orientation the actors have internalized. In this regard we advocate the rule of proportionality which states that rewards should be proportional to some standard of comparison. We apply this social utility function to various games from non-cooperative and cooperative game theory and interpret the results with respect to the effects of social status on behavioral outcomes.	2	Andreas Tutic; Ulf Liebe
Mrvar, Andrej & Patrick Doreian. 2009. 'Partitioning Signed Two-mode Networks.' Journal of Mathematical Sociology. 33:3 196-221.	Journal of Mathematical Sociology	2009	3	Structural balance theory forms the foundation for a generalized blockmodel method useful for delineating the structure of signed social one-mode networks for social actors (for example, people or nations). Heider's unit formation relation was dropped. We re-examine structural balance by formulating Heider's unit formation relations as signed two-mode data. Just as generalized blockmodeling has been extended to analyze two-mode unsigned data, we extend it to analyze signed two-mode network data and provide a formalization of the extension. The blockmodel structure for signed two-mode networks has positive and negative blocks, defined in terms of different partitions of rows and columns. These signed blocks can be located anywhere in the block model. We provide a motivating example and then use the new blockmodel type to delineate the voting patterns of the Supreme Court justices for all of their nonunanimous decisions for the 2006-07 term. Interpretations are presented together with a statement of further problems meriting attention for partitioning signed two-mode data.	2	Andrej Mrvar; Patrick Doreian

Menicucci, Domenico & Pier Sacco. 2009. 'Evolutionary Selection of Socially Sensitive Preferences in Random Matching Environments.' Journal of Mathematical Sociology. 33:4 241-276.	Journal of Mathematical Sociology	2009	1	In this paper we study the evolutionary selection of socially sensitive preferences in the context of reference interaction settings such as coordination failure and cooperation. We refer to a specific class of socially sensitive preferences in which players weigh additively their own material payoff against the opponent with either a positive or negative coefficient (-players). Preference evolution is guided by replicator dynamics in a context of perfect observability of preferences types and stochastic pairwise matching. We take an indirect evolutionary approach, that is, the selection mechanism operates on the actual material payoffs earned by players, so that any instance of socially sensitive preference can be thought of as instrumentally maintained. We find that the evolutionary viability of socially sensitive preferences basically depends on whether or not they cause a substantial improvement in the achievement of socially efficient outcomes with respect to the case where only self-serving or unconditionally focused preference orientations are observed. Our results suggest that moderate pro-social preference orientations are likely to emerge from social selection even in the absence of an intrinsic motivational drive, whereas extremely pro-social orientations as well as competitive and anti-social ones may need a stronger motivational base.	2	Domenico Menicucci; Pier Luigi Sacco
Bischi, Gian-Italo & Ugo Merlone. 2009. 'Global Dynamics in Binary Choice Models With Social Influence.' Journal of Mathematical Sociology. 33:4 277-302.	Journal of Mathematical Sociology	2009	8	A discrete-time dynamical system is proposed to model a class of binary choice games with externalities as those described by Schelling (1973, 1978). In order to analyze some oscillatory time patterns and problems of equilibrium selection that were not considered in the qualitative analysis given by Schelling, we introduce an explicit adjustment mechanism. We perform a global dynamic analysis that allows us to explain the transition toward nonconnected basins of attraction when several coexisting attractors are present. This gives a formal explanation of some overshooting effects in social systems and of the consequent cyclic behaviors qualitatively described in Schelling (1978). Moreover, we show how the occurrence of a global bifurcation may lead to the explanation of situations of path dependence and the creation of thresholds observed in real life situations of collective choices, leading to extreme forms of irreversible departure from an equilibrium and uncertainty about the long run evolution of the some social systems.	2	Gian-Italo Bischi; Ugo Merlone

Journal of Mathematical Sociology	2009	1	This study investigates the influence of resource inequality and the fairness of the allocation procedure of unequal resources on cooperative behavior in social dilemmas. We propose a simple formal behavioral model that incorporates conflicting selfish and social motivations. This model allows us to predict how inequality influences cooperative behavior. Allocation of resources is manipulated by three treatments that vary in terms of procedural justice: allocating resources randomly, based on merit, and based on ascription. As predicted, procedural justice influences cooperation significantly. Moreover, gender is found to be an important factor interacting with the association between procedural justice and cooperative behavior.	2	Ozan Aksoy; Jeroen Weesie

Current Perspectives in Social Theory	2009	1	This paper endeavours to translate Peirce's ideas into paradigmatic sociological theory in general, and praxis linked to that paradigmatic theory. Greater comprehension of the general usefulness of a Peircian Pragmaticist semiotic perspective (and `fallibilism') will enhance social action and collective responsibilities. As a philosopher, C. S. Peirce interpreted the world, but he himself did not attempt to change it. How can we incorporate a unifying `perspective' such as Peirce's theory into method' (both methodology and techniques)? How does that an emphasis on methodology improves sociology as an empirically based, rigorous discipline (a human `science') and various forms of praxis, especially applied sociology and public sociology? If politics is going to have any long-term impact, there has to be a degree of sophistication about the theories involved (e.g. conservation of fundamental human rights and liberties, reform within liberal parliamentary democracies, transformation within neo-conservative regimes, applied sociology in professions and occupations like social work and criminology, Feminist critique and action, GLTB action, neo-Gramscian critiques and Michael Burawoy's `public sociology' in the narrow, technical sense.) Praxis can include many forms of political activity that are not specifically informed by any well-developed and coherent theory. In terms of Peirce's Pragmaticist semiotics, we can translate theoretical awareness into praxis, to interpret and to change the world. Good theory and methodology is the most practical way to promote useful social action, applied sociology and public sociology. Anything less than Peircian Pragmaticism and semiotics tends to lead to fragmentation of `paradigms' or postmodernist nihilism.	1	J. I. Bakker

Current Perspectives in Social Theory	2009	0	This article is the first in a series that seeks to examine the Federal Bureau of Investigation' (FBI) surveillance of social philosopher and activist Herbert Marcuse between 1943 and 1976. We intend to map in parallel lines local, national, and international media representations of Marcuse, scholarly analysis of Marcuse's writings, Marcuse's own correspondence, speeches, and texts in comparison with the presentations of Herbert Marcuse in the collected FBI documents. Our goal is to assess what the Marcuse's FBI files tell us about the FBI, Marcuse, the New Left, and U. S. society in the 1960s. In particular, close attention is paid to examining events described inside the FBI documents occurring in the mid-1960s when Herbert Marcuse was emerging as a self-proclaimed Marxist radical, a father figure to New Left and countercultural activists, an influential author, public speaker, and teacher, and was beginning to be perceived as a threat by the FBI to U.S. national security. We seek to clarify if FBI documents can provide information and insight to help illuminate and understand U.S. social and cultural history, in this particular case, to assess how FBI documents measure up against scholarship and perceived views of Marcuse and the 1960s. We are thus interested both in what we can learn about Herbert Marcuse's life and times from these documents and what FBI surveillance and documents tell us about the FBI and U. S. intelligence services.	2	Stephen Gennaro; Douglas Kellner

Doreian, Patrick & Andrej Mrvar. 2009. 'Partitioning Signed Social Networks.' Social Networks. 31:1 1-11.	Social Networks	2009	15	Structural balance theory has proven useful for delineating the blockmodel structure of signed social networks. Even so, most of the observed signed networks are not perfectly balanced. One possibility for this is that in examining the dynamics underlying the generation of signed social networks. insufficient attention has been given to other processes and features of signed networks. These include: actors who have positive ties to pairs of actors linked by a negative relation or who belong to two Mutually hostile Subgroups; some actors that are viewed positively across the network despite the presence of negative ties and subsets of actors with negative ties towards each other. We suggest that instead viewing these situations as violations of structural balance, they can be seen as belonging to other relevant processes we call mediation, differential popularity and internal Subgroup hostility. Formalizing these ideas leads to the relaxed structural balance blockmodel as a proper generalization of structural balance blockmodels. Some formal properties concerning the relation between these two models are presented along with the properties of the fitting method proposed for the new blockmodel type. The new method is applied to four empirical data sets where improved fits with more nuanced interpretations are obtained. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	2	Patrick Doreian; Andrej Mrvar
Wang, Peng, Ken Sharpe, Garry Robins & Philippa Pattison. 2009. 'Exponential Random Graph (p*) Models for Affiliation Networks.' Social Networks. 31:1 12-25.	Social Networks	2009	29	Recent advances in Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs), or p* models, include new specifications that give a much better chance of model convergence for large networks compared with the traditional Markov models. Simulation based MCMC maximum likelihood estimation techniques have been developed to replace the pseudolikelihood method. To date most work on ERGMs has focused on one-mode networks, with little done in the case of affiliation networks with two or more types of nodes. This paper proposes ERGMs for two-mode affiliation networks drawing on the recent advances for one-mode networks, including new two-mode specifications. We investigate features of the models by simulation, and compared the goodness of fit results obtained using the maximum likelihood and pseudolikelihood approaches. We introduce a new approach to goodness of fit for network models, using a heuristic based on Mahalanobis distance. The classic Southern Women data and Australian Interlocking Director data are used as examples to show that the ERGM with the newly specified statistics is a powerful tool for statistical analysis of affiliation networks.

We elaborated vignettes as name generators to test whether the colleagues called upon in different situations were perceived as being more friends or more experts. The perceived level of expertise and friendship were evaluated with Likert-style scales. The results support our theoretical argument to the effect that the ``activation'' of a relationship is influenced by the type of uncertainty a person is confronted to.

Duijn, Marijtje, Krista Gile & Mark Handcock. 2009. 'a Framework for the Comparison of Maximum Pseudo-likelihood and Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Exponential Family Random Graph Models.' Social Networks. 31:1 52-62.	Social Networks	2009	21	The statistical modeling of social network data is difficult due to the complex dependence structure of the tie variables. Statistical exponential families of distributions provide a flexible way to model such dependence. They enable the statistical characteristics of the network to be encapsulated within an exponential family random graph (ERG) model. For a longtime, however, likelihood-based estimation was only feasible for ERG models assuming dyad independence. For more realistic and complex models inference has been based on the pseudo-likelihood. Recent advances in computational methods have made likelihood-based inference practical, and comparison of the different estimators possible. In this paper, we present methodology to enable estimators of ERG model parameters to be compared. We use this methodology to compare the bias, standard errors, coverage rates and efficiency of maximum likelihood and maximum pseudo-likelihood estimators. We also propose an improved pseudo-likelihood estimation method aimed at reducing bias. The comparison is performed using simulated social network data based on two versions of an empirically realistic network model, the first representing Lazega's law firm data and the second a modified version with increased transitivity. The framework considers estimation of both the natural and the mean-value parameters. The results clearly show the superiority of the likelihood-based estimators over those based on pseudo-likelihood, with the bias-reduced pseudo-likelihood out-performing the general pseudo-likelihood. The use of the mean-value parameterization provides insight into the differences between the estimators and when these differences will matter in practice. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Burger, Martijn & Vincent Buskens. 2009. 'Social Context and Network Formation: an Experimental Study.' Social Networks. 31:1 63-75.	Social Networks	2009	12	Recently, there has been increasing interest in determining which social network structures emerge as a consequence of the conscious actions of actors. Motivated by the belief that ``networks matter'' in reaching personal objectives, it is a natural assumption that actors try to optimize their network position. Starting from the notion that an optimal network position depends on the social context, we examine how actors change their networks to reach better positions in various contexts. Distinguishing between three social contexts (a neutral context, a context in which closed triads are costly, and a context in which closed triads are beneficial), theoretical results predict that emerging networks are contingent on the incentives that are present in these contexts. Experiments are used to test whether networks that are theoretically predicted to be stable are also stable experimentally. We find that emerging networks correspond to a large extent with the predicted networks. Consequently, they are contingent on the incentives present in various social contexts. In addition, we find that subjects tend to form specific stable networks with a higher probability than predicted, namely, efficient networks and networks in which everyone is equally well off.

Friedkin, Noah. 2009. 'Jaccard-spline Index of Structural Proximity in Contact Networks.' Social Networks. 31:1 76-84.	Social Networks	2009	0	Network analysts are increasingly being called upon to apply their expertise to groups for which the only available or reliable data is a contact network. With no opportunity to gather additional data, the merits of such applications depend on empirical studies that validate the employment of structural constructs based on contact networks. Fortunately, we possess such studies in abundance. One of the strongest research traditions in social network analysis is the development of formal constructs that may be employed in analyses of networks. I suggest that greater insight into predictive success of network constructs may be acquired by addressing the following question: what features of the contact network in which a dyad is situated allow the prediction of other relations with an accuracy that validates the imputation of the latter given data on the former? In this article, I present findings on the structural contexts of dyads in contact networks and the relationship of these contexts with two fundamental forms of cohesive cognitive relations-accorded interpersonal influence and perceived interpersonal agreement. Based on these findings, I formalize a measure of structural proximity in contact networks with values that correspond to the conditional probabilities of these two forms of cohesive cognitive relations. The substantive settings of this analysis are policy groups with members who are embedded in contact structures based on regular interpersonal communication on policy issues and cognitive structures based on perceived interpersonal agreement and accorded interpersonal influence.

We determine the VL control measure for various classes of networks. Furthermore, we provide two game theoretic interpretations of this measure. First it turns out that the VL control measure is a particular proper Shapley value of the associated cooperative network game. Secondly, we relate the measure to optimal strategies in an associated matrix search game. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	4	Ruud Hendrickx; Peter Borm; Rene Brink; Guillermo Owen
Cornwell, Benjamin. 2009. 'Good Health and the Bridging of Structural Holes.' Social Networks. 31:1 92-103.	Social Networks	2009	17	Bridges that span structural holes are often explained in terms of the entrepreneurial personalities or rational motivations of brokers, or structural processes that lead to the intersection of social foci. I argue that the existence and use of bridges in interpersonal networks also depends on individuals' health. Poor health may make it more difficult to withstand the pressures and to execute some of the common tasks associated with bridging(e.g., brokerage). I examine this possibility using egocentric network data on over 2500 older adults drawn from the recent National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP). Multivariate regression analyses show that both cognitive and functional health are significantly positively associated with bridging, net of sociodemographic and life-course controls. The relationship between functional (kinesthetic) health and bridging appears to be partially mediated by network composition, as older adults who have poorer functional health also tend to have networks that are richer in strong ties. Several potential mediation mechanisms are discussed. Cognitive function remains significantly associated with bridging net of network composition, Suggesting that the inherent challenges of maintaining bridging positions may be more difficult to cope with for those who have cognitive impairments than for those who have functional impairments such as limited mobility. An alternative explanation is that cognitively impaired individuals have more difficulty recognizing (and thus strategically using) bridges in their networks. Theoretical implications and possibilities for future research are discussed. (c) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.	1	Benjamin Cornwell

Sociological Methodology	2009	2	This paper presents a residual methods approach to identifying social mobility across race/ethnic categories. In traditional demographic accounting models, population growth is limited to changes in natural increase and migration. Other sources of population change are absorbed by the model residual and can be estimated only indirectly. While these residual estimates have been used to illuminate a number of elusive demographic processes, there has been little effort to incorporate shifts in racial identification into formal accounts of population change. In light of growing evidence that a number of Americans vie v race/ethnic identities as a personal choice, not as a fixed characteristic, mobility across racial categories may play important roles in the growl; of race/ethnic subpopulations and changes to the composition of the United States. To examine this potential, we derive a reduced-form population balancing equation that treats fertility and international migration as given and estimates survival from period life table data. After subtracting out national increase and net international migration and adjusting for changes in racial measurement and census coverage, we argue that the remaining error of closure provides a reasonable estimate of net interracial mobility among the native born. Using recent U S. Census and A CS microdata, we illustrate the impact that identity shifts may have had on the growth of race/ethnic subpopulations in the past quarter century. Findings suggest a small drift from the non-Hispanic white population into race/ethnic minority groups, though the pattern varies by age and between time periods.	2	Anthony Daniel Perez; Charles Hirschman
Wejnert, Cyprian. 2009. 'an Empirical Test of Respondent-driven Sampling: Point Estimates, Variance, Degree Measures, and Out-of-equilibrium Data.' Sociological Methodology. 39:1 73-116.	Sociological Methodology	2009	25	This paper, which is the first large-scale application of respondent-driven sampling (RDS) to nonhidden populations, tests three factors related to RDS estimation against institutional data using two WebRDS samples of university undergraduates. First, two methods of calculating RDS point estimates are compared. RDS estimates calculated using both methods coincide closely, but variance estimation, especially for small groups, is problematic for both methods. In one method, the bootstrap algorithm used to generate confidence intervals is found to underestimate variance. In the other method, where analytical variance estimation is possible, confidence intervals tend to overestimate variance. Second, RDS estimates are found to be robust against varying measures of individual degree. Results suggest the standard degree measure currently employed in most RDS studies is among the best-performing degree measures. Finally, RDS is found to be robust against the inclusion of out-of-equilibrium data. The results show that valid point estimates can be generated with RDS analysis using real data, but that further research is needed to improve variance estimation techniques.	1	Cyprian Wejnert
Grannis, Rick. 2009. 'Paths and Semipaths: Reconceptualizing Structural Cohesion in Terms of Directed Relations.' Sociological Methodology. 39:1 117-150.	Sociological Methodology	2009	0	In a groundbreaking article, Moody and While (2003) introduced the concept of structural cohesion, simultaneously characterizing emergent communities and their internally embedded layers by the number of node-independent paths interconnecting individuals. Like many studies, however, they ``corrected'' the directionality discovered in some of their data. While often done for important purposes, doing so potentially confounds structural cohesion with unrelated concepts. Some relations, especially those relating to the dynamic aspects of social life, are inherently directed, in whole or in part, and it may prove worthwhile to respect this directionality. In this article, I recast structural cohesion in terms of directed social relations and identify four distinct ways of measuring it. In two example data sets-hiring relations among graduate programs and trust relations among neighborhood residents-I show that only strong embeddedness, a type of structural cohesion emerging from directed relations, proves to be a powerful, robust, independent explanatory factor. I further show that if the directionality in the data in these examples had been ``corrected,'' the importance of structural cohesion would have been dramatically undervalued.	1	Rick Grannis
Savitz, Natalya & Stephen Raudenbush. 2009. 'Exploiting Spatial Dependence to Improve Measurement of Neighborhood Social Processes.' Sociological Methodology. 39:1 151-183.	Sociological Methodology	2009	5	A number of recent studies have used surveys of neighborhood informants and direct observation of city streets to assess aspects of community life such as collective efficacy, the density of kin networks, and social disorder Raudenbush and Sampson (1999a) have coined the term ``ecometrics'' to denote the study of the reliability and validity of such assessments. Random errors of measurement will attenuate the associations between these assessments and key outcomes. To address this problem, some studies have used empirical Bayes methods to reduce such biases, while assuming that neighborhood random effects are statistically independent. In this paper we show that the precision and validity of ecometric measures can be considerably improved by exploiting the spatial dependence of neighborhood social processes within the framework of empirical Bayes shrinkage. We compare three estimators of a neighborhood social process: the ordinary least squares estimator (OLS), an empirical Bayes estimator based on the independence assumption (EBE), and an empirical Bayes estimator that exploits spatial dependence (EBS). Under our model assumptions, EBS performs better than EBE and OLS in terms of expected mean squared error loss. The benefits of EBS relative to EBE and OLS depend on the magnitude of spatial dependence, the degree of neighborhood heterogeneity, as well as neighborhood's sample size. A cross-validation study using the original 1995 data from the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods and a replication of that survey in 2002 show that the empirical benefits of EBS approximate those expected under our model assumptions; EBS is more internally consistent and temporally stable and demonstrates higher concurrent and predictive validity. A fully Bayes approach has the same properties as does the empirical Bayes approach, but it is preferable when the number of neighborhoods is small.	2	Natalya Verbitsky Savitz; Stephen W. Raudenbush
Wu, Lawrence & Steven Martin. 2009. 'Effects of Exposure on Prevalence and Cumulative Relative Risk: Direct and Indirect Effects in a Recursive Hazard Model.' Sociological Methodology. 39:1 185-232.	Sociological Methodology	2009	0	This paper outlines decomposition methods for assessing how exposure affects prevalence and cumulative relative risk. Let x denote a vector of exogenous covariates and suppose that a single dimension of time t governs two event processes T(1) and T(2) - If the occurrence of the event T(1) determines entry into the risk of the event T(2), then subgroup variation in T(1) will affect the prevalence T(2), even if subgroups in the population are otherwise identical. Although researchers often acknowledge this phenomenon, the literature has not provided procedures to assess the magnitude of an exposure effect of T(1) on the prevalence of T(2). We derive decompositions that assess how variation in exposure generated by direct and indirect effects of the covariates x affect measures of absolute and relative prevalence of T(2). We employ a parametric but highly flexible specification for baseline hazard for the T(1) and T(2) processes and use the resulting parametric proportional hazard model to illustrate the direct and indirect effects of family structure when T(1) is age at first sexual intercourse and T(2) is age at a premarital first birth for data on a cohort of non-hispanic white U.S. women.	2	Lawrence L.

Powers, Daniel & Myeong-Su Yun. 2009. 'Multivariate Decomposition for Hazard Rate Models.' Sociological Methodology. 39:1 233-263.	Sociological Methodology	2009	4	We develop a regression decomposition technique for hazard rate models, where the difference in observed rates is decomposed into components attributable to group differences in characteristics and group differences in effects. The baseline hazard is specified using a piecewise constant exponential model, which leads to convenient estimation based on a Poisson regression model fit to person-period, or split-episode data. This specification allows for a flexible representation of the baseline hazard and provides a straightforward way to introduce time-varying covariates and time-varying effects. We provide computational details underlying the method and apply the technique to the decomposition of the black-white difference in first premarital birth rates into components reflecting characteristics and effect contributions of several predictors, as well as the effect contribution attributable to race differences in the baseline hazard.	2	Daniel A.

Hippel, Paul. 2009. 'How to Impute Interactions, Squares and Other Transformed Variables.' Sociological Methodology. 39:1 265-291.	Sociological Methodology	2009	14	Researchers often carry out regression analysis using data that have missing values. Missing values can be filled in using multiple, imputation, but imputation is tricky if the regression includes interactions, squares, or other transformations of the regressors. In this paper, we examine different approaches to imputing transformed variables; and we find one simple method that works well across a variety of circumstances. Our recommendation is to transform, then impute-i.e., calculate the interactions or squares in the incomplete data and then impute these transformations like any other variable. The transform-then-impute method yields good regression estimates, even though the imputed values are often inconsistent with one another. It is tempting to try and ``fix'' the inconsistencies in the imputed values, but methods that do so lead to biased regression estimates. Such biased methods include the passive imputation strategy implemented by the popular ice command for Stata.	1	Paul T. Hippel
Western, Bruce & Deirdre Bloome. 2009. 'Variance Function Regressions for Studying Inequality.' Sociological Methodology. 39:1 293-326.	Sociological Methodology	2009	8	Regression-based studies of inequality model only between-group differences, yet often these differences are far exceeded by residual inequality. Residual inequality is usually attributed to measurement error or the influence of unobserved characteristics. We present a model, called variance function regression, that includes covariates for both the mean and variance of a dependent variable. In this model, the residual variance is treated as a target for analysis. In analyses of inequality, the residual variance might be interpreted as measuring risk or insecurity. Variance function regressions are illustrated in an analysis of panel data on earnings among released prisoners in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. We extend the model to a decomposition analysis, relating the change in inequality to compositional changes in the population and changes in coefficients for the mean and variance. The decomposition is applied to the trend in US. earnings inequality among male Workers, 1970 to 2005.	2	Bruce Western; Deirdre Bloome
Kirby, James & Kenneth Bollen. 2009. 'Using Instrumental Variable Tests to Evaluate Model Specification in Latent Variable Structural Equation Models.' Sociological Methodology. 39:1 327-355.	Sociological Methodology	2009	5	Structural equation modeling (SEM) with latent variables is a powerful tool for social and behavioral scientists, combining many of the strengths of psychometrics and econometrics into a single framework. The most common estimator for SEM is the full information maximum likelihood (ML) estimator, but there is continuing interest in limited information estimators because of their distributional robustness and their greater resistance to structural specification errors. However, the literature discussing model fit for limited information estimators for latent variable models is sparse compared with that for full-information estimators. We address this shortcoming by providing several specification tests based on the 2SLS estimator for latent variable structural equation models developed by Bollen (1996). We explain how these tests can be used not only to identify a misspecified model but to help diagnose the source of misspecification within a model. We present and discuss results from a Monte Carlo experiment designed to evaluate the finite sample properties of these tests. Our findings suggest that the 2SLS tests successfully identify most misspecified models, even those with modest misspecification, and that they provide researchers with information that can help diagnose the source of misspecification.	2	James B.

Robinson, Erin. 2009. 'Competing Frames of Environmental Contamination: Influences on Grassroots Community Mobilization.' Sociological Spectrum. 29:1 3-27.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	1	This article provides an analysis of competing frames of environmental contamination in a working class neighborhood of Buffalo, New York. Through in-depth interviewing, document analysis, and participant observation, I locate and analyze emerging frames presented from local media and government sources. I argue that the most prominent frames emerged by means of local media and government, as residents referred to these most commonly as sources for their understanding of the issues facing their community. However, the information they were most likely to portray was based on resident activist and scientific reports, respectively. I argue that these frames competed in a way that challenged mobilization efforts. How do individuals work together when they may believe entirely different frameworks as explanations of the problems they seek to resolve? Framing influences which message individuals hear, which they choose to adopt, and whether they react. In this case, two prominent frames emerging from media and government sources influence mobilization outcomes by creating community divisions and unifications, based on the source residents choose to believe.	1	Erin E.

Sociological Spectrum	2009	4	In this article, we demonstrate how the taken-for-granted, inner-workings of culture can become implicated in the (in)visibility of minority members. We seek to illuminate ways in which institutions may unwittingly facilitate (in)visibility through their organizational habitus. We begin by providing further evidence of invisibility and visibility as real and commonly experienced psychosocial phenomena among minorities within predominantly white, institutional settings. In particular, we argue that a minority's inconspicuousness can be simultaneously fused together with one's conspicuousness to form what we call racial/ethnic (in)visibility. This study employs focus-group data collected from a sample of administrators and faculty from elite K-12 independent (private) schools, an institution that admittedly has been slow to make cultural change in its racial/ethnic ideologies and practices.	2	Katrina Bell McDonald; Adia M.

Desmond, Scott, Sarah Soper, David Purpura & Elizabeth Smith. 2009. 'Religiosity, Moral Beliefs, and Delinquency: Does the Effect of Religiosity on Delinquency Depend on Moral Beliefs?.' Sociological Spectrum. 29:1 51-71.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	2	Does the effect of religiosity on delinquent behavior depend on moral beliefs? For example, will religious adolescents refrain from using marijuana, even if they do not believe using marijuana is wrong? We addressed this question using data from the third and fourth waves of the National Youth Survey. The results indicated a significant interaction between religiosity and moral beliefs for marijuana use and getting drunk, but not for hitting or property offenses. Religiosity has a stronger effect on marijuana and alcohol use when adolescents also believe these behaviors are wrong. Conversely, when it is not accompanied by strong moral beliefs, religiosity has less of an effect on marijuana use and drinking.	4	Scott A. Desmond; Sarah E. Soper; David J. Purpura; Elizabeth Smith
Dumais, Susan. 2009. 'Cohort and Gender Differences in Extracurricular Participation: the Relationship Between Activities, Math Achievement, and College Expectations.' Sociological Spectrum. 29:1 72-100.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	5	Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 and the Educational Longitudinal Study of 2002, I analyze the association that students' extracurricular activities have with two academic outcomes: mathematics achievement test scores and college expectations. I consider changes between cohorts and gender differences within each cohort. While prior achievement and expectations have the strongest associations with the dependent variables, relationships do appear between extracurricular participation and the dependent variables. There is only one cohort difference in the association between activities and math achievement test scores; computer use was positively associated with students' scores in the 1990s, but had no association with students' scores in the 2000s. School-sponsored activities were associated with higher scores for all students, while television-watching and hanging out with friends were negatively associated with them. School activities were positively associated with the college expectations of students in both cohorts, while spending time hanging out with friends was negatively associated with expectations, especially for students in the later cohort. There were a few gender differences in the association between activities and math scores, but no gender differences in the association between activities and college expectations. The findings indicate that many of the same activities are relevant for math achievement and college expectations in the two time periods.	1	Susan A. Dumais
Walker, Jacob. 2009. 'County Level Suicide Rates and Social Integration: Urbanicity and Its Role in the Relationship.' Sociological Spectrum. 29:1 101-135.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	2	This study adds to the existing research concerning ecological relationships between suicide rates, social interaction, and urbanicity in the United States. Age-sex-race adjusted five-year averaged suicide rates for 1993-1997 and various measures of urbanicity are used. Some proposed relationships held true, while others indicate that social integration and urbanicity are so intertwined in their effects on suicide that no clear, unidirectional pattern emerges. The religious affiliation measure captured unique variations in the role religion plays in this relationship, depending on how urbanicity was measured. Findings suggest closer attention needs to be paid to how both urbanicity and religious affiliation are measured. Overall, vast regional variation exists in suicide rates and the role of urbanization can be misunderstood if not properly specified.	1	Jacob T. Walker
Wortham, Robert. 2009. 'Web Du Bois, the Black Church, and the Sociological Study of Religion.' Sociological Spectrum. 29:2 144-172.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	3	During his early sociological period (1896-1914), Du Bois published several empirically-based studies on the Black Church. Many topics were addressed that are relevant to the contemporary study of the Black Church and the sociology of religion. Du Bois utilized methodological triangulation to empirically ground his studies of the Black Church. Census, survey, and ethnographic data were integrated to provide a comprehensive picture of the role of the Black Church in the African American community. He addressed the social construction of African American religious identity and provided an early functional analysis of the Black Church. The association between religion and social class was recognized, and Du Bois was a pioneer in the area of congregational studies addressing such issues as church expenditures and membership patterns and generating surveys of children's religious beliefs and ministerial effectiveness. Extensive data were collected on Black Church membership in large cities and small communities. These data make it possible to reconstruct the Black Church religious economy in these areas. Du Bois' sociological work on religion provides a link to the discipline's past and a bridge to its future.	1	Robert A. Wortham

Bivariate and ordered logit results based on Faith Factor 2000 Project data across seven denominations suggest minimal denominational influence; however, church environment, including worship features and sermonic emphasis, as well as varied programs, positively influence participation. Additionally, participation decline is apparent among rural congregations. Results help illumine profiles of Black churches most likely to experience high or low levels of participation.	1	Sandra L.

Sociological Spectrum	2009	2	In recent years, a number of excellent ethnographic and qualitative studies have signaled a growing interest among scientists in immigrants and their religious practices. Few large-scale studies, however, have examined the religious practices and family religious context of Asian immigrant adolescents. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a large nationally representative survey, we explore the important associations between ethnic and family contexts and Asian American adolescents' religiosity. Specifically, we find that first generation Asian American adolescents report higher levels of public and private aspects of religiosity than their native-born counterparts; Filipino and Korean immigrant adolescents report higher religiosity than Chinese immigrant children; however, the most important factor influencing Asian immigrant children's religiosity is their parent's religious practices and the concordance between parent and adolescent's religious affiliations. Protestant Asian adolescents who are also from a Protestant family report higher religiosity than Buddhist or Catholic adolescents who are from a Buddhist or Catholic family. Implications of these patterns for the intergenerational transmission of religious faith and other aspects of immigrant religious practices are discussed.	2	Jiexia Elisa Zhai; Charles E. Stokes

Sociological Spectrum	2009	0	Using a national sample of congregations, the current study builds upon Lincoln and Mamiya's (1990) argument of the institutional importance of black churches. It does so by suggesting that, all things being equal, black congregations are more likely than are white, Hispanic, and Asian congregations to engage in voter registration efforts; however, the greater involvement of black congregations, relative to congregations of other ethnic groups, in community organizing has much to do with the greater social justice orientation of black congregations.	1	R.

Cherry, Stephen. 2009. 'Engaging a Spirit From the East: Asian American Christians and Civic Life.' Sociological Spectrum. 29:2 249-272.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	2	Asian Americans are one the fastest growing nonwhite populations and nearly half are Christian. Little is known, however, about the impact of religion on their civic lives beyond volunteerism. This article is a comparative analysis of Asian American Catholic and Protestant civic involvements. In the general population some have argued that the acquisition of civic skills is hindered by Catholic affiliation relative to Protestantism, but it is not know if the same is true for Asian Americans. I explore these issues with data from the Social Capital Benchmark (SCCB) Survey using logistic regression analysis. Results suggest that Protestant Asian Americans are more likely to vote and be interested in politics than Asian American Catholics, but being Protestant is not a significant predictor of community participation. I conclude that religion, particularly with small group participation, is an important resource for all Asian American Christians across broad measures of civic life.	1	Stephen M. Cherry
Lewis, Robyn & John Taylor. 2009. 'the Social Significance of Religious Resources in the Prediction of Mattering to Others: African American and White Contrasts.' Sociological Spectrum. 29:2 273-294.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	2	The perception of mattering, defined as one's perceived significance to others, is likely influenced by the interpersonal and intrapersonal dimensions of religious faith. Using data from a community study conducted in Miami-Dade County, this study examines whether private and public aspects of religiosity are independently as well as mutually associated with perceptions of mattering, net of secular social resources. We also consider whether the availability of religious and secular resources varies by race/ethnicity, and whether such differences account for race/ethnic differences in perceptions of mattering. Findings demonstrate that private religiosity and membership in a religious organization, in addition to secular social support and integration, are independently associated with perceptions of mattering. Findings also reveal that, compared to Whites, the higher levels of mattering reported by African Americans are largely explained by their higher levels of private religiosity and greater likelihood of belonging to religious organizations and attending religious services.	2	Robyn Lewis; John Taylor

Sociological Spectrum. 29:2 295-317.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	0	Mainland Chinese elders constitute a unique group in popular Christian participation and conversion. This work aims to explore the social contexts and cultural facets of Mainland Chinese elders' Christian practice in the United States. Based on face-to-face, in-depth interviews with 20 Mainland Chinese elders as well as participant observation at selected congregational settings, this study suggests that the existing theories on aging and religion as well as religious practice among immigrants are inadequate to explain Chinese elderly immigrants' participation in Christian congregations in the U.S. Instead, social isolation and lack of social support system resulting from immigration and aging process serve as the major drive for the elders to pursue social and cultural recognition from Chinese Christian gatherings. Besides religious services, social service functions of churches and opportunities for fellowship are other factors that explain Chinese elders' church involvement. In conclusion, we argue that social and cultural services are needed to particularly assist Chinese seniors to adjust and adapt to their elderly lives in the host country.	2	Gehui Zhang; Heying Jenny Zhan
Packard, Josh. 2009. 'Running Off-tackle Through the Last Bastion: Women, Resistance, and Professional Football.' Sociological Spectrum. 29:3 321-345.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	0	This article discusses the mechanisms that must be in place in order for women to successfully resist institutionalized gender norms. This research draws on over 200hours of observations of and 20 in-depth interviews with women playing full contact football, a sport traditionally dominated by men and firmly planted in the culture of the U.S. as synonymous with masculinity. Following the work of recent calls by gender scholars to treat gender as a social institution, this research shows that at least four components must be in place for sustained, successful resistance to a social institution. First, resistance must be a conscious activity. Second, any resistance must involve engaging in an abnormal activity. Third, any deviant or abnormal activity must take place in an otherwise legitimate social context. Finally, as the creation and maintenance of a social institution is an inherently social enterprise, so, too, is institutional resistance. This research contributes to scholarship on gender and social institutions by showing some strategies for increasing possibilities for personal expression.	1	Josh Packard
Schoepflin, Todd. 2009. 'Perspectives of Interracial Dating at a Predominantly White University.' Sociological Spectrum. 29:3 346-370.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	1	This study examined the viewpoints and experiences of college students with regard to interracial dating. Thirty-five black students and 35 white students in attendance at a predominantly white university participated in face-to-face interviews. Black men and white women expressed more favorable attitudes toward interracial dating compared with black women and white men. Some white females downplayed the significance of interracial relationships, going so far as to suggest it is a nonissue, apparently unaware that it is an issue of concern to many students, especially black females. The concept of white privilege is discussed as an explanation for white students' perspectives. Students who dated interracially faced social consequences, including negative reactions from peers and family members. Findings reveal that the dating landscape differs for students based on their race and gender. In particular, the dating pool appears to be limited for black females at the institution under study.	1	Todd Schoepflin
Lippmann, Stephen. 2009. 'Local Labor Market Dynamics and Self-employment in Rural New England.' Sociological Spectrum. 29:3 371-400.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	0	As rates of self-employment and entrepreneurial activity grow in the U.S., sociologists are beginning to consider the causes and consequences of this form of employment more seriously. While the sociological contributions to entrepreneurial research take seriously the social context in which self-employment occurs, few studies focus explicitly on the effects of social and economic contexts on rates of self-employment in particular regions. I fill this gap by examining the effects of a variety of local labor-market, population, and economic characteristics on county-level self-employment rates in three predominantly rural states: Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. I find that counties with higher proportions of their labor forces in extractive industries and that have experienced greater declines in the primary sector had higher rates of poverty and unemployment; however, self-employment is negatively related to county-level poverty rates, indicating that self-employment may provide opportunities for those in rural counties undergoing economic transformations.	1	Stephen Lippmann

Sociological Spectrum	2009	0	The game of poker has dramatically increased in popularity in America over the past decade, and includes a new trend in poker in which tournaments are played with no monetary wagering. These free poker tournaments are the primary focus of this project. Our interest in these free poker tournaments was twofold: first, we wished to identify what would motivate a person to play poker when there is no profit motive; second, we wanted to learn how the social dynamics of the game itself may or may not change when monetary risk is not present. Through covert participant observation of free poker tournaments at four different locations we were able to discover three main motivations among the players: sharpening skills for later cash games, sociability, and gaining the status of a regular player. We also discovered that the tenor and tempo of the game tended to vary not as a function of the location, but rather because of the social class of the players. We offer several hypotheses to guide future research endeavors in this area.	2	Christopher Bradley; Ryan D. Schroeder

Examining the dynamic nature of neighborhoods contributes to an understanding of health disparities.	2	Erin Ruel; Stephanie A. Robert

Sociological Spectrum	2009	2	Building on Belsky's process model of the determinants of parenting and using a nationally representative dataset of U.S. adolescents, this article examines the relationship between parental satisfaction and parents' perceptions of their adolescents and their own personal and social resources. As such, it provides a coherent framework for understanding parental well-being during a critical stage of the family life course. The results suggest that parental satisfaction is negatively related to parents' perceptions that their adolescents are involved in problem behaviors or experiencing challenges in other domains of their lives; however, the relationship between parental satisfaction and adolescents' problem behaviors is mediated by parents' perceptions of their adolescents' characters, including whether or not they have a bad temper and their levels of trustworthiness. With respect to personal and social resources, parents' educational achievement and marital status are positively related to parental satisfaction, and the level of conflict in the spousal relationship is negatively related to parental satisfaction.	1	T.

Robinson, James. 2009. 'American Poverty Cause Beliefs and Structured Inequality Legitimation.' Sociological Spectrum. 29:4 489-518.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	4	Poverty cause attribution research has sporadically explored social stratification beliefs for over three decades with mixed results. Explanations given for why there are poor people in America may reveal much about underlying structured inequality legitimating mechanisms. Using multiple regression, one-way ANOVA, and frequency distribution analyses, I uncover a conservative-liberal continuum underlying American poverty cause attributions. Past explanations for the mostly mixed nature of American attributions toward poverty are questioned. I suggest a more simple and straightforward explanation: mixed attribution styles, situated on a conservative-liberal continuum, may arise from American's distinguishing between at least two groups of poor peopledeserving and undeservingsuggesting policy and future research agendas.	1	James W.

Sociological Spectrum	2009	1	An important consequence of the economic structure transformations of recent decades is increased income inequality. While an extensive literature has explored the relationship between economic restructuring and inequality, the unique contribution of this article is that it develops and tests a model that explores the mechanisms by which this process occurs. Specifically, the intervening role of the income gap between the well-educated and those with lower levels of education (the educational income gap) and other moderating factors are explored. The 5 percent Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) data from the 2000 Census of Population and Housing was used in the analysis. The data provided strong support for the model. It was found that economic structure and the moderating variables were strongly related to the educational income gap, which in turn was strongly related to overall income inequality. Generally, both the educational income gap and overall income inequality were greater in geographic areas with higher proportions of the labor force employed in services, and both were lower where greater proportions of the labor force were employed in goods-producing industries.	2	Don E.

Identity-discrepancy theory is used to determine whether discrepancies between obligatory and self-in-role meanings are related to role satisfaction. Findings suggest that discrepancies in some nurse role meaning dimensions are predictive of role satisfaction. The implications for role exit and the nursing shortage are discussed.	1	Kathleen M.

Sociological Spectrum	2009	1	Using two panels of employer-employee matched datasets, this study investigates the changes in work morale for white-collar employeesmanagerial, professional, and technical (MPT) workersand how such changes are related to organizational restructuring. Findings suggest little changes in work morale of white-collar workersmore MPT workers in the 2002 data strongly agreed that they ofeel proud to be working for their employerso than did their counterparts in 1991, but fewer of them agreed to the statement. Moreover, managerial employees have been increasingly akin to the tall organizational hierarchy, but display some resentment toward teamwork. In contrast, work morale of professional/technical workers is not related to the changes in organizational hierarchy and teamwork, but their positive reaction to internal labor markets has significantly declined from 1991 to 2002. The conclusion section summarizes major findings and discusses implications for future studies on this subject.	1	Song Yang
Kraus, Rachel. 2009. 'Straddling the Sacred and Secular: Creating a Spiritual Experience Through Belly Dance.' Sociological Spectrum. 29:5 598-625.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	3	Few studies examine spiritual experiences through seemingly secular activities. Who has spiritual experiences while belly dancing? How does belly dance become spiritual? Using surveys and interviews with 77 belly dancers in the United States, this study shows that belly dance is spiritual for people who consider spirituality important in their lives, have belly danced for many years, rarely attend worship services, and are not affiliated with Judeo-Christian religions. Belly dance becomes spiritual when dancers olet goo and experience various connections. The dance itself and the environment in which one dances facilitate spiritual experiences. Implications for spirituality are discussed.	1	Rachel Kraus
Ven, Thomas & Jeffrey Beck. 2009. 'Getting Drunk and Hooking Up: an Exploratory Study of the Relationship Between Alcohol Intoxication and Casual Coupling in a University Sample.' Sociological Spectrum. 29:5 626-648.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	0	Alcohol use and abuse on American college campuses has raised significant concerns among university officials, scholars, and social critics. One of the principal concerns is that heavy drinking is associated with risky sexual behavior and sexual victimization among college samples. The current study seeks to enhance our understanding regarding the relationship between alcohol intoxication and sex by investigating the ways in which college students use alcohol as a tool to facilitate, explain, and justify sexual encounters and casual coupling (e.g., kissing, omaking out,o petting, touching). Guided by theoretical perspectives designed to explain the role of rhetoric in explaining and justifying deviant behavior, we analyze 469 qualitative odrinking storieso and 32 interviews collected at three university sites. Our findings suggest that college drinkers view alcohol as a disinhibiting force that elevates the potential for sexuality and that alcohol intoxication is also used as a resource to justify casual coupling events, before and after they occur. Finally, our respondents describe the informal strategies they have developed to negotiate the potential for risky sexual encounters in an environment where disinhibited actors draw from widely available cultural scripts to excuse and justify untoward behavior.	2	Thomas Vander Ven; Jeffrey Beck

'Missed Call? a Reexamination of Sport Fans' and Nonfans' Alcohol Usage and Alcohol-related Experiences.' Sociological Spectrum. 29:5 649-658.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	2	The current investigation attempted to replicate and extend Nelson and Weschler's (2003) research that indicated that college student sport fans were more likely to report problematic alcohol usage and more negative alcohol-related experiences in comparison to nonfans. In addition to utilizing the original study's operational definition of fan (spectator-based), 323 college students were categorized according to more traditional measures of fandom, specifically levels of fan and team identification. Contrary to the previous research, the results indicated that fans' and nonfans' alcohol usage and experiences of negative alcohol-related events were not significantly different. Additionally, both forms of identification (fan and team) failed to predict problematic alcohol usage and negative alcohol-related experiences. Although the results were unaffected by the operational definitions of fan, distinguishing certain subgroups of fans may be important in regards to clarifying and advancing our understanding of the potential relationship between sport and alcohol usage. These distinctions could guide efforts to reduce problematic alcohol usage.	6	Christian M. End; Michael C. Davis; Jeff M. Kretschmar; Jamonn Campbell; David G. Mueller; Shaye S. Worthman

'There Must Be Some Type of Misunderstanding, There Must Be Some Kind of Mistake: the Deviance Disavowal Strategies of Men Arrested in Internet Sex Stings (2008 Presidential Address).' Sociological Spectrum. 29:6 661-676.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	2	Revolutionary advances in telecommunications technology have created a ovirtual world.o There are a variety of new social phenomena associated with this novel milieu. This represents an excellent opportunity for the discipline of sociology to revisit its descriptive roots. This is especially true for the sociology of deviant behavior because new forms of deviance are clearly related to technological innovations (e.g., Internet crimes against children, cyberstalking, and cyberbullying). The current undertaking examines the deviance disavowal strategies of men arrested in Internet sex stings. The data consisted of the videotaped police interrogations of 18 subjects, about half of whom were arrested in televised stings. The results indicate these men engaged in three disavowal strategies seeking to maintain a normal definition of self and manage the stigma of their arrest. Directions for future studies in the sociology of deviance are suggested.	1	Keith F. Durkin
Marcello, Melissa & Robert Perrucci. 2009. 'Civic Engagement Among Small-group Participants: Creating Community or Self-absorption?.' Sociological Spectrum. 29:6 677-699.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	0	Small support groups are a relatively new form of voluntary association appearing in the American landscape. Examining the larger implications of the osmall group movemento for civic life has led some to see an overall positive effect on wider community activities, while others have viewed small-group participants as self-absorbed and withdrawing from participation in civic activities. Using a national sample of small-group participants, we examine the effects on civic engagement stemming from the social characteristics of participants, the type of small group (religious, secular, or mixed), and the opportunity to develop social capital through participation in small groups. Findings indicate that members of religious small groups do not actively engage in civic affairs, but members of secular and mixed groups do participate in a broad range of civic activities. Differences in social participation can be attributed to characteristics of the small groups (formalization and cohesion) and to some characteristics of members (education). When small support groups offer members the opportunity to acquire civic skills, to exchange information, and to develop self-efficacy, there is more interest and activity in civic affairs.	2	Melissa Katherine Marcello; Robert Perrucci

Sociological Spectrum	2009	3	Retrospective narratives of change consistently emphasize the importance of religious devotion and spirituality in initiating sustained behavioral change, but little is known about the process by which religion and spirituality promote desistance from crime. The current project is designed to add to the knowledge of the relationship between religion/spirituality and behavioral change by systematically investigating the ways that men residing in a halfway house define the role of religion/spirituality as an emotion-coping mechanism in their desistance efforts. The qualitative data reveal that religion/spirituality is primarily used by these men currently undergoing behavioral change as a form of emotional comfort, a distraction from current stressors, and as factor demarcating the transition from deviance to a more conventional life. Suggestions for religious programming designed to stimulate behavioral changes are discussed.	2	Ryan D. Schroeder; John F. Frana
Zweigenhaft, Richard. 2009. 'Prep School and Public School Graduates: Who Attends College Reunions, Who Donates, Who Doesn't, and Why.' Sociological Spectrum. 29:6 742-750.	Sociological Spectrum	2009	0	As early as the 1920s, studies at various elite colleges revealed that public school graduates outperformed private school graduates academically, and more recent research indicates various differences in life patterns between these two groups 25 years after graduation. The two new studies presented here, which look at attendance at college reunions and donations to one's college, extend that earlier work. At a New England college, public school graduates were more likely than the private school graduates to attend their 30th, 35th, and 40th year college reunions. Donations to the school showed that public school graduates were somewhat more likely to make contributions than private school graduates, and graduates of the most socially elite boarding schools were especially unlikely to have made contributions. These findings are discussed in terms of the varying roles that prep schools and colleges play in one's identity.	1	Richard L. Zweigenhaft
Downey, Douglas, James Ainsworth & Zhenchao Qlan. 2009. 'Rethinking the Attitude-achievement Paradox Among Blacks.' Sociology of Education. 82:1 1-19.	Sociology of Education	2009	11	Blacks offer positive responses to a wide range of survey questions gauging attitudes toward schooling, yet perform less well in school than do whites. The credibility of blacks' attitudes is a central issue among competing explanations for this paradox. In this article, the authors assess questions about the validity of blacks' pro-school attitudes with the National Education Longitudinal Study. Two findings prompted the authors to rethink the paradox. First, a key reason for doubting blacks' pro-school attitudes-that they fail to predict achievement-does not generalize to the national data. Second, rather than challenge the credibility of blacks' pro-school attitudes, the results reveal minimal differences in attitude-achievement associations between blacks and other minority groups. These patterns have implications for thinking about whether blacks resist schooling.	3	Douglas B. Downey; James W. Ainsworth; Zhenchao Qlan
Herman, Melissa. 2009. 'the Black-white-other Achievement Gap: Testing Theories of Academic Performance Among Multiracial and Monoracial Adolescents.' Sociology of Education. 82:1 20-46.	Sociology of Education	2009	7	The study presented here tested three theories of racial differences in academic performance among monoracial and multiracial high school students. These theories (status attainment, oppositional culture, and educational attitudes) were developed to explain differences in achievement among monoracial groups, but the study tested how the theories apply to a multiracial sample. The results show that ethnic identity and experiences of ethnic discrimination are not strong factors in explaining academic performance among multiracial or monoracial students. Instead, the grades of multiracial students are related to their concrete beliefs about the consequences of school failure, the educational values of their peers, and the racial composition of their neighborhoods and schools. Additional descriptive statistics found that multiracial students who self-identify as black or Hispanic achieve lower grades than do those who self-identify as white or Asian. The author suggests a transracial theory of academic performance that considers the effects of contexts.	1	Melissa R. Herman
Kelly, Sean. 2009. 'the Black-white Gap in Mathematics Course Taking.' Sociology of Education. 82:1 47-69.	Sociology of Education	2009	17	Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study, this study investigated differences in the mathematics course taking of white and black students. Because of lower levels of achievement, prior course taking, and lower socioeconomic status, black students are much more likely than are white students to be enrolled in low-track mathematics courses by the 10th grade. Using multilevel models for categorical outcomes, the Study found that the black-white gap in mathematics course taking is the greatest in integrated schools where black Students are in the minority and cannot be entirely accounted for by individual-level differences in the course-taking qualifications or family backgrounds of white and black students. This finding was obscured in prior research by the failure to model course taking adequately between and within schools. Course placement policies and enrollment patterns should be monitored to ensure effective schooling for all students.	1	Sean Kelly
Bennett, Pamela & Amy Lutz. 2009. 'How African American Is the Net Black Advantage? Differences in College Attendance Among Immigrant Blacks, Native Blacks, and Whites.' Sociology of Education. 82:1 70-99.	Sociology of Education	2009	15	Previous research has shown that although a smaller proportion of black high school graduates than white high school graduates attend college, black high school graduates are more likely than white high school graduates to attend college net of differences in socioeconomic family background and academic performance. Yet, the overrepresentation of black immigrants in selective colleges and theoretical work on immigrant incorporation raises the question of whether this net black advantage is very African American. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988, logistic regression, and propensity score analysis, the authors investigated whether the net black advantage reflects the educational trajectories of immigrant rather than native blacks. They found dual, yet distinct, cases of the net black advantage, such that native blacks are more likely than are comparable whites to attend all types of colleges, whereas immigrant blacks are only more likely than similar whites to attend selective colleges. The theoretical and social stratification implications of the findings are explored.	2	Pamela R. Bennett; Amy Lutz
Simic, Milena & Tim Rhodes. 2009. 'Violence, Dignity and Hiv Vulnerability: Street Sex Work in Serbia.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:1 1-16.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	21	Sex work can be contextualised by violence, social and material inequality, and HIV vulnerability. We undertook a qualitative study to explore female and transvestite sex workers' accounts (n = 31) of HIV risk environment in Belgrade and Pancevo, Serbia. Violence emerged as a key theme. Accounts emphasise the ubiquity of multiple forms of everyday violence - physical, emotional, social in street sex work scenes, linked to police as much as clients. We highlight the salience of emotions in sex work risk management, in which the preservation of dignity is of prime importance. Accounts draw upon narratives of hygiene and responsibility which, we argue, seek to resist portrayals, normative to this setting, of sex workers as contaminated and irresponsible. Findings highlight how the ubiquity of the risk of violence in street sex work scenes reflects institutionalised social inequalities and injustices. Sex workers are inevitably participant in the cycle of symbolic violence they seek to resist. The challenges for HIV prevention are therefore considerable, and require interventions which not only seek to foster safer micro-environments of sex work but structural changes in the welfare, criminal justice and other social institutions which reproduce the cycle of violence faced by sex workers day to day.	2	Milena Simic; Tim Rhodes

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	8	Stigma obstructs HIV/AIDS prevention and care worldwide, including in the Caribbean, where the prevalence of AIDS is second only to sub-Saharan Africa. To contextualise the experience of AIDS stigma in health services in Grenada and Trinidad and Tobago, we conducted eight focus groups with 51 people living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA), families, and service providers. Quasi-deductive content analysis revealed consonance with Western and Northern conceptualisations of AIDS stigma wherein stigma is enacted upon marginalised populations and reinforced through psycho-sociological processes comparing `in' and `out' groups. Socially constructed to be physically contagious and socially deviant, PLHA are scorned by some service providers, especially when they are perceived to be gay or bisexual. PLHA and providers identified passive neglect and active refusal by hospital and clinic staff to provide care to PLHA. Institutional practices for safeguarding patient confidentiality are perceived as marginally enforced. Interventions are needed to reduce provider stigma so the public will access HIV testing and PLHA will seek treatment.	4	Scott Edward Rutledge; Neil Abell; Jacqueline Padmore; Theresa J. McCann
Wilkin, Peter. 2009. 'Are You Sitting Comfortably? the Political Economy of the Body.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:1 35-50.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	2	The aim of this paper is to examine the relationship between the mass production of furniture in modern industrial societies and lower back pain (LBP). The latter has proven to be a major cost to health services and private industry throughout the industrialised world and now represents a global health issue as recent WHO reports on obesity and LBP reveal. Thus far there have been few co-ordinated attempts to deal with the causes of the problem through public policy. Drawing upon a range of sources in anthropology, health studies, politics and economics, the paper argues that this a modern social problem rooted in the contingent conjuncture of natural and social causal mechanisms. The key question it raises is: what are the appropriate mechanisms for addressing this problem? This paper develops an analysis rooted in libertarian social theory and argues that both the state and the capitalist market are flawed mechanisms for resolving this problem. There remains a fundamental dilemma for libertarians, however. Whilst the state and the market may well be flawed mechanisms, they are the dominant ones shaping global political economy. To what extent can libertarians work within these structures and remain committed to libertarian goals?	1	Peter Wilkin
Herrick, Clare. 2009. 'Shifting Blame/selling Health: Corporate Social Responsibility in the Age of Obesity.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:1 51-65.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	9	This paper examines how and why health has become a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) strategy for the global food and drink industry (FDI) in the context of current governmental and public calls to address mounting obesity rates. It argues that, despite the current prominence of health within CSR, there has not been a reciprocal interest by those adopting sociological approaches to the study of health and illness in the implications of this strategic uptake of health or in the viability and legitimacy of the state's own public health role. This omission is addressed through an empirical exploration of three contentions: first, that health and wellbeing may be used to secure brand value and consumer goodwill at a time when mounting obesity rates demand new levels of accountability from the FDI. Secondly, that the food industry, through CSR, may promote a narrow epidemiological understanding of obesity, shifting blame from `foods' to `diet' and from `diet' to `sedentarism'. Thirdly, that CSR reporting and its associated practices have enabled the food industry to assume some responsibility for obesity prevention, thereby problematising the state's role in addressing its own `public health' crisis.	1	Clare Herrick

Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:1 66-80.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	24	This paper draws from a qualitative study of tobacco use by young women in Toronto, Canada. Narrative interviews were used to understand the multiple roles and functions of smoking within the everyday lives of female adolescents. Guided by a Bourdieusian theoretical framework this study employed the core construct of cultural capital in order to position tobacco and other substance use as field-specific capital that young women accumulate while navigating the social worlds of adolescence. Departing from the psychosocial or peer-influence models that inform the majority of tobacco research with young people, this analysis provides a nuanced understanding of how smoking, drinking, using drugs are much more than simple forms of teenage experimentation or rebellion, but can also serve as key resources for defining the self, acquiring status and making social distinctions within adolescent social worlds. In this context it is also argued that initiation into substance use practices is a way that young women demonstrate and develop social and cultural competencies.	3	Rebecca J. Haines; Blake D.

Kelly, Susan. 2009. 'Choosing Not to Choose: Reproductive Responses of Parents of Children With Genetic Conditions or Impairments.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:1 81-97.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	17	Parents of children with genetic conditions or impairments stand in a unique position with regard to choices and dilemmas posed by prenatal screening and testing options offered to at-risk parents as a means to a `healthy' baby. This article reports the results of a qualitative study of parents whose children are clients of a state-wide rural genetic outreach programme in the US. The analysis seeks to connect the lived experience of parents of children with genetic conditions or impairments to choices with which women are confronted as prenatal testing technologies continue to proliferate. It reports the finding that a majority of parents in the study chose not to choose: avoiding future pregnancies, declining prenatal testing for subsequent pregnancies, or limiting testing to `for information only'. These decisions do not reflect simple rejection of medical intervention, opposition to abortion, and/or affirmation of a positive parenting experience with an affected child. Rather, choosing to avoid the condition of choice appears to be a strategy of responsible parenting that emerges from ambivalence towards the options presented by reproductive technologies.	1	Susan E.

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	3	Tissue derived from the aborted fetus is considered `the right tool for the job' in some stem cell laboratories. Relatively little is known of the arrangements in Britain for sourcing aborted fetuses for research purposes. This paper uses data from interviews with stem cell scientists, policy makers, tissue bankers, sponsors of stem cell research, clinicians and nurses, and `pro-choice' and `pro-life' activists to reconstruct the work involved in reconfiguring an `unwanted' pregnancy into a source of fetal stem cells. A close scrutiny of the work allows the politics of collections to emerge. Aborted fetuses undergo a process of decorporealisation that enables scientists to claim them for their professional and economic advantage. The work, however, has consequences for women rhetorically through being reconfigured into a repository of usable fetal tissue, and, in some sites, materially, through alteration in method of abortion.	1	Naomi Pfeffer
Searle, Beverley, Susan Smith & Nicole Cook. 2009. 'From Housing Wealth to Well-being?.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:1 112-127.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	1	The positive health effects of owner-occupation, compared to renting, are well documented. But home ownership is itself heterogeneous, as is the health profile of its incumbents, and this is less well recognised. Drawing from a mixed-methods study, which includes 150 qualitative interviews with a cross-section of UK mortgage holders, this paper examines the health implications of a definitive feature of owned housing: its role as a financial tool. In particular, we ask whether there is anything about the process of accumulating wealth into housing or spending from this resource, that enhances well-being (or that adds to psycho-social stress). This question is timely, coming at the end of a long-wave of house-price appreciation, in a setting where it is easy to borrow from housing wealth, under a policy regime that looks increasingly to owned homes as an asset base for welfare. The answer casts light on whether, in what circumstances, to what extent, and by what mechanism, home ownership - the dominant housing tenure of the English-speaking world - might enhance the well-being of individuals, communities and societies.	3	Beverley A.

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	7	This article examines the everyday work of participating in pharmaceutical treatment for HIV infection in the context of urgent calls for adherence. Drawing on interviews and focus-group conversations with people taking antiretroviral drugs, the analysis explicates the work that goes into striving for adherence. What comes into view is a form of time work that brings about a temporary alignment between the inner experience of time, standard clock time, and the requirements of the medication schedule. Time work is largely cognitive; the pills, however, must actually be swallowed to complete the dose, occasioning, for some people, additional work to suppress or refashion emotional responses of anger and resistance. Both the time work and the emotional work of taking antiretroviral drugs draw people into forms of self work, including self-examination and self-adjustment, as they develop strategies for `doing adherence'.	1	Liza McCoy

Locating this analysis within the subculture of contemporary folk music, I demonstrate how song introductions can accomplish six important things: (1) provide an interpretive frame for understanding a performance, (2) cast performances in emotive terms, (3) situate performances in the larger context of marketing and sales, (4) contribute to moral entrepreneurial agendas, (5) align the performer's actions, and (6) offer a venue for making disclaimers. By demonstrating how performers accomplish these things. I locate song introductions within the larger context of situating public performances more generally.	1	Scott Grills
Schneider, Christopher. 2009. 'the Music Ringtone as an Identity Management Device: a Research Note.' Studies in Symbolic Interaction. 33:1 35-45.	Studies in Symbolic Interaction	2009	0	The mobile telephone is an omnipresent feature of daily life. Mobile phone technology was made readily available to the general public in the early 1980s. A ``ringtone'' is the sound broadcast from a mobile telephone indicating an incoming call. The ringtones of early 1980's mobile phones usually consisted of a few pre-programmed monophonic (single melodic line) sounds. These tones had no significance or practical use other than as indicators of social status (of having a mobile phone) and to alert the listener to an incoming call. The increasing popularity of ring! one ``realtones'' has prompted the need to empirically investigate the way these new technologies affect how people manage the impressions they make on others. Elaborating on Goffman's presentation of self-thesis, this research note establishes the importance of ringtone technology in situating youthful identities in contemporary society. Implications for future research are discussed.	1	Christopher J. Schneider
Robinson, Jude. 2009. 'There's No Place Like Home.' Studies in Symbolic Interaction. 33:1 47-57.	Studies in Symbolic Interaction	2009	2	The production of an ethnographic film offers a `way of seeing' for researchers exploring the lives of others, and one that remains open to further interpretation. The film Home, directed by Jeff Togman, documents a momentous 10 weeks in the lives of Sheree Farmer and Mary Abernathy, as they participate in a project designed to move selected families out of the Newark slums to new houses in a `better area'. Home also includes interviews with others concerned in the project, and images of the local area where the old and the new houses are located. What the film reveals is the complexity of the emotional and social, rather than simply the legal and economic, decision-making process surrounding the proposed move. It also shows how two people, depending on whether or not they are part of the dominant social group, can perceive an apparently golden and life-changing opportunity very differently. Ultimately, Home gives an insight into the lived experience of a lone mother's participation in a neighbourhood regeneration project, and powerfully calls into question the values that underpin much of our thinking about how problems of poverty and neighbourhood could, and should, be resolved.	1	Jude Robinson

Refining Simmel's analysis, I show flirtation as a way in which two time frames are continuously maintained within the same interaction. Rather than moving into a future interaction by using what I term ``actualization practices'' actions which thrust the present interaction into a future - interactants simultaneously use practices from both time frames, careful not to irrevocably shift the situation. The management of interactional ambiguity in flirtation is then analyzed as a key to examine other ambiguous or ``suspended'' interactions, where interactants must work to keep different potential future possibilities open.	1	Iddo Tavory

Studies in Symbolic Interaction	2009	1	Cinco de Mayo celebrations have become more popular in the United States than in Mexico. In the past few decades, this historic day has changed from a regional celebration of Mexican American culture into nationwide Latino/a holiday hijacked by the alcohol industry and other commercial interests. This chapter closely examines the varied ways in which Cinco de Mayo has been represented by U.S. advertisers, marketers, and restaurant owners. Using content analysis of Cinco de Mayo advertisements in magazines, billboards, liquor ads, and store displays from 2000 to 2006, five mediated representations emerged: Mexico's Fourth of July, Mexican St. Patrick's Day, Drink de Mayo, Sexism in a Bottle, and Mexican Otherness. These representations are anchored in a new racism ideology that emphasizes cultural difference, individualism, liberalism, and colorblindness, which reinforce existing racial inequalities. The implications of the alcohol industry's Cinco de Mayo advertisements is the increased targeting of Latino/a youth from working-class communities with high rates of alcohol-related violent deaths and illnesses.	1	Jose M.

Meltzer briefly reflects on what are the basic assumptions, foundational issues, and seminal concepts of symbolic interactionism (SI), a topic that Bernie and I discussed for nearly two decades. It reviews those concerns, but makes no attempt to survey the many varieties of SI. I center the rise of SI as one response to the nature-nurture controversy between 1870 and 1940. SI's response to that controversy emphasized the interaction of structure and agency through which humans are constructed by society as they are in the process of constructing it. A number of concerns defines the essentials of SI: behaviorism versus minded behavior; antideterminism, structure, and agency; chance and emergence: ontological and methodological implications; selves, language, and role-taking; and symbols, meaning, and transformation. I conclude with a comment on Meltzer's role in developing Central Michigan University as a regional center of SI.	1	Gil Richard Musolf
Woodward, Wayne. 2009. 'Communicative Sustainability: a Framework for Performance Accounting.' Studies in Symbolic Interaction. 33:1 327-345.	Studies in Symbolic Interaction	2009	0	The established role of communication in sustain ability studies is mainly to transmit information, about or for sustainability: disciplinary knowledge or mobilization of popular support. This chapter addresses the sustainability of communication itself, with a performance accounting framework for sustainability of organizational communication. The organizational emphasis derives from incorporating basic concepts from the work of James R. Taylor and the ``Montreal School'' approach to theorizing organizational communication. Communication as ``text'' (discursive formats and genres) and ``conversation'' (interactive, situational sense-making, and exchange) is assessed according to narrative and dramatistic logics in addition to instrumental ones; and sustainability standards are applied to ``triadic'' dimensions of communications: (1) the physical-artifactual substratum, or ``carriers'' of communication, including technologies, (2) symbolic forms that convey information, meanings, and ideologies, and (3) relations and interactions of communicative role-playing. The goal is to provide for sustainable knowledge, meaning, and participation mainly in organizational settings.	1	Wayne D. Woodward
Dirsmith, Mark, Sajay Samuel, Mark Covaleski & James Heian. 2009. 'the Inter-play of Power and Meta-power in the Social Construction of ``entrepreneurial'' Professional Services Firms: a Processual Ordering Perspective.' Studies in Symbolic Interaction. 33:1 347-387.	Studies in Symbolic Interaction	2009	0	The sociology of professions literature has theorized that the professions are undergoing a dramatic transformation from being traditional professions to ``entrepreneurial professions'' populated by ``knowledge workers.'' In part, this transformation is associated with the commodification and commercialization of professional endeavor. Our purpose is to enlist the processual ordering perspective to examine the ongoing transformation of the Big 5 (and following the collapse of Arthur Andersen during our field study) /4 public accounting firms to become entrepreneurial firms populated by global knowledge experts. More specifically, we focus on the inter-play of power and meta-power across three moments of the social construction process externalization, objectivation, and internalization through which the ethos of entrepreneurialism is being socially constructed within these firms, their individual members, and in the public accounting profession. Finally, we explore impressions gleaned from our qualitative, naturalistic field study.	4	Mark W. Dirsmith; Sajay Samuel; Mark A. Covaleski; James B. Heian
Katovich, Michael & Wesley Longhofer. 2009. 'Mystification of Rock.' Studies in Symbolic Interaction. 33:1 389-415.	Studies in Symbolic Interaction	2009	0	This chapter compares and contrasts the British invasion and punk rock as mystified, post-performance products. Expanding on Goffman's notion of mystification to discuss texts that emerged from performances and drawing on Mannheim's distinction between ideological and utopian perspectives, we discuss the British invasion as bound to elite interpretations of mystified products and punk rock as bound to more provincial and anti-elitist interpretations. We note that despite differences, both genres involve, to varying degrees, mystifying differences, mystifying legendary status, and mystifying popularity itself The discussion of both musical genres compliments and affirms previous analyses, especially the analysis of punk rock as a dramaturgical and utopian version of play.	2	Michael A.

Young, Robert. 2009. 'Narrative Form and Temporality in Public Discourse: Romance, Tragedy, and America's Presence in Iraq.' Studies in Symbolic Interaction. 33:1 417-441.	Studies in Symbolic Interaction	2009	0	This chapter investigates the use of prospective (i.e., future oriented) narratives as rhetorical devices in public discourse. Drawing on recent narrative research and Northrop Frye's discussion of generic narrative forms in literature, I contrast the classic Romantic Narrative of America's occupation of Iraq presented in President Bush's State of the Union Addresses (SUAs) over the last 6 years of his presidency with the alternative narrative projected in the Democratic Party's formal responses to those addresses. My analysis demonstrates how Bush's story of America's actions in Iraq was constructed through the course of those speeches by exploiting both narrative form and temporality and how it constrained the articulation of counter narratives by the Democrats. The results support the general thesis that, by virtue of a neo-rhetoric centered around strategic frames and culturally resonant narratives, the Bush Administration in particular and conservatives in general successfully dictated public discourse on important national issues.	1	Robert L.

Harris, Scott. 2009. 'Four Ethnomethodological Paradoxes: Reflections on the Work of Kenneth Liberman.' Studies in Symbolic Interaction. 33:1 443-457.	Studies in Symbolic Interaction	2009	0	This chapter summarizes and explicates the work of Kenneth Liberman, an exemplary but underappreciated practitioner of ethnomethodology for the past 30 years. Four paradoxes or tensions organize the discussion. First, Liberman is highly confident that confidence is almost always unwarranted. Second. Liberman is extremely skeptical yet respectful of ordinary knowledge and practices. Third, Liberman insists that meaning is not inherent even while he tries to faithfully study and represent reality. Fourth, Liberman attempts to do work that benefits various individuals and groups, but he believes that the self is illusory and that social problems are interpretations. These four themes are common (but not universal) in ethnomethodological scholarship. Consequently, Liberman's work can be used as an instructive point of entry into that form of inquiry.	1	Scott R.

Dandaneau, Steven. 2009. 'Sisyphus Had It Easy: Reflections of Two Decades of Teaching the Sociological Imagination.' Teaching Sociology. 37:1 8-19.	Teaching Sociology	2009	5	The Sociological Imagination is among the most recognized books in the history of American Sociology. Yet, the sociological imagination as such, a radical form of self-consciousness, is not commonly well understood nor easily acquired. This essay examines the challenges thus faced by instructors who seek to accurately impart what Mills meant by his famous neologism and the even stiffer challenge for those struggling to instill the sociological imagination in their students. Two pertinent examples of creative and probably productive pedagogy are discussed, Maurice R. Stein's ``Sociology of Birth \& Death'' at Brandeis University and Brian Rich's senior seminar in sociology at Transylvania University. The essay concludes with advice for the instructor in pursuit of fidelity to Mills's original argument and guidance vis-a-vis the typical constraints encountered in today's classrooms.	1	Steven P.

Teaching Sociology	2009	1	Although much has been written in the oast 50 years about the pedagogical value of The Sociological Imagination, one section of Mills's book has been underutilized for far too long. Namely, the essay in the appendix, ``On Intellectual Craftsmanship,'' has been rarely invoked by sociologists discussing the significance of The Sociological Imagination for teaching and learning, Given that the appendix is explicitly about doing research and engaging in the scholarly process, this oversight may be understandable; however, we argue that there is much to be found in the appendix that serves the needs of teachers and learners alike. The purpose of this paper is to highlight some of the pedagogical insights that are implicit in Mills'S recommendations for being intellectual craftspersons.	2	Peter Kaufman; Todd Schoepflin
Storrs, Debbie. 2009. 'Teaching Mills in Tokyo: Developing a Sociological Imagination Through Storytelling.' Teaching Sociology. 37:1 31-46.	Teaching Sociology	2009	1	Here I emphasize the applicability of the sociological imagination to an international audience by sharing my journey of teaching sociology in Japan. I found my own sociological imagination helpful in critically evaluating the literature on Japanese higher education and the construction of the Japanese student as a form of Orientalism. As I embraced international students' unique, context-specific capacities for learning, I relied on the illuminating power of C. Wright Mills's sociological imagination to heighten their understandings of themselves and others. Despite the characterization of Japanese students as passive learners, I discovered an engaged and responsive student body who developed a keen sociological imagination through storytelling. Employing a pedagogy of storytelling, I helped my students successfully explore gender and ethnic troubles as public issues in a global context. The insight gained abroad has led me to expand my pedagogy at home beyond active learning strategies to incorporate stories to enhance U.S. students' sociological imaginations.	1	Debbie Storrs
Hoop, Katrina. 2009. 'Students' Lived Experiences as Text in Teaching the Sociological Imagination.' Teaching Sociology. 37:1 47-60.	Teaching Sociology	2009	6	Although we may claim our students are developing a sociological imagination, it is quite another to realize this in our teaching and our students' performances. Through a professional move from teaching in Chicago to Maine, I was led to rethink how I teach the sociological imagination. I argue that if we are to teach the sociological imagination, we must consider our students' contextual backgrounds more carefully and use student's lived experiences as ``text'' from which they exercise and develop their sociological imaginations. I illustrate this approach with an assignment designed to use students' experiences from rural and small towns in Maine. The assignment challenges them to use their sociological perspective to look at the relationship between ``private troubles'' and ``public issues,'' and to demonstrate using a sociological imagination to reflect on their biographies.	1	Katrina C.

Wright Mills's Friendly Critique of Service Learning and an Innovative Response: Cross-institutional Collaborations for Community-based Research.' Teaching Sociology. 37:1 61-75.	Teaching Sociology	2009	4	C. Wright Mills would be a friendly critic of service learning, acknowledging its benefits for providing students with experiential learning opportunities to connect personal troubles with social issues. Yet he would be critical of service-learning practices that perpetuate institutional power inequalities and that do not advance the social change objectives of community-based organizations. We offer an innovative approach that helps to address some of these concerns which, when used in conjunction with ``best practices'' of service learning, has the potential to make a greater impact on the community than most service-learning projects. This paper highlights how two sociology programs in two urban universities-a large, elite university and a smaller, minority-serving university-have completed significant community-based research projects by having classes of students at both universities work on projects both consecutively and simultaneously across several semesters to complete substantial research projects with and for community partners. We use a case study approach to identify five key practices that have enabled the two universities to effectively collaborate across institutions,	3	Sam Marullo; Roxanna Moayedi; Deanna Cooke
Hironimus-Wendt, Robert & Lora Wallace. 2009. 'the Sociological Imagination and Social Responsibility.' Teaching Sociology. 37:1 76-88.	Teaching Sociology	2009	3	In this paper, we maintain that sociologists should deliberately teach social responsibility as a means of fulfilling the promise that C. Wright Mills envisioned. A key aspect of the sociological imagination includes a sense of social responsibility, but that aspect is best learned through a combination of experience and academic knowledge. Students gain the fullest sense of the sociological imagination, one that includes social responsibility, when they are able to have encounters and experiences that challenge their pre-existing world-views and allow them to see first-hand the sociological concepts they learn in the classroom. Further, we argue that teaching social responsibility is appropriate because it has deep roots in the discipline. We identify the origins of the active learning model in sociological theory and provide examples of the ways in which social responsibility is realized through service learning experiences of our students.	2	Robert J.

Finkelstein, Marv. 2009. 'Toward Teaching a Liberating Sociological Practicality: Challenges for Teaching, Learning and Practice.' Teaching Sociology. 37:1 89-102.	Teaching Sociology	2009	1	Though C. Wright Mills made a pivotal contribution to the discipline by raising sociologists' awareness of the ideological and bureaucratic content of sociological practicality, he may have placed unyielding limits on ``the promise'' he profoundly proclaimed in the ``sociological imagination.'' By defining types of practicality in such rigidly confining terms, as either ``liberal'' or ``illiberal'' those wishing to practice sociology in broader and more expansive ways were left with few of the alternatives Mills himself wished to extol. Over the past generation, the field of applied sociology and teaching and learning sociological practice have struggled to develop in the discipline. This has posed huge challenges for teachers wishing to address the needs of students who have perennially been interested in finding practical possibilities for applying their sociology in jobs and careers. The purpose of this paper is to: 1) examine the concept of sociological practicality propounded by Mills; 2) critically assess the concept of sociological practicality in the historical context of American sociology, 3) identify and discuss a broad typology of models of research and practice from which types of practicality may emerge; 4) discuss the implications of this typology for teaching and learning sociological practice; and 5) conclude by discussing ways of teaching a liberating practicality for sociology.	1	Marv Finkelstein
Hansen, Randall. 2009. 'the Poverty of Postnationalism: Citizenship, Immigration, and the New Europe.' Theory and Society. 38:1 1-24.	Theory and Society	2009	13	Over the last decade and a half, in a literature otherwise obsessed with citizenship in all its forms, a broad array of scholars has downplayed, criticized, and at times trivialized national citizenship. The assault on citizenship has had both an expansionary and a contractionary thrust. It is expansionary in that the language of citizenship is no longer linked with nationality, but rather protest politics. An earlier generation of social scientists would have described these actions as lobbying; they have now become ``citizenship practice.'' It is contractionary in that what one might have thought to be the core of citizenship; nationality, the possession of a nation-state's passport is viewed as less and less relevant to citizenship. Scholars have dislodged both the substance of citizenship, what it is, and the location of citizenship, where it ``happens,'' from the nation-state and national citizenship. The article challenges this devaluation of citizenship and the nation-state on empirical, conceptual, and normative grounds. Empirically, scholars, whom I link together under the umbrella term ``postnationalists,'' have based their anti-statist arguments on evidence that, when subjected to further inspection, wholly fails to support the arguments advanced. Conceptually, postnationalists rely on categories that are confused and untenable, being that national variables are cited as evidence of transnational developments. Normatively, postnationalists have lost the emancipatory thrust that once gave concerns with citizenship real-world purchase.	1	Randall Hansen
Kittikhoun, Anoulak. 2009. 'Small State, Big Revolution: Geography and the Revolution in Laos.' Theory and Society. 38:1 25-55.	Theory and Society	2009	1	Extant theoretical insights-mostly derived from studies of prominent revolutions in large countries-are less useful when applied to the unfolding of revolutions in small states. To understand why revolutions happened in the latter, a framework is needed that takes into account geography. For small states, geography is more than dotted lines on maps. It is the source of intervention and vulnerability. Deeply mired in history and memory, states' geographies shape their distinctive identities and have great impacts on national political trajectories, including revolutions. Thus, to provide understanding of revolutions in these countries, no analysis could be complete without taking into account their places, understood in physical, ideational, and historical terms, within their regions and the world. The case of Laos is used to suggest a geographical analysis of revolutions that provides overlooked insights into the origins, processes, and outcomes of revolutions in small, vulnerable states.	1	Anoulak Kittikhoun
Gates, Leslie. 2009. 'Theorizing Business Power in the Semiperiphery: Mexico 1970-2000.' Theory and Society. 38:1 57-95.	Theory and Society	2009	4	This study explains why the power of neoliberal business over the Mexican state increased during the last three decades of the twentieth century. It identifies three sources of increased neoliberal business power that occurred in conjunction with neoliberal reforms: (1) active mobilization by neoliberal business, (2) increased access to the state by neoliberal business, and (3) increased economic power of neoliberal business. It thereby contributes additional evidence that counters the view of Mexico's state neoliberalizers as acting autonomously from business. It further outlines two conditions that were instrumental in bringing about the increased power of neoliberal business: the onset of economic crisis in the 1970s, and a shift in foreign capital preferences in Mexico. The analysis demonstrates how Mexico's sources and conditions of business power differed from those in advanced industrial societies, and outlines why the Mexican case may be a good starting point for devising a historically-contingent theory of business power in the semiperiphery.	1	Leslie C.

The recent publication of Viviana Zelizer's The Purchase of Intimacy (2005a) is therefore an excellent opportunity to review the general trend of her work Zelizer 1979, 1985, 1994, and contrast her leading ideas to the central thesis that gives Polanyi's work its particular flavor: the danger encapsulated in the use of modern money and the functioning of the market system.	1	Philippe Steiner

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	5	This article documents the process by which a police academy staff generates an interaction order of obedience to authority during recruit training. Specifically, it examines the formal pattern of face-to-face interaction that recruits are expected to embrace before they can engage the larger occupational culture. The staff utilizes a dialectical method akin to Braithwaite's model of reintegrative shaming in which recruits are simultaneously degraded for what are defined as highly stigmatic civilian characteristics and offered a status elevation for the excision of these problematic attributes. Subscription to or deviance from established rituals is taken as evidence of personal character and assists in driving recruits through a moral career, in which they can evolve to an idealized status of police officer.	1	Norman Conti

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	12	The association between marital status and health among men has been well documented, but few studies track health trajectories following family structure transitions among unmarried fathers. Using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study this article examines trajectories of paternal mental health and sef-rated health, focusing on transitions into and out of residential relationships with the child biological mother or a new partner during a five-year post-birth period (N = 4,331). Continuously married fathers report higher time-specific sef-rated health and fewer mental health problems than continuously single fathers, controlling for underlying health trajectories. The disparity, however, does not increase over time, providing little support for the marital resource model during these years. Static group differences suggest that resources fathers carry with them into unions may buffer them from the negative effects of union dissolution. The implications of these findings for cohabitation, as well as selection and causation arguments, are also discussed.	1	Sarah O. Meadows

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	7	In the United States, a woman health insurance coverage is largely determined by her employment and marital roles. This research evaluates competing hypotheses regarding how the combination of employment and marital roles shapes insurance coverage among Mexican-origin, non-Hispanic white, and African American women. We use data from the 2004 and 2006 March Supplements to the Current Population Surveys. Results show that these roles largely substitute for each other among non-Hispanic white and African American women, although marriage generally increases the odds of coverage slightly more than employment among non-Hispanic white women. In contrast, these roles cumulatively increase those odds among Mexican-origin women. Yet neither employment, nor marriage, nor their combination assures their coverage. Married Mexican-origin women are particularly disadvantaged. As women increasingly spend a smaller fraction of their lives in marriage, and as relatively few women are in benefits-rich occupations, stable and equitable coverage may require a universal health insurance system.	3	Jennifer Karas Montez; Jacqueline L.

Song, Lijun & Nan Lin. 2009. 'Social Capital and Health Inequality: Evidence From Taiwan.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:2 149-163.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	19	Does social capital, resources embedded in social relationships, influence health? This research examines whether social capital impacts depressive symptoms and overall perceived health status over and above the effects of social support. Our analyses use unique data from the Taiwan Social Change Survey collected in 1997, and measures social capital and social support through two network instruments (the position generator and the name generator). Results replicate the effects of social support, as measured through the name generator on both outcomes. Results show that social capital, as measured through the position generator has direct effects on both outcomes net of social support, while social support is a stronger predictor than social capital. This research indicates that social capital contributes to health beyond and distinct from the contribution of social support, and it suggests that social capital and social support are two independent relationship-based causes of disease which require different instruments of measurement.	2	Lijun Song; Nan Lin

'Acculturation and Substance Use: Social Influence as a Mediator Among Hispanic Alternative High School Youth.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:2 164-179.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	6	Research suggests that acculturation increases the risk of substance use among Hispanic youth. However this process is not well understood. This study examined associations between acculturation and several substance use indicators among a sample of 714 Hispanic youth attending alternative high schools in southern California. Peer social influence was assessed as a potential mediator Acculturation, measured by language use, was associated with increased risk of lifetime alcohol, marijuana, and current alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, and hard drug use, controlling for age, socioeconomic status, and gender Results of mediation analyses indicate that peer social influence mediated the relationship between acculturation and lifetime alcohol, and current alcohol, cigarettes, and hard drug use. Evidence for partial mediation was observed with lifetime and current marijuana use. These results provide evidence that peer social influence is an important mediating variable that should be considered when examining the relationship between acculturation and substance use.	6	Raquel Myers; Chih-Ping Chou; Steve Sussman; Lourdes Baezconde-Garbanati; Harry Pachon; Thomas W.

Hierarchical Logistic Models are implemented to analyze two waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Findings show that personal religiosity is unrelated to reported abortion behavior However conservative Protestants appear less likely to obtain abortions than mainline Protestants, Catholics, and women of non-Christian faiths. Regardless of personal religious affiliation, having attended a school with a high proportion of conservative Protestants appears to discourage abortion as women enter their twenties. Conversely, women from private religious high schools appear more likely to report obtaining an abortion than women from public schools.	1	Amy Adamczyk

Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:2 196-212.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	13	Recognizing religiosity and spirituality as related yet distinct phenomena, and conceptualizing psychological well-being as a multidimensional construct, this study examines whether individuals frequency of formal religious participation and spiritual perceptions are independently associated with diverse dimensions of psychological well-being (negative affect, positive affect, purpose in life, positive relations with others, personal growth, self-acceptance, environmental mastery, and autonomy). Data came from 1,564 respondents in the 2005 National Survey of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS). Higher levels of spiritual perceptions were independently associated with better psychological wellbeing across all dimensions, and three of these salutary associations were stronger among women than men. Greater formal religious participation was independently associated only with more purpose in life and (among older adults) personal growth; greater formal religious participation was also associated with less autonomy. Overall, results suggest a different pattern of independent linkages between formal religious participation and spiritual perceptions across diverse dimensions of psychological well-being.	3	Emily A.

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	14	In this article, I argue that the relationships among mental health, disorder and distress are a key source of conflict in the sociology of mental health and that the features of the conflict have the potential to call into question much of the accumulated scientific knowledge on mental health. To address this issue, I attempt to empirically assess three competing frameworks regarding these relationships: (1) the ``modal perspective,'' (2) the ``Mirowsky and Ross perspective,'' and (3) the ``positive psychology perspective.'' Results, however support a ``discontinuous perspective:'' no underlying continuum among any of the three concepts. These results suggest that researchers need to avoid the common practice of ``lumping together'' distress, disorder and mental health and study each in their own right. Subsequent tests attempt to further specify the relationships among these concepts. Results indicate a strong positive directional association from distress to disorder a strong negative directional association from distress to mental health, and no significant relationship between mental health and disorder These results are used to generate a number of directions for future research.	1	Andrew R.

Olafsdottir, Sigrun & Bernice Pescosolido. 2009. 'Drawing the Line: the Cultural Cartography of Utilization Recommendations for Mental Health Problems.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:2 228-244.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	14	In the 1990s, sociologists began to rethink the failure of utilization models to explain whether and why individuals accessed formal treatment systems. This effort focused on reconceptualizing the underlying assumptions and processes that shaped utilization patterns. While we have built a better understanding of how social networks structure pathways to care and how disadvantaged sociocultural groups face substantial barriers to treatment, we have less understanding of the larger cultural context in which individuals recognize and respond to symptoms. Drawing from recent innovations in the sociology of culture, we develop the concept of ``cultural mapping'' to describe if and how individuals discriminate among different available sources of formal treatment. Using data from the 1996 Mental Health Module of the General Social Survey, we compare Americans' willingness to recommend providers in the general medical and specialty mental health sectors. The results indicate that, despite unrealistically high levels of endorsement, individuals do discriminate between providers based on their evaluation of the problem, underlying causes, and likely consequences. While perceived severity leads individuals to suggest any type of formal care, problems attributed to biological causes are directed to general or specialty medical providers (doctors, psychiatrists, and hospitals); those matching symptoms for schizophrenia or seen as eliciting violence are allocated to the specialty mental health sector (psychiatry, mental hospital); and those seen as being caused by stress are sent to nonmedical mental health providers (i.e., counselors). These findings help to explain inconsistencies in previous utilization studies, and they suggest the critical importance of maintaining a dialogue between medical sociology and the sociology of culture.	2	Sigrun Olafsdottir; Bernice A.

I address the question from a social structural perspective, reassessing the evidence and reconsidering the key concept of brokerage. The analysis show that these men were bridges par excellence, spanning the various social chasms and connecting disparate organizational elements of the movement, thus bringing together ``men of all orders'' to forge an emerging movement.	1	Shin-Kap Han

Mobilization	2009	4	Social movement campaigns help create the networks and collective identities needed to build social movement communities, which in turn support subsequent collective campaigns. This article examines the interactions between movement communities and campaigns using the case of the 2000 World March of Women in Montreal. We find that movement community resources and networks, mobilized by leaders in stable movement organizations and institutions, support campaigns. Centralization, diversity, and size of movement communities affect campaign mobilization. Movement campaigns alter movement communities by creating bonds that form the basis for subsequent campaigns and by keeping movement communities politicized. Prior campaigns generate public consciousness, put issues on the public agenda, create new frames and discourse, forge connections to new constituents, and leave behing new networks, coalition organizations, leaders, and activists. Our research contributes to an understanding of the connections between the submerged networks of social movement communities and the contentious politics of movement campaigns.	2	Suzanne Staggenborg; Josee Lecomte
Fitzgerald, Scott. 2009. 'Cooperative Collective Action: Framing Faith-based Community Development.' Mobilization. 14:2 181-198.	Mobilization	2009	1	Drawing from social movement and organization theories, data from an in-depth comparative analysis of three faith-based community development organizations (FBCDOs) in the United States are examined as a form of cooperative collective action. The diagnostic, prognostic, and motivational frames produced by each organisation, and the role these frames play in developing and maintaining relationships with the state, are detailed. These collective action frames (1) link sectarian religious values to broad community development goals, and (2) do not fundamentally challenge the prevailing economic and political systems. Empirically, the findings clarify important issues and dynamics related to emerging movements, the modern welfare state, and church-state relations by specifying how values, beliefs, and structural location shape the actions of FBCDOs engaged in state-sponsored religious social service provision. Theoretically, it demonstrates the utility of more precise analytical distinctions between types of collective action and suggests new directions for research on movements for change.	1	Scott T.

Friedman, Eli. 2009. 'External Pressure and Local Mobilization: Transnational Activism and the Emergence of the Chinese Labor Movement.' Mobilization. 14:2 199-218.	Mobilization	2009	4	This article elucidates connections between two strategies of transnational social movements-external pressure and local mobilization-and two potential outcomes paternalism and psychological empowerment. Application of this, theoretical framework to the nascent Chinese labor movement indicates that an overreliance on an external-pressure approach results in paternalism, thereby precluding psychological empowerment for aggrieved actors and potentially inhibiting movement growth. Conversely, strategies that relegate external support to a secondary role and privilege local mobilization are more likely to result in psychological empowerment. In this study, I argue that psychological empowerment is a prerequisite for the emergence of a worker-based movement in China. Many studies of cooperation between movement actors from the global North and South have seen this relationship as essentially unproblematic. I begin to problematize the inherent power inequalities between the two sets of actors and will theorize the implications for movement emergence in Southern countries.	1	Eli Friedman
Alimi, Eitan. 2009. 'Mobilizing Under the Gun: Theorizing Political Opportunity Structure in a Highly Repressive Setting.' Mobilization. 14:2 219-237.	Mobilization	2009	10	Although episodes of contentions politics in undemocratic regimes constitute the lions share of contentious political events worldwide. the theorizing of political opportunity structures is based largely, on contentious episodes in democratic/liberal political settings. This anomaly hampers recent attempts to redefine the boundaries among episodes of contention across time and place. Employing the case of the first Plaestinian Intifada (1987-1992). I critically examine three examine three theoretical aspects of political opportunity structures (POS).- (1) how the link between POS, strateg, and tactics is forged; (2) how different levels of POS interact: and (3) the ability of multiactor movements to cope with the shifting nature of POS. I conclude by briefly illustrating the relevance of my findings to other structurally similar cases. and discuss the implications of my analysis for further sensitization of the Dynamics of Contention research program.	1	Eitan Y.

Sullivan, Richard. 2009. 'Density Matters: the Union Density Bias and Its Implications for Labor Movement Revitalization.' Mobilization. 14:2 239-260.	Mobilization	2009	4	After more than a decade of analyzing efforts to revitalize the U.S. labor movement, many have concluded that organized labor must become a movement again. Nevertheless, most analyses remain based on the traditional view that labor powere is derived solely from the portion of the labor market that is unionized. This fact is illustrated by the continued use of union density as the primary means of assessing labor movement strength. this article examines this ``density bias'' and ways that it constraints analyses of labor revitalization-obscuring alternative sources of movement power, excluding community based labor organizations, and oversimplifying assessments of organizing processes. The article highlights the need for a critical assessment of conventional wisdom in labor studies and argues that treating labor as a social movement may generate new research questions and move theorizing in promising new directions.	1	Richard Sullivan
Notten, Natascha & Gerbert Kraaykamp. 2009. 'Parents and the Media a Study of Social Differentiation in Parental Media Socialization.' Poetics. 37:3 185-200.	Poetics	2009	6	In this study we analysed the effects of parental social background and family composition on various types of parental media socialization. We employed the Family Survey Dutch Population 1998, 2000 and 2003 (N = 2608), and analysed respondents' reports of socialization practices in their parental home. Respondents from high-status families report more extensive parental media socialization in all highbrow and guidance activities. In contrast, a parental example of popular television viewing is reported less often by children from the higher social strata. Family composition also affects parental media socialization practices. Parental media guidance takes place less frequently in families that have experienced a divorce and in larger families. Finally, parental highbrow media consumption evidently causes more parental media guidance, therefore interpreting a substantial part of the effects of parental social background.	2	Natascha Notten; Gerbert Kraaykamp
Lee, Elizabeth & Grace Kao. 2009. 'Less Bang for the Buck? Cultural Capital and Immigrant Status Effects on Kindergarten Academic Outcomes.' Poetics. 37:3 201-226.	Poetics	2009	2	Using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), a nationally representative sample of kindergarteners in 1998-99, we examine how participation in extracurricular activities varies by race and immigrant status. While all minority children have lower levels of participation, we find that Asian, Hispanic, and Black children of immigrants are particularly disadvantaged even after accounting for differences in parent income and educational background. Teachers rate non-White children of immigrants lower on reading test scores even after controlling for their socioeconomic status and their test scores. Surprisingly, Asian children of immigrants fare especially badly, in contrast to often-cited academic successes for this group. Teacher evaluations of reading ability are also correlated with some forms of extracurricular activity participation, even after adjusting for children's test scores. Results suggest modest interaction effects between immigrant status and cultural capital within racial groups. We conclude that teachers may use evidence of activity participation to signal academic mobility and promise but that these effects vary by race and immigrant status.	2	Elizabeth M. Lee; Grace Kao
Tepper, Steven & Eszter Hargittai. 2009. 'Pathways to Music Exploration in a Digital Age.' Poetics. 37:3 227-249.	Poetics	2009	3	This paper looks at the largely unexplored terrain of how young people find music that is new to them in an environment with an unprecedented number of possibilities. Digital media has changed not only how artists create and distribute content, but also how listeners find and access new material. The new options exist in the context of older traditions such as using one's social networks or traditional media to find content. Based on original data with a sample of college students, we find that while students use digital media to find music new to them, social networks and traditional media continue to play a very important role in the course of exploration. We also find that digital technology is used differently by different types of music consumers and draw distinctions between peer-to-peer services and browsing, with the former more likely to be used by students from higher socio-economic backgrounds who are opinion leaders in the realm of music. We conclude with observations about the nature of opinion leadership and music and argue that future research should examine more closely the links among the discovery and sharing of culture, opinion leadership and social recognition and status.	2	Steven J.

Poetics	2009	4	Empirical research on the career development of pop musicians is scarce. In the present study three sets of factors that have been posited to determine musicians' career achievement were tested: background characteristics, personal attributes and the professional environment of pop musicians. A group of aspiring, professional Dutch pop musicians (N = 340) responded to online questionnaires. Regression analysis showed that social support and a professional attitude were positively associated with career success, and conscientiousness negatively. Most important, the professional context, i.e., having a website dedicated to the musician or act, and having access to professionals in the music industry, emerged as the strongest predictors of career success. Surprisingly, we found that self-perceived musical talent was not linked to career success. The limitations of our study and implications for future research are discussed.	3	Koos Zwaan; Tom F.

Accominotti, Fabien. 2009. 'Creativity From Interaction: Artistic Movements and the Creativity Careers of Modern Painters.' Poetics. 37:3 267-294.	Poetics	2009	6	This article revisits David W. Galenson's work on the relationship between artistic creativity and the life cycle of artists. Galenson introduces a simple classification of creativity careers (early vs. late-bloomers), relates it to a bipartite typology of creativity (conceptual vs. experimental innovators) and builds on this typology to explain the decreasing trend of age at which artists were most creative over several generations in the 19th and 20th centuries. Drawing on Galenson's measures, the present paper uses a different approach to overcome possible criticisms to his design. Applying sequence analysis to creativity careers of 41 major modern painters, it also yields a fairly different story from the one Galenson proposes. In particular, I show that a typology of creativity should distinguish between creativity occurring within artistic movements and other forms of creativity. This distinction is important, for the decrease in age at peak creativity over time seems actually driven by the evolution of movement-related creativity alone. Investigating the specific issue of creativity over the life cycle of artists, and showing that movements and interactions play an important part in the picture, the paper thus suggests there is something more than the mere individual involved in artistic creativity.	1	Fabien Accominotti
Zabel, Cordula. 2009. 'Eligibility for Maternity Leave and First Birth Timing in Great Britain.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:3 251-270.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	1	This paper examines the impact of maternity leave legislation on first birth timing in Great Britain. When maternity leave was introduced in Great Britain in 1976, the eligibility requirement for full-time employees was to have been working for the same employer for at least 2 years. Using data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), this paper examines whether women postponed first birth in accordance with tenure requirements for maternity leave. Higher transition rates to first birth are found for those who had acquired enough employer tenure to qualify for maternity leave than for those who did not yet qualify. However, the causal role of maternity leave legislation for first birth timing is uncertain, since transition rates to first birth began to diverge by employer tenure even before 1976.	1	Cordula Zabel
Albuquerque, P.. 2009. 'the Elderly and the Extended Household in Portugal: an Age-period-cohort Analysis.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:3 271-289.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	2	Portugal, a southern European country, is expected to exhibit a relatively large proportion of extended households. However, following some general trends associated with large social transformations, Portugal is also expected to have an increasingly larger proportion of nuclear families. We use data from the eight waves of ECHP (European Community Household Panel), covering the years from 1994 to 2001, to establish whether these expectations are justified. Among the nuclear households that include elderly members, we isolate those corresponding to single-person households, since they are particularly relevant for policy purposes. Separate analyses are carried out for the elderly with health problems and for those with no health problems, in order to detect different patterns of living arrangements. We also project the living arrangements until 2005, based on an age-period-cohort analysis. We find that the extended households are a very significant form of living arrangement with reference to the Portuguese elderly, and a living arrangement whose importance is not declining over time. In particular, the oldest old constitutes the group that tends to be found living most frequently in extended households, while those with health problems start much earlier than those with no health problems to live in extended households as they grow older. The proportion of individuals aged 65+ living alone has somewhat decreased, but the proportion of this type of household largely increases with age.	1	P. C. Albuquerque
Barbieri, Alisson, David Carr & Richard Bilsborrow. 2009. 'Migration Within the Frontier: the Second Generation Colonization in the Ecuadorian Amazon.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:3 291-320.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	10	Since the 1970s, migration to the Amazon has led to a growing human presence and resulting dramatic changes in the physical landscape of the Northern Ecuadorian Amazon frontier, including considerable deforestation. Over time, a second demographic phenomenon has emerged with the children of the original migrants leaving settler farms to set out on their own. The vast majority have remained in the Amazon region, some contributing to further changes in land use via rural-rural migration to establish new farms and others to incipient urbanization. This paper uses longitudinal, multi-scale data on settler colonists between 1990 and 1999 to analyze rural-rural and rural-urban migration among second-generation colonists within the region. Following a description of migrants and settlers in terms of their individual, household and community characteristics, a multinomial discrete-time hazard model is used to estimate the determinants of out-migration of the second generation settlers to both urban and rural areas. We find significant differences in the determinants of migration to the two types of destinations in personal characteristics, human capital endowments, stage of farm and household lifecycles, migration networks, and access to community resources and infrastructure. The paper concludes with a discussion of policy implications of migrants' choice of rural versus urban destinations.	3	Alisson Flavio Barbieri; David L. Carr; Richard E. Bilsborrow

Population Research and Policy Review	2009	12	Using geo-linked data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics and the decennial census, we compare probabilities of neighborhood out-migration for Anglos, blacks, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans, and Cubans by varying ethno-racial neighborhood compositions. Analyses for Latinos are disaggregated by nativity status. The results indicate that Anglos have a higher likelihood of moving when they have many minority neighbors and there is little difference whether minority neighbors are black or Latino. Among minorities there is some evidence of ``minority flight'' from whiter neighborhoods. Cubans, especially foreign-born Cubans, demonstrate the strongest propensity to flee neighborhoods with large black populations, whereas the probability of moving out decreases for Mexicans and Puerto Ricans when their neighbors are more likely to be black. Ethno-racial neighborhood composition has little effect on blacks' decision to leave their neighborhood.	3	Jeremy F. Pais; Scott J. South; Kyle Crowder
Harknett, Kristen. 2009. 'Why Are Children With Married Parents Healthier? the Case of Pediatric Asthma.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:3 347-365.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	9	Among a recent birth cohort in U.S. cities, young children were far more likely to be diagnosed with asthma and to experience an asthma-related emergency if their parents were unmarried. Using longitudinal data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, I find that the child health benefits of marriage seem to stem from the benefits of parental coresidence and the demographic and socioeconomic correlates of marriage. Children whose parents live apart appear to be at heightened risk of asthma even after taking into account demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. The child health benefits of marriage are only weakly related to mothers' health behaviors and are not related to father involvement. An analysis of relationship transitions suggests that marital disruption may be more harmful for children than the disruption of cohabiting unions. The results provide some cautions and considerations for the U.S. government's Healthy Marriage Initiative.	1	Kristen Harknett
Fan, Lida. 2009. 'Measuring Interprovincial Flows of Human Capital in China: 1995-2000.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:3 367-387.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	1	This study measures the consequences of interprovincial migration in China in terms of the flows of human beings and the flows of human capital using two micro datasets. First, this study uses a household income survey dataset to estimate the earning returns to education as one of the two measurements of human capital. Then, the micro-dataset of the 2000 Chinese Census is used to calculate the flows of human capital among provinces by using the results from the estimation of human capital. The flows of human capital are then compared to the flows of human beings to see whether they go in the same directions and to the same extent. The results indicate that although in most of the cases, the flows of human beings and the flows of human capital are in the same directions, there are some cases that a province experienced a loss in human beings but a net gain in human capital, or vice versa. Second, some provinces are more adversely affected by the flows of human capital than others, which may not be seen by merely examining the flows of human beings. Third, non-hukou migration is different from hukou migration in volume, in scope of both gains and losses of human beings and human capital, and in directions for some provinces. Finally, we can conclude that measuring the flows of human capital is a useful way to observe how migration affects the potential of regional distribution of development.	1	Lida Fan
Benzecry, Claudio. 2009. 'Becoming a Fan: on the Seductions of Opera.' Qualitative Sociology. 32:2 131-151.	Qualitative Sociology	2009	7	The following is a sociological report on a particular segment of an opera audience. Its purpose is to explicate the processes of initiation in an activity typically considered ``high culture.'' It differs from other accounts of cultural consumption in that it is concerned not with the correspondence between social background and taste, but with the processes whereby taste is assembled. Drawing upon an 18-month-long ethnography on opera fans in Buenos Aires, this paper has two aims. First, it shows that passionate opera fans enjoy opera based on their belief that opera is something that needs to be learned in order to be properly enjoyed. Second, it describes three diverse instances in which people learn about opera. Furthermore, this paper also has a theoretical objective: to extend and refine the classic model of affiliation and initiation into cultural practices established by Howard Becker with his case study of marijuana use.	1	Claudio E.

Hackstaff, Karla. 2009. 'Who Are We? Genealogists Negotiating Ethno-racial Identities.' Qualitative Sociology. 32:2 173-194.	Qualitative Sociology	2009	0	This paper analyzes how ethno-racial standpoints influence the ways that genealogists negotiate and narrate biological and/or social interpretations of family and social history. A constructivist methodological approach grounds the analysis of three family genealogists who all have African and European lineages, but differ in their current ethno-racial identities. These case studies serve as exemplars of how individuals negotiate the racial formation processes of past and present. I suggest that there is reflexive and political potential in bio-based genealogy to transform our current racial ``common sense.'' The practice of genealogy reveals tacit social and biological assumptions that can serve as points of leverage for progressive social change, and yet vary by standpoint. In the context of the iconic gene we must be vigilant about the threat of genetic essentialism, yet the threat is mitigated by the simultaneous democratization of our knowledge and control over origin stories.	1	Karla B.

Identified processes were: (a) relying on God or God's word for support, guidance, and strength; (b) sanctifying the family by living religion at home; (c) resolving conflict with prayer, repentance, and forgiveness; (d) loving and serving others in the family, faith community, and wider community; (e) overcoming challenges and trials through shared faith; (f) abstaining from proscribed activities and substances; (g) sacrificing time, money, comfort, and convenience; (h) nurturing spiritual observance and growth through teaching, example, and discussion; (i) obeying God, prophets, parents, or commandments; and (j) putting faith or family ahead of personal or secular interests.	2	David C.

Chang, Paul & Dale Lim. 2009. 'Renegotiating the Sacred-secular Binary: Ix Saves and Contemporary Christian Music.' Review of Religious Research. 50:4 392-412.	Review of Religious Research	2009	1	The growth of the Contemporary Christian Music (CCM) industry has been phenomenal in the past few decades. CCM is a relatively fast growing ``genre'' in the music industry as a whole. Through an ethnographic account of one Contemporary Christian band, IX Saves, this study reveals the dynamics involved in the creative connection between faith-based messages and what were once thought of as secular musical genres. Contemporary Christian musicians' appropriation of musical genres found in the larger contemporary secular music scene is not without contestation and debate. The ethnographic data show the ways in which religious actors actively negotiate the nature of what constitutes secular versus sacred cultural products. In turn, the ability of religious actors to negotiate and redefine what is secular or sacred, highlights the looseness of the secular-sacred binary. This study has relevance for theoretical conceptualizations of the sacred-secular binary and offers one example of how religious groups engage, adapt, and subsequently survive in modern secular society.	2	Paul Y.

Rinaman, William, Matthew Loveland, Robert Kelly & William Barnett. 2009. 'Dimensions of Religiosity Among American Catholics: Measurement and Validation.' Review of Religious Research. 50:4 413-440.	Review of Religious Research	2009	2	To reflect the heterogeneity of the religiosity of American Catholics better we developed a multi-dimensional measurement system using national survey data (Contemporary Catholic Tends). Specifically, we employed cluster analysis to construct eight measures of key dimensions of American Catholic religiosity. We then tested convergent, discriminant, and construct validity hypotheses related to these measures and found that while the cluster measures were interrelated in expected ways, they also capture distinct features of American Catholic religiosity. Further, the cluster measures were useful in significantly and differentially improving the prediction of an important public policy attitudinal variable. The paper concludes that to better understand the role of religion in the lives of American Catholics, scholars should develop and validate more sophisticated measurement systems such as the type we describe.	4	William C.

Review of Religious Research	2009	0	This study analyzes the frequency, form, breadth, and depth of political cue-giving within the context of worship services. Based on reports from pastors themselves, it examines the kinds of cue-giving activities clergy approve within the confines of Sunday morning worship as well as what the types of cue-giving they actually report doing within such services. The study is based on data collected through random surveys of clergy, primarily from clergy within two denominations, collected following each of the past three presidential elections; one denomination is linked institutionally to the Evangelical Protestant tradition, the other linked institutionally to the mainline Protestant tradition. The data reveal that clergy engage in a variety of cue-giving activity, that most clergy report engaging in at least one form of such activity, that such endeavors tend to be relatively brief and that important changes may have occurred in such activities over time. Multivariate analysis reveals that religious and political factors tend to outweigh social and contextual factors in shaping the likelihood and extent of such cue-giving activity	2	Corwin Smidt; Brian Schaap

Review of Religious Research	2009	1	This study investigates a new understanding of clergy burnout based on the proposed psychological consequences of secularization. A new construct, internal orientation to ministry, was hypothesized to be associated with clergy burnout and distress. A sample of 262 Protestant ministers in Australia completed measures of burnout, anxiety, depression, religious self-esteem and religious problem-solving, as well as the Orientations to the Demands of Ministry Survey (ODM-S), which was developed to assess internal orientations towards ministry demands in a secularized society. Correlations with other religious measures supported the construct validity of the ODMS. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses showed that a weak internal ministry orientation was a significant predictor of burnout, depression and anxiety over and above the effects of key demographic and other religious measures. Together, the results of the study highlight the role of a weak internal orientation to ministry as a psychologically ``toxic'' response to the undermining social forces of secularization.	3	Maureen Miner; Sam Sterland; Martin Dowson

Rural Sociology	2009	11	The concept of the food desert, an area with limited access to retail food stores, has increasingly been used within social scientific and public health research to explore the dimensions of spatial inequality and community well-being. While research has demonstrated that. food deserts are frequently characterized by higher levels of poverty and food insecurity, there has been relatively little research examining the relationship between food deserts and obesity, particularly in rural areas. In this article we use Geographic Information System (GIS) techniques to identify food desert. areas in rural Pennsylvania. We then analyze student body mass index (BMI) data along with census and school district-level data to determine the extent to which the percentage of a school district's population residing within a food desert. is positively associated with increased incidence of child overweight among students within the district. We find that school districts with higher percentages of populations located within food deserts are more likely to be structurally and economically disadvantaged. Net of these district-level structural and economic characteristics, we additionally find;I positive relationship between increased rates of child overweight and the percentage of the district population residing in a food desert.	3	Kai A.

Rural Sociology. 74:2 178-200.	Rural Sociology	2009	3	Recent initiatives from state and federal government agencies have helped foster the formation of community-based watershed organizations. Although there is a great deal of enthusiasm about the potential of these organizations to enhance water quality, relatively little attention has been paid to the impacts, these organizations may have on the well-being of rural communities more generally. Assessments of effectiveness have typically focused on specific activities and accomplishments, rather than a broader range of community-based effects. In short, we ask whether community-based environmental management improves community as well as environment. Our research utilized it mixed-methods design, including a statewide mail survey of all Pennsylvania watershed organizations, followed by in-depth interviews with 28 rural watershed organizations. This sequential approach progressively explored in more detail definitions of effectiveness, including the building of rural capacity. We find watershed organizations are potentially effective mechanisms for building local leadership, enhancing the skills of rural residents, and making valuable connections with other communities, facing similar water-resource and rural-development issues. However, the range of issues with which local watershed organizations engage and the methods they currently utilize may eventually limit their usefulness.	5	Richard Stedman; Brian Lee; Kathryn Brasier; Jason L.

This ``area effects on health'' study examines rural-urban differences in childhood asthma hospitalizations within the state of Texas using negative binomial regression models. Effects associated with residence on the Texas-Mexico border, where the majority of rural Texas children live, are also considered. Neighborhood-level social class and proportion of the population that was native-born Hispanic were significant predictors of asthma hospitalizations, independent of rural-urban location. Conversely, proportion,,African American, Native American, and foreign-born Hispanic, not it citizen; median year of home Construction; and neighborhood location on the Texas-Mexico border were conditional on Urban-rural location, and the strength of these predictors was stronger in rural areas. This suggests that locational and social factors intersect in marginalized spaces (like the rural and border regions of Texas) to create vulnerability to asthma hospitalizations.	1	Sara E. Grineski

Voicu, Malina. 2009. 'Religion and Gender Across Europe.' Social Compass. 56:2 144-162.	Social Compass	2009	0	European societies have experienced a decrease in the social importance of religious issues. Values and attitudes towards gender roles have also changed in the last decades. In European countries, people have become more egalitarian with respect to the position of women in society. The author tries to identify the relationship between secularization and changes in gender values. As a result of secularization, the individual value system has become fragmented and religious values have lost their coordinating role. The investigation employs cross-national and longitudinal analysis of European Values Survey data (1990, 1999), most of the European countries being included in the study. The results indicate the decreasing impact of traditional religious belief on values related to gender roles during the 1990s in Europe and a common pattern of relationships between gender values and religiosity in most European societies.	1	Malina Voicu
Brechon, Pierre. 2009. 'the Measuring of Confessional Membership and Non-membership in Major European Surveys.' Social Compass. 56:2 163-178.	Social Compass	2009	1	The author aims to examine the main European surveys dealing with social and political issues-the European Values Survey (EVS), the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) and the European Social Survey (ESS)-to observe how religious affiliation and non-affiliation are measured. Are the questions similar in these surveys? Are the results for the same years identical with different indicators? The author gives information about the different available surveys but also highlights the effects of different wording. He looks into the reliability of answers ( is there bias linked to social ``desirability'', as some sociologists have shown for the USA?), and finally he emphasizes that this very simple data allows complicated issues to be dealt with ( singling out paradoxical categories like ``believing without belonging'' and ``belonging without believing''), and quite comprehensive profiles of typical attitudes of each denomination and of those without religion to be described.	1	Pierre Brechon
Reeh, Niels. 2009. 'Towards a New Approach to Secularization: Religion, Education and the State in Denmark, 1721-1900.' Social Compass. 56:2 179-188.	Social Compass	2009	1	The author attempts to develop a new approach to the process of secularization. It is argued that the existing theories of secularization have failed to pay sufficient attention to the state. Here, the state is regarded as an actor with interests among which the maintenance of sovereignty vis-a-vis other states is vital. The author has analysed Danish state policies with regard to the teaching of religion in elementary schools from 1700 onwards. The founding of schools in the early 18th century was crucial to the establishment of the ``Sacred Canopy'', since schools were almost exclusively devoted to the teaching of religion. These schools had a primarily military purpose. From the 18th century onwards the teaching of religion in Denmark changed according to the external relations of the state and state bodies, i.e. on the primary or vital interests of the state.	1	Niels Reeh
Perez-Agote, Alfonso. 2009. 'Three Waves of the Secularization of Consciences in Spain.' Social Compass. 56:2 189-201.	Social Compass	2009	2	The process of the secularization of consciences in Spain evolved in three stages. The first of these began in the 19th century and lasted until the Civil War (1936-1939). This stage was characterized by the growth of a series of movements that opposed the Catholic Church's presumptive monopoly on truth. The second wave corresponded to the spread of consumerism and lasted from the 1960s to the end of the 1980s. In this second stage, we see a loss of interest in the Catholic Church and religion. Spain, traditionally a Catholic country, steadily became a country of Catholic culture; this translated into a progressive decline in the ability of the Church to control social behaviour. A third wave began in the 1990s, since when the majority of the younger generation has been losing all contact with the Catholic Church and religion.	1	Alfonso Perez-Agote
Koussens, David. 2009. 'Neutrality of the State and Regulation of Religious Symbols in Schools in Quebec and France.' Social Compass. 56:2 202-213.	Social Compass	2009	1	The difference in attitudes towards the wearing of religious symbols in schools in France and Canada is symptomatic of the respective legal and political definitions of the official neutrality of the school institution and thus of way in which laicism is used to regulate religious pluralism and the ``socio-cultural'' integration of immigrant populations. In what ways is state neutrality put into practice, in Quebec and in France, as regards the judicial and political treatment of the wearing of religious symbols in public schools? The author proposes to examine the implementation of the liberal principle of neutrality by the French law dated 15 March 2004 on the wearing of religious symbols in public schools and by the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada of 2 March 2006 to allow a young Sikh to wear his ritual kirpan at school.	1	David Koussens
Monnot, Christophe. 2009. 'From Affliction to Preaching: When the Suffering Talk to the Community.' Social Compass. 56:2 214-225.	Social Compass	2009	0	How can charismatic believers speak about their suffering to religious peers when charismatic groups are influenced by the idea that the righteous are blessed with wellbeing and health? The author tries to understand this issue through the analysis of four testimonies given by sufferers during an evangelical worship service in Geneva, focusing on the interactions between these individuals and the group as they explained their trials in an otherwise normal worship context. From a stigmatised or discredited condition they arrived at an authoritative charismatic status, which allowed them to teach and explain the reasons for their suffering to the congregation. This status improvement was complete when the pastor, in his authoritative position, asked them to pray for the sick at the end of the service. For the first time, this study reveals the believers' performance behind the curtain of the common idea of ``healing centrality'' in Pentecostal theology.	1	Christophe Monnot
Giordan, Giuseppe. 2009. 'the Body Between Religion and Spirituality.' Social Compass. 56:2 226-236.	Social Compass	2009	4	The distinction between religion and spirituality, as it is increasingly understood in the contemporary sociology of religion, has led to a reconsideration of the relation between the individual and his/her own body. In the Christian ambit, and especially in the Catholic sphere, the traditional religious attitude has always been that of emphasizing the dichotomy between soul and body, setting a hierarchy that puts the soul in a position superior to the body's, according to an ascetic approach that, particularly in the Middle Ages, foresaw the ``mortification of the body''. In the contemporary spiritualist perspective, body and soul are seen as profoundly united, and the previous dichotomy seems to leave room for a more serene and less conflictual connection with one's body: spirituality relates to the sacred by leaving room for ( and deriving from) emotions, feelings, the physical and the sexual, and takes a holistic view of human nature. Such a shift from the religious dimension to the spiritual dimension in the relationship with one's body can be observed not only in popular culture but also within Catholicism itself.	1	Giuseppe Giordan
Wood, Matthew. 2009. 'the Nonformative Elements of Religious Life: Questioning the ``sociology of Spirituality'' Paradigm.' Social Compass. 56:2 237-248.	Social Compass	2009	3	Sociological assertions of religious vitality in Euro-American societies have developed a paradigm of spirituality in which, following earlier studies of the New Age, a distinction is drawn between external authority and self-authority. Methodologically and theoretically problematic, this paradigm diverts attention from people's social practices and interactions, especially in relation to multiple religious authorities. Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork with an English religious network, and building upon the work of Pierre Bourdieu, the author considers situations in which multiple authorities tend to relativize each other. Conceptualizing this in terms of ``nonformativeness'' - the lack of authorities' ability formatively to shape religious identity, habitus, and competition over religious capital - allows a new understanding of individual secularization to emerge that questions assertions of vitality.	1	Matthew Wood
Blasi, Anthony. 2009. 'a Market Theory of Religion.' Social Compass. 56:2 263-272.	Social Compass	2009	3	References to market phenomena are common enough in the sociology of religion, but despite the proliferation of systems of concatenate propositions that have been tested with survey and church membership data, little has been done to develop the conceptualization of how a religious market works. Consequently there is a significant lack of correspondence in the literature between the role market phenomena play in economics and the role of market-like counterparts in the religious field. While there may be some point to offering a correction to allegedly market-centered research in the sociology of religion, the intent here instead is to take what insights are to be had from the study of economic phenomena and draw out their implications for inquiry into religion.	1	Anthony J. Blasi
Martin, Eloisa. 2009. 'From Popular Religion to Practices of Sacralization: Approaches for a Conceptual Discussion.' Social Compass. 56:2 273-285.	Social Compass	2009	0	The concept of ``popular religion'' is among the most frequent to arise in debates on religion in social science. Nevertheless, there is often disagreement on the scope of this concept and its definition, which are the result of an implicit and indiscriminate notion of religion. The author identifies three main groups of works that describe and apply different definitions of popular religion. The first, clearly identified with a Catholic matrix, considers popular religion as the religion of the ``people''. The second focuses on the ``functions'' that popular religion fulfils among the poorest sectors of the population, as a way of dealing with deprivation. The third group suggests the existence of a ``different logic'' to analyse religious events. Basing herself on the main literature produced in Latin America on the subject, the author proposes a way round the problems raised by coining and discussing the concept of ``practices of sacralization''.	1	Eloisa Martin
Roof, Wade. 2009. 'American Presidential Rhetoric From Ronald Reagan to George W. Bush: Another Look at Civil Religion.' Social Compass. 56:2 286-301.	Social Compass	2009	2	The period since 1980 in the United States offers an opportunity to reexamine the ``American civil religion'' hypothesis as put forth by sociologist Robert N. Bellah. In a time of massive changes both domestically and globally, presidential rhetoric on God and country underwent important shifts in substance and style. The author examines several major myths by which Americans have affirmed their identity historically, and how these have informed the rhetoric of presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, William J. Clinton, and George W. Bush. It is argued that popular and highly contested ``public faiths'' in the United States blending religious and political ideals take diverse forms of expression and vary in the degree to which they approach a civil religion of the sort Bellah imagined. In this recent period, a shift toward religious nationalism is clearly evident.	1	Wade Clark Roof
Hughes, Melanie, Lindsey Peterson, Jill Harrison & Pamela Paxton. 2009. 'Power and Relation in the World Polity: the Ingo Network Country Score, 1978-1998.' Social Forces. 87:4 1711-1742.	Social Forces	2009	4	World polity theory is explicitly relational, implying a global network structure that exists outside of the nation-state. And world polity theory increasingly acknowledges power - that some states and regions are dominant in the international field. But current world polity measures of international nongovernmental organizations do not adequately incorporate either networks or power, leading to a mismatch between theory and measurement. In this article, we draw upon world polity, world system and social networks theories to inform the development Of a new over-time measure Of country-level connectedness to the world polity, which we label the ``INGO Network Country Score.'' This measure scores countries by their centrality in the world country-INGO network. We compare our newly-proposed INGO Network Country Score to the traditional measure (country-level raw counts of INGO memberships) and demonstrate striking differences. Our network-based measure shows less inequality among Western countries than the traditional measure, and greater inequality between the West and the rest of the world. Looking over time, we draw three further implications from our new measure. First, there is evidence of inequality in network centrality in the world polity at all time points. Second, regional inequalities persist. Third, connections in the world polity are not exponentially increasing, as previously hypothesized. An added benefit of the analysis is our presentation of the first visual representation of country connections through INGOs.	4	Melanie M. Hughes; Lindsey Peterson; Jill Ann Harrison; Pamela Paxton
Ruef, Martin & Kelly Patterson. 2009. 'Organizations and Local Development: Economic and Demographic Growth Among Southern Counties During Reconstruction.' Social Forces. 87:4 1743-1776.	Social Forces	2009	0	Under conditions of uncertainty, we predict that development will be tied to the idiosyncrasy of organizational forms represented within local regions. Our investigation applies this theory to data on 342 counties and 43,352 businesses in the US. South during Reconstruction, finding support for the thesis that organizational idiosyncrasy generally dampens growth and challenges taken-for-granted norms of community structure. The causal effect varies somewhat depending on whether the underlying mechanisms entail increases in the production of local goods, the accumulation of fixed capital, or the attraction Of new residents and retention of existing ones. We conclude by considering if the theory may generalize to other settings, including locales that depart markedly from the close-knit agrarian culture of the postbellum South.	2	Martin Ruef; Kelly Patterson
Hipp, John, George Tita & Robert Greenbaum. 2009. 'Drive-bys and Trade-ups: Examining the Directionality of the Crime and Residential Instability Relationship.' Social Forces. 87:4 1777-1812.	Social Forces	2009	18	Most prior research testing the hypothesis of the social disorganization theory that residential instability increases crime has used cross-sectional data. Using a unique dataset linking home sales address matched to census tracts with crime data in Los Angeles, we test the direction of this relationship using a six-year panel data design. We also test whether crime acts as a generator of transition and decline in neighborhoods by testing its effect on property values the following year. Our findings suggest little evidence that home sales volatility in one year leads to more property or violent crime the following year. Instead, higher levels of tract property and violent crime in one year lead to more home sales the following year. This effect of high crime rates is exacerbated in tracts with high levels of racial/ethnic heterogeneity, suggesting that such tracts may engender a distinct combination of fear and uncertainty in their residents, leading to more turn over. We also find that tracts with more violent crime one year have lower property values the following year, suggesting a general process of decline.	3	John R. Hipp; George E. Tita; Robert T. Greenbaum

Social Forces	2009	6	We investigate the social and behavioral characteristics Of male adolescents who self-identify as players, focusing particularly on Anderson claim that this social role is inextricably linked with poverty and minority status. Results indicate that black respondents, those affiliated with liberal peers and young men who initially report a relatively high number of sexual partners are more likely to resonate with this identity label. Nevertheless, analyses reveal that a number of players within the sample are not disadvantaged black youth, and there is considerable variability in their attitude and behavior profiles. Findings based on longitudinal analyses indicate that the player identity is a significant predictor of later variations in self-reported sexual behavior, net of traditional predictors, including prior behavior. Yet results of in-depth interviews conducted with a subset of the respondents complicate these quantitative findings, highlighting that young mend perceptions of this identity are not as uniformly positive as Anderson depiction might lead us to expect.	4	Peggy C.

Hopcroft, Rosemary. 2009. 'Gender Inequality in Interaction - an Evolutionary Account.' Social Forces. 87:4 1845-1871.	Social Forces	2009	1	In this article I argue that evolutionary theorizing can help sociologists and feminists better understand gender inequality. Evolutionary theory explains why control of the sexuality of young women is a priority across most human societies both past and present. Evolutionary psychology has extended our understanding of male violence against women. Here I add to these theories and present asexual selection argument to postulate possible evolved predispositions that promote young female deference to adult males in interaction and the converse, lack of male deference to young females. According to this argument, the pattern of greater female deference disappears when the women involved are past menopause. Put together, these ideas form an evolutionary account of gender inequality that complements and extends traditional sociological and feminist theories.	1	Rosemary L. Hopcroft
Mandel, Hadas & Michael Shalev. 2009. 'How Welfare States Shape the Gender Pay Gap: a Theoretical and Comparative Analysis.' Social Forces. 87:4 1873-1911.	Social Forces	2009	11	We assess the impact of the welfare state on cross-national variation in the gender wage gap. Earnings inequality between men and women is conceptualized as resulting from their different locations in the class hierarchy, combined with the severity of wage differentials between and within classes. This decomposition contributes to identifying the relevant dimensions Of we are states and testing their impact on women's relative earnings. Our empirical analysis is based on income and occupation-based indicators of class and utilizes microdata for 17 post-industrial societies. We find systematic differences between welfare regimes in the components of the gender gap. The evidence supports our claim that the state molds gender inequality in labor market attainments by influencing women class positions and regulating class inequality.	2	Hadas Mandel; Michael Shalev

Social Forces	2009	11	Whites, blacks and Latinos in the United States tend to live in different neighborhoods and attend different schools. Does this segregation influence youth in the long run? This study used longitudinal data from the NELS to see whether neighborhoods' or schools' proportion black and/or Latino during the high school years influences educational attainment through age 26. The analyses indicate that concentrations of blacks and Latinos in schools, but not zip code areas, associates with lower attainment in the long run. Students in predominantly black and Latino schools are less likely to earn a high school diploma or equivalent and to earn a bachelor's degree or more than similar students in predominantly white schools.	1	Pat Rubio Goldsmith
Jaeger, Mads. 2009. 'Equal Access but Unequal Outcomes: Cultural Capital and Educational Choice in a Meritocratic Society.' Social Forces. 87:4 1943-1971.	Social Forces	2009	16	This article argues that existing studies on cultural capital and educational success fail to distinguish the different channels through which cultural capital promotes educational success. Following Bourdieu, the article proposes that for cultural capital to promote educational success three conditions must hold: (1. parents must possess cultural capital, (2. they must transfer their cultural capital to children, and (3. children must absorb cultural capital and convert it into educational success. This research develops an empirical model that analyzes the significance of the three effects with respect to Danish children choice of secondary education. Denmark is well-suited for this study because access to secondary education is particularly meritocratic. The empirical analysis shows that all three channels through which cultural capital affects educational success are important.	1	Mads Meier Jaeger

Social Forces	2009	8	In this study we examine whether and why human and social resources increase charitable giving. Using the Giving in The Netherlands Panel Study 2003, we find that people with more extended networks and higher education are more generous. However, these effects can be completely explained by financial resources, church attendance, requests for donations, and prosocial personality characteristics. People with more extended social networks are mainly more generous because they receive more solicitations for donations, and are more integrated in extended religious networks that promote charitable giving. The generosity of people with higher formal education can be explained by their larger financial resources, and stronger verbal abilities. Whereas the effect of education seems mainly causal, that of network extension appears largely spurious.	2	Pamala Wiepking; Ineke Maas

Social Forces. 87:4 1997-2030.	Social Forces	2009	7	The relevance of family income for religious participation in the United States has been largely ignored in recent decades. Addressing this neglect, we focus our attention primarily upon white Catholics, the poorer of whom we reason have fewer options to participate in the context of an increasingly middle-class Church. Analyzing the 1972-2006 cumulative General Social Survey data, we show that net of all other factors low-income white Catholics attend church less often than other white Catholics, although social integration mechanisms significantly moderate the effects of income. Additional analyses suggest that the effects of income on church attendance are greatest for the younger white Catholic cohort. In contrast, the role of income in Latino Catholics' attendance is relatively weak. In our conclusion, we attempt to integrate our most puzzling finding - having children in the home does not increase the church attendance of low-income white Catholics - with our main theoretical line of argument concerning the central role of social integration in understanding the impact of income on religious participation.	3	Philip Schwadel; John D.

Falci, Christina & Clea McNeely. 2009. 'Too Many Friends: Social Integration, Network Cohesion and Adolescent Depressive Symptoms.' Social Forces. 87:4 2031-2061.	Social Forces	2009	17	Using a nationally representative sample of adolescents, we examine associations among social integration (network size), network cohesion (alter-density), perceptions of social relationships (e.g., social support) and adolescent depressive symptoms. We find that adolescents with either too large or too small a network have higher levels of depressive symptoms. Among girls, however, the ill effects of over-integration only occur at low levels of network cohesion. For boys, in contrast, the ill effects of over-integration only occur at high levels of network cohesion. Large social networks tend not to compromise positive perceptions of friend support or belonging; whereas, small networks are associated with low perceptions of friend support and belonging. Hence, perceptions of social relationships mediate the ill effects of under-integration, but not over-integration, on depressive symptoms.	2	Christina Falci; Clea McNeely

Social Forces	2009	8	Recent research suggests that racial residential segregation may be detrimental to health. This study investigates the influence of neighborhood racial isolation on obesity and considers the role Of neighborhood disorder as a mediator in this relationship. For the city of Philadelphia, we find that residence in a neighborhood with high black racial isolation is associated with a higher body mass index and higher odds of obesity among women, but not men, highlighting important sex differences in the influence of neighborhood structure on health. Furthermore, the influence of high racial isolation on women weight status is mediated, in part, by the physically disordered nature of such neighborhoods. Disorder of a more social nature (as measured by incident crime) is not associated with weight status.	3	Virginia W. Chang; Amy E. Hillier; Neil K. Mehta

It finds that changes in disparities in depressive symptoms, disability and self-assessments of health across the life course are cohort-related phenomena: (1. there is significant inter-cohort heterogeneity in health trajectories; (2. intra-cohort sex and race inequalities exist in levels of health but not in growth rates of all health problems; (3. there are inter-cohort variations in the intra-cohort heterogeneity - sex and race gaps change across cohorts in levels of health. Changes in the sex gap in growth rates of depression are also strongly contingent upon cohort membership.	2	Yang Yang; Linda C. Lee

Using data that include information about individuals' SES and health from childhood through late adulthood, I employ structural equation models that account for errors in measured variables and that allow for explicit tests Of various hypotheses about how SES and health are related. For each outcome and for both women and men the results provide no support for the health selection hypothesis. SES affects each health outcome at multiple points in the life course, but the reverse is not true.	1	John Robert Warren

Social Forces	2009	0	Pooling National Health Interview Survey 1972-1996 data, this study examines whether the threshold of health is rising, such that individuals are more likely to report poor health based on weaker symptoms. The results suggest that those with some form of disability report poor health more often today than they did in the past. Yet the results also reveal a pattern more complex than a simple rising-threshold story. For one, the results suggest a non-linear trend: the conditional reporting of poor health grew steadily until 1983, as expected, but declined thereafter. The results also point to mechanisms not regularly considered in the current debate. Much of the increase, such as it is, has been due to trends in educational attainment, rather than changes in the organization or practice of medicine. Meanwhile, the post-1983 deceleration and reversal has been due, in large part, to population aging. Implications are discussed with respect to the centrality of education in shaping the meaning of and demand for health, as well as the double-edged nature of contemporary medicalization.	1	Jason Schnittker

Common Patterns in the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States.' Social Politics. 16:2 210-241.	Social Politics	2009	12	We compare how gender inequality varies by educational level in the Netherlands, Sweden, and the United States, representing three different welfare regimes: the conservative, the social democratic, and the liberal. With few exceptions, gender inequality in labor force participation, work hours, occupational segregation, and housework are less severe as education goes up in all three countries, with the root cause being the high employment levels of well-educated women. Despite a common pattern across nations, we note that the educational gradient on gender equality in employment is weaker in Sweden. De-familialization policies in Sweden no doubt increase gender equality at the bottom by pulling less-educated women into the work force. One form of gender equality, wages, however, does not increase with education. In the United States, educational differences in the gender gap in wages are trivial; in Sweden and the Netherlands, the gender wage gap is greatest for the highly educated because of higher returns to education for men than women in these nations.	6	Marie Evertsson; Paula England; Irma Mooi-Reci; Joan Hermsen; Jeanne Bruijn; David Cotter

It offers both a ``half-full'' and a ``half-empty'' analysis and ends with the challenge posed to the Nordic model by growing ethnic diversity.	1	Ruth Lister

Social Politics	2009	1	In 1993, the Government of India reserved one-third of the seats in rural councils (panchayats) for women, and along with NGOs, set up programs to empower rural women. We examine the usefulness of a Foucauldian governmentality framework in analyzing how women participants in panchayati raj institutions in Pune District, India, have been produced and the ways in which they respond. We conclude that the emphasis of a strong Foucauldian perspective on structure at the expense of agency obscures the complexity of women's responses. In contrast, a weak Foucauldian perspective is able to recognize that in some cases these incorporation processes create assertive, reformist, and resourceful citizens.	1	Jana Everett
Degloma, Thomas. 2009. 'Expanding Trauma Through Space and Time: Mapping the Rhetorical Strategies of Trauma Carrier Groups.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 72:2 105-122.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	3	In this article, I detail two rhetorical strategies that trauma carrier groups-including social movement organizations, professional mental health associations, and patient advocacy groups-use to expand the relevance of trauma and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) through space and time: the social transmission of trauma and the social affiliation of traumatic experiences. With regard to social transmission, carrier groups claim that the psychological consequences of traumatic events are shared by members of established communities (a collective experience framework) and spread through social relationships (a social network framework). They expand the relevance of trauma and PTSD beyond those who directly experience the traumatic event at issue. With regard to social affiliation, carrier groups attribute common consequences to otherwise distinct events, making trauma and PTSD relevant to a growing variety of communities and individuals. Trauma carrier groups use both strategies to generalize a vocabulary of victimization and promote affective solidarity, providing discursive tools that a growing variety of individuals and communities can use to identify with trauma and its consequences. By mapping these rhetorical strategies, I propose a framework for analyzing the microsocial dynamics of cultural trauma and the expansion of the trauma concept as a diagnostic lens for defining diverse individual and social problems.	1	Thomas Degloma
Schwartz, Barry. 2009. 'Collective Forgetting and the Symbolic Power of Oneness: the Strange Apotheosis of Rosa Parks.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 72:2 123-142.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	9	Oneness refers to the convention of recognizing a single individual's performance and ignoring others, including those who may have performed as well. Although oneness is an adaptation to cognitive deficits, it cannot be explained by them. If long-term and working memory were more capacious, society need for ideals to establish realm-specific standards and meanings would tend to limit recognition and renown to one individual. The apotheosis of Rosa Parks is a case in point. Her celebrity and the obscurity of others who risked and accomplished more than she are two aspects of the same social process. Revealing oneness to be a social imperative, this case study leads to a broader understanding of collective forgetting.	1	Barry Schwartz
Kreager, Derek & Jeremy Staff. 2009. 'the Sexual Double Standard and Adolescent Peer Acceptance.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 72:2 143-164.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	23	The belief that women and men are held to different standards of sexual conduct is pervasive in contemporary American society. According to the sexual double standard, boys and men are rewarded and praised for heterosexual sexual contacts, whereas girls and women are derogated and stigmatized for similar behaviors. Although widely held by the general public, research findings on the sexual double standard remain equivocal, with qualitative studies and early attitudinal surveys generally finding evidence of the double standard and more recent experimental vignette designs often failing to find similar results. In this study, we extend prior research by directly measuring the social status of sexually permissive youth. We use data collected from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health to relate adolescents' self-reported numbers of sexual partners to a network measure of peer acceptance. Results suggest that the association between lifetime sexual partnerships and peer status varies significantly by gender, such that greater numbers of sexual partners are positively correlated with boys' peer acceptance, but negatively correlated with girls' peer acceptance. Moreover, the relationship between boys' sexual behaviors and peer acceptance is moderated by socioeconomic origins; sexually permissive boys from disadvantaged backgrounds are predicted to have more friendships than permissive boys from more advantaged backgrounds. Our results thus support the existence of an adolescent sexual double standard and suggest that sexual norms vary by both gender and socioeconomic origins.	2	Derek A. Kreager; Jeremy Staff
Rodriquez, Jason. 2009. 'Attributions of Agency and the Construction of Moral Order: Dementia, Death, and Dignity in Nursing-home Care.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 72:2 165-179.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	2	Using evidence gathered during 18 months of participant-observation in 2 nursing homes and 65 interviews with staff, this article examines how nursing-home staff use agency as a rhetorical resource to construct a dignified workplace. Staff attribute agency to dying residents, saying they choose the timing and conditions of their death. Staff equally insist that aggressive residents do not have agency. These two sets of attributions are used as counterpoints. Both go well beyond the available facts of the situation and reflect unspoken assumptions and interests of nursing-care workers. Through these attributions, the staff achieves a situated moral order in which compassionate care is provided to deserving residents in caring nursing homes. Staff attributions of agency are collectively shaped by professional philosophies, training and education, and regulatory guidelines. Finally, this article shows how it is analytically and theoretically productive to recast agency as a cultural object, whose use is subject to empirical investigation, rather than as a theoretical construct.	1	Jason Rodriquez
Schroeder, Tobias & Wolfgang Scholl. 2009. 'Affective Dynamics of Leadership: an Experimental Test of Affect Control Theory.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 72:2 180-197.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	9	Affect Control Theory (ACT; Heise 1979, 2007) states that people control social interactions by striving to maintain culturally shared feelings about the situation. The theory is based on mathematical models of language-based impression formation. In a laboratory experiment, we tested the predictive power of a new German-language ACT model with respect to actual behavior and felt emotions in leadership; 60 subjects managed a computer simulated company by communicating with 3 different virtual employees (within-subjects manipulation). Half of the subjects were primed with the concept of authoritarian leadership using a situational interview technique; the remainder was primed with the concept of democratic leadership (between-subjects manipulation). There were 14 dependent variables (leadership categories like praise, criticize, augment salary, etc). The German impression-formation model correctly predicted 27 of 42 between-subjects contrasts (P <. 05) and 56 of 84 within-subjects contrasts (p < .01). Moreover, Euclidean distances of emotions predicted by the German ACT model correlated negatively with the frequency with which the subjects experienced these emotions (correlations ranged from r = -.18 to r = -.61). These results support Affect Control Theory proposition that realistic social interaction can be predicted by mathematical models of affective consistency.	2	Tobias Schroeder; Wolfgang Scholl
Brunie, Aurelie. 2009. 'Meaningful Distinctions Within a Concept: Relational, Collective, and Generalized Social Capital.' Social Science Research. 38:2 251-265.	Social Science Research	2009	12	The proliferation of definitions and applications of social capital has prompted debate regarding the usefulness of the concept; there is thus an urgent need for a more rigorous usage of the term. This article proposes a distinction between three meaningful variants within the concept of social capital for the purpose of an improved dialogue and a sharpened application. The differences between these three variants-relational, collective, and generalized social capital-are first illuminated through a conceptual discussion. An empirical analysis testing the linkages between relational and collective social capital is then provided in the context of a household disaster preparedness study in Dominica. Together, analytical and empirical evidence supports the idea that social capital covers a variety of interrelated, yet distinct, social processes that operate simultaneously and may serve different purposes. On the basis of these results, this article calls for a theoretically and empirically meaningful treatment of social capital in terms of its three variants.	1	Aurelie Brunie
Kmec, Julie & Lindsey Trimble. 2009. 'Does It Pay to Have a Network Contact? Social Network Ties, Workplace Racial Context, and Pay Outcomes.' Social Science Research. 38:2 266-278.	Social Science Research	2009	4	This article investigates how social network use to find work affects pay. Analyses using the Multi-City Study of Urban Inequality consider the extent to which a network contact's influence level affects a job applicant's pay, whether this effect differs for white, black, and Latino contacts, and how workplace racial context moderates this relationship. Three main findings emerge. First, having an influential contact-one with hiring authority-compared to having no contact yields higher pay. Second, white and minority contact influence on pay differs: among minority contacts, being an outsider (i.e., someone not employed by the firm to which the applicant applies) is associated with higher pay, but being an employee of the firm-an insider-is not. Third, regardless of workplace racial context. black and Latino contacts' influence is most beneficial when their race/ethnicity is not known to the hiring agent. We offer a new interpretation of the mixed findings with regard to the relationship between social network use and pay.	2	Julie A. Kmec; Lindsey B. Trimble
Quillian, Lincoln & Rozlyn Redd. 2009. 'the Friendship Networks of Multiracial Adolescents.' Social Science Research. 38:2 279-295.	Social Science Research	2009	7	We investigate the friendship networks of multiracial adolescents through a comparison of the size and composition of the friendship networks of multiracial adolescents with single-race adolescents. We consider three hypotheses suggested by the literature on multiraciality and interracial friendships: (1) that multiracial adolescents have smaller friendship networks than single-race adolescents because they are more often rejected by their single-race peers, (2) that multiracial adolescents form more racially diverse friendship networks than single-race adolescents, and (3) that multiracial adolescents are especially likely to bridge (or socially connect) friendships among members of their single-race heritage background groups. Using data on adolescent friendship networks from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we find that multiracial adolescents are as popular as non-white adolescents and have social networks that are as racially diverse as the single-race groups with the most diverse friendship networks. Biracial adolescents with black ancestry have an especially high rate of friendship bridging between black persons and persons of other races, relative to black or white adolescents. The results hold using both self-identified and parental race definitions.	2	Lincoln Quillian; Rozlyn Redd

Social Science Research	2009	4	Despite dramatic changes in education and occupational opportunities for Blacks in the United States, facilitated by affirmative action policies, the White-Black earnings' gap has not vanished. Although the literature on this issue has become substantial no one has yet provided a systematic examination of changes in the earnings' gap that takes into consideration the concomitant changes in the occupational structure and changes in the racial composition of occupational labor markets as well as changes in characteristics of the labor force. In the present research, we use 5 waves of IPUMS data and hierarchical linear modeling to estimate changes in the effect of race on earnings between 1960 and 2000. The models focus on the interaction of time and race with earnings while controlling for individual-level characteristics (i.e. education) at the individual-level and the characteristics of detailed occupational labor markets (i.e. occupational socioeconomic status, race and gender composition, occupational earnings inequality) at the aggregate level. In order to evaluate the effect of change over time, both linear and non-linear trends in earning gaps are estimated in the labor market as a whole and separately for the public and private sectors. The data reveal that net of changes in the occupational distributions and market-relevant characteristics of Black and White men, the gaps have generally narrowed but at a declining rate. The data also reveal considerable differences in racial earnings inequality between the public and the private sectors. Whereas the unexplained earnings gap in the public sector has virtually vanished by 2000, in the private sector, the gap is still significant, although it declined over time. The findings are discussed in light of past research in order to re-evaluate the contribution of labor market attributes and sector differences to change in earnings disparities between Black and White men in the US.	2	Moshe Semyonov; Noah Lewin-Epstein
Martin, Lori. 2009. 'Black Asset Ownership: Does Ethnicity Matter?.' Social Science Research. 38:2 312-323.	Social Science Research	2009	1	Research has shown that blacks are relatively disadvantaged when compared with whites on a host of sociological indicators including on income, education and occupational status. Recent research has shown blacks are not all equally disadvantaged. In some cases such as in the case of blacks in Queens County, New York, blacks surpass whites in terms of median income, especially foreign-born blacks. Yet, blacks fare worse when compared with whites on indicators of asset ownership. Despite that, some black ethnic groups including those with roots in the Caribbean or from Africa have been shown to have higher rates of home ownership and higher housing values than African-Americans. However, few studies include measures of asset ownership beyond these indicators when assessing the extent to which ethnicity matters for blacks. The present study examines the following research questions: (1) What factors explain variations in the likelihood of ownership and the levels of interest, dividends and rental income owned for blacks? (2) Is ethnicity a significant predictor for black respondents? (3) Does education and occupation matter more for some black ethnic groups than for others? The findings reveal that ethnicity plays a significant role in the acquisition and accumulation of interest, dividends and rental income, but it does not account for all of the variations observed for blacks. The findings shed further light on the complexities associated with understanding wealth inequality and racial and ethnic group variations.	1	Lori Latrice Martin
Riosmena, Fernando. 2009. 'Socioeconomic Context and the Association Between Marriage and Mexico-us Migration.' Social Science Research. 38:2 324-337.	Social Science Research	2009	7	In this paper, I analyze how the association between Mexico-U.S. migration and marriage varies across socioeconomic settings in origins. Using Mexican Migration Project data and employing bilevel survival analysis with controls for socioeconomic, migrant network, and marriage market characteristics and family size, I find that single people are most likely to migrate relative to those married in areas of recent industrialization, where the Mexican patriarchal system is weaker and economic opportunities for both men and women make post-marital migration less attractive. Marital status is not significant in agriculture-dependent areas, where the bargaining power of husbands might be higher relative to other settings; their age-profiles of earnings flatter: and remunerated female work scarcer, making migration attractive later in the life course.	1	Fernando Riosmena
Adamczyk, Amy & Cassady Pitt. 2009. 'Shaping Attitudes About Homosexuality: the Role of Religion and Cultural Context.' Social Science Research. 38:2 338-351.	Social Science Research	2009	25	Across the globe, the debate over homosexuality continues, with great variation in public opinion about the acceptability of homosexuality, laws regulating same-sex unions and penalties for homosexual sex behaviors. Religion is often seen as an important predictor of attitudes about homosexuality. However, cross-national differences in cultural orientations suggest that the role religion has in explaining homosexual attitudes may depend on a nation's cultural context. In this study, we merge ideas from cultural sociology and religious contextual effects to explain cross-national variation in public opinion about homosexuality. Using data from the fourth wave of the World Values Survey and Hierarchical Modeling techniques, we find support for the micro and macro effects of religion and a survival vs. self-expressive cultural orientation. Moreover, we find that personal religious beliefs have a greater effect on attitudes about homosexuality in countries like the United States, which have a strong self-expressive cultural orientation.

Social Science Research	2009	39	Anti-immigration attitudes and its origins have been investigated quite extensively. Research that focuses on the evolution of attitudes toward immigration, however, is far more scarce. In this paper, we use data from the first three rounds of the European Social Survey (ESS) to study the trend of anti-immigration attitudes between 2002 and 2007 in 17 European countries. In the first part of the paper, we discuss the critical legitimacy for comparing latent variable means over countries and time. A Multiple-Group Multiple Indicator Structural Equation Modeling (MGSEM) approach is used to test the cross-country and cross-time equivalence of the variables under study. In a second step, we try to offer an explanation for the observed trends using a dynamic version of group conflict theory. The country-specific evolutions in attitudes toward immigration are shown to coincide with national context factors, such as immigration flows and changes in unemployment rates.	3	Bart Meuleman; Eldad Davidov; Jaak Billiet
Kroska, Amy & Cheryl Elman. 2009. 'Change in Attitudes About Employed Mothers: Exposure, Interests, and Gender Ideology Discrepancies.' Social Science Research. 38:2 366-382.	Social Science Research	2009	9	Using a sample of continuously-married individuals (793 women and 847 men) and their spouses drawn from the first two waves of the NSFH, we examine change in individuals' attitudes about mothers' employment. We investigate hypotheses derived from three models of attitude change: the exposure model, the interest-based model, and the control model. We find support for hypotheses derived from ail three. Consistent with exposure hypotheses, the adoption of fundamentalist beliefs reduces egalitarianism, while spouses' egalitarianism and spouses' education are positively related to individuals' own egalitarianism. As predicted in both exposure and interest hypotheses, women's entry into employment is positively related to women's egalitarianism, while wives' occupational prestige is positively related to men's egalitarianism. Congruent with the interest model, the presence of a young child is positively associated with women's egalitarianism. Consistent with the exposure model, the number of children in the home reduces men's egalitarianism, and a traditional division of housework decreases women's egalitarianism. Finally, consistent with the gender ideology discrepancy hypothesis, derived from the control model, individuals whose background, work, and family life are inconsistent with their gender ideology at wave 1 shift their gender ideology at wave 2 in a direction that is more compatible with their background, work, and family life: egalitarians with traditional life patterns at wave I are more traditional in their gender ideology at wave 2, and traditionals with egalitarian life patterns at wave I are more egalitarian at wave 2. We discuss the implications of these patterns for larger scale change in gender ideology.	2	Amy Kroska; Cheryl Elman

Social Science Research	2009	4	Using data on young English learners (EL) who enroll in the New York City public school system, I examine how long it takes students to become minimally proficient in English and how the time to proficiency differs for students by their age of school entry. Specifically, I follow four recent entry cohorts of ELs ages 5-10 and use discrete-time survival analysis to model the rate at which different age groups acquire proficiency. I find that approximately half of the students become proficient within three years after school entry and that younger students learn more quickly than older students. Age of entry differences are robust to controls for observed differences between age of entry groups in their economic and demographic characteristics, their disabilities, and the schools they attend. The results lend support to the theory that older students face developmental barriers to learning new languages quickly.	1	Dylan Conger

Social Science Research. 38:2 397-411.	Social Science Research	2009	3	In this paper we introduce a new way to conceptualize and measure the educational resources that young people encounter as they make their way from kindergarten to high school graduation. Using recent methodological advances in group-based modeling and a unique data set, we empirically test for and identify a series of categorically distinct school characteristic trajectories. We find that these trajectories vary significantly in terms of their intercept and slope, their prevalence within the sampled population, and in the sociodemographic makeup of their constituent members. We then present an extended empirical example illustrating relationships between school characteristic trajectories and important post-secondary educational outcomes, both before and after controlling for static, single-year measures of primary and secondary school characteristics. Our results suggest that the chronology of students' exposures to different educational resources is significantly associated with college enrollment, college selectivity, and, in some instances, college completion.	3	Andrew Halpern-Manners; John Robert Warren; Jennie E.

Yeung, Wei-Jun & Kathryn Pfeiffer. 2009. 'the Black-white Test Score Gap and Early Home Environment.' Social Science Research. 38:2 412-437.	Social Science Research	2009	5	Based on panel data for three age cohorts of children from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we examine how early home environment contributes to black-white achievement gaps at different developmental stages and the extent to which early gaps contribute to later racial achievement gaps. We find large black-white test score differences among children of all ages even before children start formal schooling. Except for the oldest cohort, the gaps for all tests widened when children's cognitive skills were assessed six years later. Racial achievement gaps in applied problem scores by grade three and letter-word scores by grade six, can be accounted for by child's characteristics, family socioeconomic background, and mother's cognitive skills. However, these covariates explain an increasingly smaller proportion of the black-white achievement gap as children advance to higher grades. Gaps in early cognitive skills are highly predictive of gaps at later ages, setting off a trajectory of cumulative disadvantage for black children over time. Our results underscore the key role of early home environment and the intergenerational roots of the persistent black-white achievement gap.	2	Wei-Jun Jean Yeung; Kathryn M. Pfeiffer
Youngreen, Reef, Bridget Conlon, Dawn Robinson & Michael Lovaglia. 2009. 'Identity Maintenance and Cognitive Test Performance.' Social Science Research. 38:2 438-446.	Social Science Research	2009	0	Identity maintenance processes can affect performance when that performance is relevant to an important self-identity, including performance on standardized tests of mental ability. Affect control theory proposes that individuals' performances are motivated to maintain concordance between fundamental sentiments about identities and contextually driven transient meanings. An experimental test used the college major identity and randomly assigned participants to different instruction sets that made an aptitude test either relevant to their major or a contrasting major (All participants took the Raven advanced progressive matrices test.). Participants who took a test of mental ability that they expected would verify their identity scored two and a half points higher than did participants who took a test of mental ability expected to verify a contrasting identity. Results strongly support the fundamental validity of affect control theory's predictions about situational meaning maintenance [Heise, David R., 1979.

Foschi, Martha. 2009. 'Gender, Performance Level, and Competence Standards in Task Groups.' Social Science Research. 38:2 447-457.	Social Science Research	2009	3	Male and female undergraduates (N = 240) participated in opposite-sex dyads and worked on a computerized visual task presented as ``masculine.'' Participants in the eight experimental conditions received either higher or lower scores than their partner; this phase was omitted in the two control conditions. In turn, half of the experimental groups received universal competence-standards from the experimenter, while the other half set standards by themselves. In the second phase, the two persons worked on the task as a team. The central hypothesis is that subject-generated standards will favor the men, and that this will result in the women being perceived as having less competence even if achieving the same performance-level as men: this inequality is predicted to no longer be maintained in the groups with experimenter-set standards. Measures include rejection of influence, perceived ability in self and partner, and level of acceptance of both the stated sex-linkage of the task and the experimenter-set standard. Results and their interpretation are presented and discussed in detail.	1	Martha Foschi
Timberlake, Jeffrey. 2009. 'Effects of Household and Neighborhood Characteristics on Children's Exposure to Neighborhood Poverty and Affluence.' Social Science Research. 38:2 458-476.	Social Science Research	2009	2	I construct covariate-adjusted increment-decrement life tables to estimate racial differences in the duration of children's exposure to neighborhood poverty and affluence. Using geocoded data from the 1999 and 2001 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I estimate that black children born in 1999 can expect to spend about 9 of their first 18 years in poor neighborhoods, compared to less than 2 years for white children. Bivariate inequality in childhood exposure is reduced by 16\% after controlling for racial differences in household characteristics, by 39\% after controlling for differences in the racial composition and spatial location of children's neighborhoods, and by 46\% after controlling for both sets of factors. These findings indicate that household and especially urban ecological factors strongly affect the amount of time that black and white children can expect to spend in poor and nonpoor neighborhoods throughout childhood. I conclude by discussing some policy implications of the findings.	1	Jeffrey M. Timberlake
Cheadle, Jacob. 2009. 'Parent Educational Investment and Children's General Knowledge Development.' Social Science Research. 38:2 477-491.	Social Science Research	2009	8	Drawing on longitudinal data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-1999, this study used IRT modeling to operationalize a parental educational investment measure based upon Lareau's notion of `concerted cultivation.' The analysis used multilevel piecewise growth models regressing children's general knowledge achievement from kindergarten through the first grade on a measure of concerted cultivation and indicators of the family context. The measure of concerted cultivation explained over 30\% of the SES gradient and an additional 20-25\% of the race/ethnic general know[edge gaps at kindergarten entry after controlling for SES, and was larger than the SES coefficient in magnitude. These findings (a) lend partial support to Lareau's contention that concerted cultivation explains SES learning advantages; (b) contradict the argument that net of SES, concerted cultivation is mostly unrelated to race/ethnic gaps: (c) and raises questions about the importance concerted cultivation for learning disparities after school entry.	1	Jacob E.

Overall, John, Scott Tonidandel & Robert Starbuck. 2009. 'Last-observation-carried-forward (locf) and Tests for Difference in Mean Rates of Change in Controlled Repeated Measurements Designs With Dropouts.' Social Science Research. 38:2 492-503.	Social Science Research	2009	1	Last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) originated as a way of replacing missing measurements for use in classical repeated measurements analysis of variance (ANOVA) where complete data are required. As mathematical statisticians developed newer methods in the attempt to deal effectively with missing data, LOCF fell largely by the wayside. This paper reports use of simulation methods to evaluate validity of tests of significance for differences in mean rates of change applied to LOCF-completed data and compares results with those from alternative procedures that do not require replacement of the missing values for dropouts. Across several different data structures and dropout mechanisms, tests of significance for difference in means of slope coefficients fitted to LOCF data maintained appropriate Type 1 error protection. In no case where the Type 1 error rates of more complex generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) tests appeared appropriately conservative did the power of those tests exceed power of the simpler test on LOCF-completed data.	3	John E.

'the Undeserving Rich: ``moral Values'' and the White Working Class.' Sociological Forum. 24:2 225-253.	Sociological Forum	2009	10	White working-class citizens who vote for the Republican Party have been fodder for much political discussion and speculation recently, and a debate has arisen about the role that ``moral values'' played in the political decision making of this segment of voters. In this article, we defend a version of the moral values claim. We show that although the Republicans' policies are unpopular, they are bundled with an overarching moral framework that is extremely resonant to this set of voters, and we use in-depth interviews to uncover this framework. A key feature of this framework, on which in the 2004 presidential election George W. Bush scored high and John Kerry scored low, is the appropriate attitude to wealth, which serves as an indicator for a candidate's general moral philosophy and as a heuristic about whether the candidate will govern with working-class voters' interests in mind. National Election Studies data support the argument that this was a key influence on the voting decision in 2004, even controlling for voters' partisan identification.	8	Monica Prasad; Andrew J.

Sociological Forum	2009	6	This study examines how bilingualism affects the wages of Asian and Hispanic workers using 2000 Census data. In contradiction to the general belief that bilingualism can provide a competitive advantage in the labor market, we find no evidence that 1.5-generation and U.S.-born Asian and Hispanic bilingual workers generally have higher wages than their English monolingual co-ethnics; in some cases, in fact, their wages are significantly lower. In search of specific circumstances under which bilingualism might provide an economic advantage, we also examine interactions of language with such variables as education, employment in the public rather than the private sector, and the size of the population of mother-tongue speakers. With limited exceptions, we find no sign of greater economic returns to bilingualism. Since bilingualism requires considerable effort to maintain across generations in the United States, we conclude that the virtual absence of economic rewards for it creates pressure for linguistic assimilation.	2	Hyoung-jin Shin; Richard Alba
Tepper, Steven. 2009. 'Stop the Beat: Quiet Regulation and Cultural Conflict.' Sociological Forum. 24:2 276-306.	Sociological Forum	2009	5	This article explores a recent conflict over the youth phenomenon known as ``raving'' in the City of Chicago. By interviewing participants involved in the conflict, I set out to understand the extent to which the crackdown on raves in Chicago was similar to earlier social reactions to jazz, comic books, rock and roll, and Dead Head culture, as well as to more recent conflicts over punk, rap music, and raves in other cities. While most previous research on cultural conflict has focused on moral crusades, campaigns, and panics, the Chicago conflict represents an example of ``quiet regulation.'' Opponents refrained from highly visible, morally charged attacks; instead, in the absence of media hype and visible public discourse, public officials justified the crackdown in highly bureaucratic terms-avoiding risk, collecting taxes, enforcing codes. Nonetheless, they also drew on cultural schemas that linked raves and raving with drugs, sex, and deviance. As a result, officials selected a course of regulation that criminalized DJs and discredited the artform. In the absence of a highly visible moral campaign, the rave participants were unable to mobilize and resist the regulation and defend their lifestyle. Sociologists must move beyond highly visible campaigns and crusades and pay greater attention to quiet regulation, both because such regulation is likely to increase in the future and because it has significant consequences for power, cultural expression, and identity.	1	Steven J.

Anderson, Tammy. 2009. 'Understanding the Alteration and Decline of a Music Scene: Observations From Rave Culture.' Sociological Forum. 24:2 307-336.	Sociological Forum	2009	4	The sociological study of scenes-music and otherwise-has flourished in the latter twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. Most research has documented a scene's origins or its ``evolution'' into mainstream culture. Fewer studies have systematically addressed what leads to a scene's alteration and decline, although many scholars have partially addressed it in authenticity studies anchored in the Frankfurt School's claims about culture and economics. Are culture industries sufficient in explaining music scene transformation? The present article attempts to explain the cultural transformation of the Philadelphia rave scene and to articulate its relevance for other kinds of social worlds. Using a multimethod ethnographic approach, I show that five forces (generational schism, commercialization, cultural otherness/deviance and self destruction, social control, and genre-based scene fragmentation) help explain the alteration and decline of the rave scene from its high point in the mid to late 1990s to its diminished and fragmented state presently. In describing these forces, I hope to move beyond culture industry narratives toward a broader explanation of cultural change, one that is lacking not only in music scene studies, but also in literatures on many other kinds of social worlds.	1	Tammy L.

Beck, Colin. 2009. 'State Building as a Source of Islamic Political Organization.' Sociological Forum. 24:2 337-356.	Sociological Forum	2009	1	Previous research on political Islam in the Middle East and North Africa has been limited in providing a generalizable theory of its origins and systematically account for the cross-national variation in the prevalence of Islamic movements. Following a state-centered approach, this study argues that state-building activities are a primary origin of Islamic movements. Regimes adopt religious symbolism and functions that legitimate the role of Islam in the public sphere. State incorporation of religion thus creates Islam as a frame for political action, with increased access to mobilizing resources and better able to withstand repression and political exclusion. To provide an explicit and systematic test of cross-national variation, data on 170 political and militant organizations across the region are analyzed. Results indicate that state incorporation of religion is a crucial factor in the religiosity of movement organizations. Mixed effects of political exclusion and repression are found. No support is found for theories of economic grievances or foreign influence as causes of Islamic mobilization. In sum, analysis suggests that a state-centered perspective is the most fitting account of political Islam.	1	Colin J. Beck
Roxburgh, Susan. 2009. 'Untangling Inequalities: Gender, Race, and Socioeconomic Differences in Depression.' Sociological Forum. 24:2 357-381.	Sociological Forum	2009	13	In their important paper, Link and Phelan (1995) argue that socioeconomic status is a fundamental cause of variation in well-being and that the social resources associated with socioeconomic status constitute the fundamental cause of variation in well-being. In this article, I elaborate on the fundamental cause perspective in three respects: by suggesting an expansion of the definition of resources, by examining how race and gender influence variation in the relationship between resources and mental health, and by developing a model of the relationship between social class, race, and gender that takes account of the potential asymmetry in the influence of resources across race and gender. Using the 2003 National Health Interview Survey and ordinary least squares regression, I find that black and white men are significantly less depressed than black and white women. However, women accrue greater mental health advantage from marriage, home ownership, and education. African-American men experience less depression as a result of being unmarried and non-Hispanic white women experience less benefit from full-time employment, relative to African-American women and men. Results are discussed in terms of implications for future research on race, class, and gender differences in health.	1	Susan Roxburgh
Wilson, George. 2009. 'Downward Mobility of Women From White-collar Employment: Determinants and Timing by Race.' Sociological Forum. 24:2 382-401.	Sociological Forum	2009	2	This study uses data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics to assess the minority vulnerability thesis, which maintains there are racial differences among women in the determinants of, and timing to, downward mobility from white-collar employment. In accord with the theory, a racialized continuum emerges along both issues. The route to downward mobility for African Americans is relatively broad based and unstructured by traditional stratification-based causal factors, that is, human capital, background socioeconomic status, and job/labor-market characteristics, and they are quickest to experience downward movement. The route to downward mobility for whites is relatively narrow and structured by stratification-based causal actors, and they are the slowest to experience downward movement. Along both issues, Latinas occupy an intermediate position between African Americans and whites. Implications of the findings for understanding of racial inequality in white-collar employment are discussed.	1	George Wilson

Sociological Forum	2009	7	Using ethnographic data, this study investigates network building and the transition from school to work in a career center at a nonprestigious university. Now that disadvantaged students have increased their participation in higher education, it is important to investigate the role of the university in these students' transition from school to work. I found competing forces of stratification at work in the college career center and while the center mitigated inequality for some, it reproduced inequality for others. The Career Center staff faced pressures to recruit corporations to build job networks, but disinterest from the hiring organizations. Through their interactions with recruiters, the staff saw that African Americans and Latinos were not the standard for the labor market. Although network building ruled the overarching organizational goals, intersections of race, gender, and nationality became the defining logic of the hiring process.

Sociological Forum	2009	3	In recent issues, Sociological Forum has had much to say on issues such as politics and voting (see, e.g., Burstein and Hirsh, 2007;Fullerton and Borsch, 2008; Peoples, 2008; Prasad et al., 2009;Ruane and Cerulo, 2008). The journal has featured several ethnographic accounts as well (see, e.g., Anderson, 2009; Auyero and Swistun, 2009; Gamson, 2007). In this essay, I combine theme and method, yielding a personal account of my experiences as a volunteer for the Obama campaign.	1	Magali Sarfatti Larson

Feliciano, Cynthia. 2009. 'Education and Ethnic Identity Formation Among Children of Latin American and Caribbean Immigrants.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:2 135-158.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	10	While some scholars argue that ethnic identities influence educational achievement, few studies have examined whether education influences ethnic identity formation. This study uses a longitudinal survey to examine changes in ethnic identities from adolescence to adulthood among children of Latin American and Caribbean immigrants and how educational attainments, and other life experiences, relate to those changes. Contrary to assimilation frameworks suggesting that incorporation into mainstream higher education institutions should lead to greater identification as American or with U.S.-created racial/panethnic categories, such as Latino or black, these findings show that the most educated adult respondents identified with both their countries of origin and the United States, regardless of how they identified as adolescents. This study suggests that educational institutions are important contexts in which racial and ethnic identities are formed.	1	Cynthia Feliciano
Kalogrides, Demetra. 2009. 'Generational Status and Academic Achievement Among Latino High School Students: Evaluating the Segmented Assimilation Theory.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:2 159-183.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	2	In this study, the author evaluates some of the key assertions of the segmented assimilation theory by examining the generational pattern of achievement among Latino high school students. Segmented assimilation theory posits that the outcomes of immigrants will not necessarily improve monotonically across generations, especially in disadvantaged contexts, and that maintaining familial and ethnic ties can have a protective effect on immigrant students. The author tests these ideas by examining variation in the generational pattern of achievement in low-income schools among Latino high school students. The author finds that changes in achievement across generations generally follow a pattern of classical assimilation with small, though not statistically significant, improvements in achievement from the first to the second generation and from the second to the third generation in both poor and nonpoor schools. Contrary to hypotheses derived from segmented assimilation theory, the author finds no evidence of ``downward assimilation'' across generations among Latinos attending low-income schools.	1	Demetra Kalogrides
Martin, Nathan. 2009. 'Social Capital, Academic Achievement, and Postgraduation Plans at an Elite, Private University.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:2 185-210.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	1	Many studies have explored how social capital influences the academic experiences of secondary school students. A distinct literature has demonstrated the beneficial effects of social contacts on occupational attainment and the job search process. However, few studies have explored the effects of social capital at the postsecondary level. This study bridges this gap in the literature by examining the effects of campus social networks on college academic achievement and postgraduation education and occupation plans, using detailed panel data from an elite, private university. Results indicate that campus social networks have little effect on early college outcomes, although students with extensive networks are more likely to graduate with honors and continue on to graduate school. Students with extensive campus networks and extracurricular memberships are more likely to aspire to high-status professional occupations, especially as medical doctors, while family or personal networks are more important for aspiring lawyers.	1	Nathan D.

Ma, Yingyi. 2009. 'Family Socioeconomic Status, Parental Involvement, and College Major Choices-gender, Race/ethnic, and Nativity Patterns.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:2 211-234.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	8	College major choice is a much-neglected yet highly significant topic in sociological research. This article focuses on family socioeconomic status (SES) and parental involvement to examine potential family influences on patterned college major choice by gender, race/ethnicity, and nativity. Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study 1988-1994 (NELS: 88-94), this study confirms old gender patterns and finds new racial/ethnic patterns in college major choice. Lower SES children are found to favor more lucrative college majors. Family SES is found to have differential effects on men and women and for racial/ethnic minorities and whites. Parental involvement in children's domain-specific education exerts significant effects on children's college major choice. These together suggest important theoretical and policy implications.	1	Yingyi Ma
Rippeyoung, Phyllis. 2009. 'Is It Too Late Baby? Pinpointing the Emergence of a Black-white Test Score Gap in Infancy.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:2 235-258.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	2	This research attempts to uncover when the black-white test score gap begins and why it exists by examining a nationally representative sample of infants using the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Birth Cohort. The findings demonstrate that there is a small raw gap in cognitive skills between the infants of white and black mothers in the United States. However, through structural equation modeling, results show that when one controls for social, human, and financial capital and for differences in health and type of child care, the infants of African American mothers would score higher than the infants of white mothers because of their precocious motor development. Social capital and low birth weight are found to be key mediators of the small black-white test score gap in infancy.	1	Phyllis L. Rippeyoung
Cooky, Cheryl. 2009. '``girls Just Aren't Interested'': the Social Construction of Interest in Girls' Sport.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:2 259-283.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	1	Given the significant increase in the number of women and girls participating in sport, it is now a commonly held belief that girls have ample opportunities to participate in sport and, consequently, that girls who do not participate choose to do so because they simply lack interest in sport. Using qualitative methodologies and the sociology of accounts, the author examines a recreational sport program for low-income minority girls in the metropolitan Los Angeles area. Applying Giddens's theory of structuration to emergent themes from participant observations and interviews, the findings illustrate how structures, as they are embodied through the everyday interactions of their participants, simultaneously constrain certain forms of agency while enabling other forms. This study advances sociology's disciplinary understanding of social construction by illustrating how social structure and cultural discourses interact in shaping everyday social interactions.	1	Cheryl Cooky
Berns, Nancy. 2009. 'Contesting the Victim Card: Closure Discourse and Emotion in Death Penalty Rhetoric.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:3 383-406.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	2	Closure for crime victims' families has become an important cultural narrative in the past two decades. This paper furthers our understanding of motivational framing and emotional resonance by illustrating how death penalty advocates use emotion-domain expansion to tap into the popular concept of ``closure.'' By arguing that the death penalty can bring closure and healing to crime victims' families, advocates expand their emotional appeal. Abolitionists have also embraced closure and argue that other options are preferable for victims' families. Implications of this process include shifts in death penalty rhetoric, new feeling rules, emotive dissonance, and the institutionalization of closure.	1	Nancy Berns
Einwohner, Rachel. 2009. 'the Need to Know: Cultured Ignorance and Jewish Resistance in the Ghettos of Warsaw, Vilna, and Lodz.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:3 407-430.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	5	This article explores the role of knowledge in collective action with an examination of resistance efforts in the Jewish ghettos of Nazi-occupied Warsaw, Vilna, and Lodz during World War II. Because sustained collective resistance took place in Warsaw but not in the other two ghettos, a comparison of these cases is useful toward an understanding of the factors that facilitate collective action. Drawing on Schwartz's concept of ``structured ignorance'' and Snow and Benford's discussion of ``empirical credibility,'' I show that resistance occurred when and where Jews were able to gain information about the Nazi regime's genocidal plans and believed that information to be credible. The cases therefore suggest that in addition to being ``structured,'' ignorance may also be ``cultured,'' in the sense that there may be limits to what individuals will interpret as possible and true. Warsaw Jews fought back in part because they were able to overcome both structured and cultured ignorance, while Jews in the other ghettos were not able to overcome these barriers to collective action. Suggestions for further research are outlined.	1	Rachel L. Einwohner
Best, Joel & Kathleen Lowney. 2009. 'the Disadvantage of a Good Reputation: Disney as a Target for Social Problems Claims.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:3 431-449.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	2	Social scientists generally presume that a good reputation has advantages. Yet the Walt Disney Corporation, a firm that has long benefited from a reputation for producing wholesome popular culture, attracts more than its share of efforts to link it to various social problems. In particular, conservative moralists argue that Disney in fact produces morally questionable products, progressive critics claim that Disney's messages help preserve social inequities, and social scientists criticize Disney for fostering inauthentic and alienating entertainment. These claims are a form of blowback-negative reactions to the firm's positive reputation. While blowback makes it easier to construct social problems claims, a good reputation remains a significant resource in deflecting these criticisms.	2	Joel Best; Kathleen S. Lowney

Sociological Quarterly	2009	3	This article on low-income ``one-parent mothers'' in Israel is based on 32 in-depth interviews and supportive data from a longitudinal study. Findings problematize scholarly treatments of ``single mothers'' as a universal category, showing it to be culturally specific and polysemic. It is argued that low-income one-parent mothers embody a central tension in the Israeli male-breadwinner/female-caretaker gender contract, as its initial class bias is exacerbated by the dissolution of marriage. By simultaneously adopting and reformulating the hegemonic schema that frames their femininity as deficient, they expose the dual character of the contract as resistant to change and dynamic.	1	Amalia Sa'ar

Sociological Quarterly	2009	1	Research on the size-job rewards relationship emphasizes extrinsic rewards that are typically more prevalent in large, complex organizations. We examine whether certain intrinsic rewards are more characteristic of small firms and shift the focus from manufacturing industries to professional service (law) firms. We find that small is not entirely beautiful. Smaller firms offer more autonomy but no more challenging work or better coworker relations, whereas larger firms offer lucrative salaries, enhanced benefits, and greater promotional opportunities. Our results challenge the compensating differential explanation whereby large firms offer superior extrinsic rewards to compensate for a shortfall of instrinsic job rewards.	2	Jean E.

Loseke, Donileen. 2009. 'Examining Emotion as Discourse: Emotion Codes and Presidential Speeches Justifying War.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:3 497-524.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	7	Observers commonly argue that emotional appeal is critical for persuasive communication in mass media, science and social policy hearings, social problem advocacy, and politics. This raises a practical question: How can appeals to emotion be accomplished in mass audiences characterized by heterogeneity? I explore this question by theorizing emotional persuasion to be encouraged by the artful use of ``emotion codes,'' which are sets of socially circulating ideas about which emotions are appropriate to feel when, where, and toward whom or what, as well as how emotions should be outwardly expressed. As an illustration, I examine an instance of presidential communication surrounding war, the ``Story of September 11'' crafted by President George W. Bush in his first four nationally televised speeches after the events of that day. I explore how this melodramatic tale contains multiple and interlocking reflections of emotion codes which encourage audience members to feel in particular ways about the Good American victim and hero and the evil terrorist villain who are the primary story characters. In the conclusion I speculate about ways in which deploying elements of socially circulating ideas about emotion might encourage persuasion in large heterogeneous audiences as well as the necessities for examining emotion as discourse in other arenas of social life. My goal is to develop a model for empirically examining emotional meaning as social phenomena.	1	Donileen R. Loseke
Zhao, Wei. 2009. 'Market Institutions, Product Identities, and Valuation of California Premium Wines.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:3 525-555.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	0	This study develops an institutional approach to understand how market institutions differentiate the identities and statuses of products and producers and eventually affect the valuation of products. Quantitative and qualitative evidence drawn from the California premium wine market shows that category-based product attributes that signify exclusivity, comply with a high institutional standard, or indicate a high rank in the classification system enhance wine price. Moreover, these attributes have symbolic values in social consumption particularly in a high-tier market segment and do not necessarily function as credible quality signals. These findings reveal the institutional bases of the economic order and status hierarchy in markets and have broad theoretical implications.	1	Wei Zhao
Adkins, Daniel & Stephen Vaisey. 2009. 'Toward a Unified Stratification Theory: Structure, Genome, and Status Across Human Societies.' Sociological Theory. 27:2 99-121.	Sociological Theory	2009	4	While social scientists and geneticists have a shared interest in the personal characteristics instrumental to status attainment, little has been done to integrate these disparate perspectives. This is unfortunate, as the perspectives offer complementary insights, which, if properly combined, stand to substantially improve understanding of the stratification process. This article synthesizes research from the social sciences and genetics to develop a multistage theory of how social structure moderates the influence of the genome on status outcomes. Its thesis is that the strength of the genome's influence on status is primarily moderated by two properties of social structure-levels of resource inequality and social mobility. Thus, it is theorized that under conditions of low inequality and high social mobility, the influence of the genome on status will be high relative to conditions of high inequality and low social mobility. The essential logic is (1) as inequality increases, the characteristics and abilities intrinsically useful in status attainment are increasingly influenced by individuals' social backgrounds and decreasingly determined by their genomes; and (2) as social closure and inequality increase, the utility of these characteristics and abilities to status attainment is diminished. In sum, a model of status attainment is developed proposing that while both genome and social background influence the status attainment process, the relative importance of these factors is determined by the surrounding structure of the society.	2	Daniel E.

York, Richard & Philip Mancus. 2009. 'Critical Human Ecology: Historical Materialism and Natural Laws.' Sociological Theory. 27:2 122-149.	Sociological Theory	2009	8	We lay the foundations for a critical human ecology (CHE) that combines the strengths of the biophysical human ecology tradition in environmental sociology with those of historical materialism. We show the strengths of a critically informed human ecology by addressing four key meta-theoretical issues: materialist versus idealist approaches in the social sciences, dialectical versus reductionist analyses, the respective importance of historical and ahistorical causal explanations, and the difference between structural and functional interpretations of phenomena. CHE breaks with the idealism of Western Marxism, which dominated academic neo-Marxist thought in the latter half of the 20th century, and advocates instead the pursuit of a materialist, scientific methodology in dialectical perspective for the explanation of social and ecological change. In turn, this project also involves a critique of the ahistorical and functionalist tendencies of traditional human ecology, while sharing human ecology's basic starting point: the ecological embeddedness of human societies.	2	Richard York; Philip Mancus
Campbell, Bradley. 2009. 'Genocide as Social Control.' Sociological Theory. 27:2 150-172.	Sociological Theory	2009	12	Genocide is defined here as organized and unilateral mass killing on the basis of ethnicity. While some have focused on genocide as a type of deviance, most genocide is also social control-a response to behavior itself defined as deviant. As such, it can be explained as a part of a general theory of social control. Black's (1998) theories of social control explain the handling of conflicts with their social geometry-that is, with the social characteristics of those involved in the conflict. Here, Blackian theories of social control are extended to specify the social geometry of genocide as follows: genocide varies directly with immobility, cultural distance, relational distance, functional independence, and inequality; and it is greater in a downward direction than in an upward or lateral direction. This theory of genocide can be applied to numerous genocides throughout history, and it is capable of ordering much of the known variation in genocide-such as when and where it occurs, how severe it is, and who participates.	1	Bradley Campbell
Silber, Ilana. 2009. 'Bourdieu's Gift to Gift Theory: an Unacknowledged Trajectory.' Sociological Theory. 27:2 173-190.	Sociological Theory	2009	6	This article offers to unravel lines of both continuity and change in Bourdieu's repeated return to the topic of the gift throughout his intellectual career. While this periodical revisiting of the gift may seem at first like mere repetition, a closer reading reveals three successive and cumulative phases in his gift theory, each adding a new layer of analytical and normative inflections. Emerging from these three phases is a trajectory marked by systematic theoretical consolidation but also growing dilemmas and inner tensions, even to the point of self-contradiction: starting from a critical debunking of the disinterested gift as sincere but obfuscating fiction, it culminates with a positive, prescriptive valorization of disinterestedness as something which needs be cultivated in our very own times. Challenging his vision, as it were, ``from within,'' these inner tensions and developments amount to an intriguing, inverted case of Bourdieu's own idea of ``double truth,'' all the more significant since it pertains to a topic that he defined as playing a paradigmatic function in his general theoretical approach.	1	Ilana F.

Gross, Neil & Solon Simmons. 2009. 'the Religiosity of American College and University Professors.' Sociology of Religion. 70:2 101-129.	Sociology of Religion	2009	13	For more than a century most U.S. colleges and universities have functioned as secular institutions. But how religious are American college and university faculty in their personal lives? We answer this question by analyzing data from a new, nationally representative survey of the American professoriate. Contrary to the view that religious skepticism predominates in the academy, we find that the majority of professors, even at elite research institutions, are religious believers. We go on to examine the distribution of faculty religiosity across institutions, fields, and other variables, and identify a number of issues that future research-sensitive to the fact that religious faith and academic life, at least in the American context, are by no means mutually exclusive-should take up.	2	Neil Gross; Solon Simmons
Kalir, Barak. 2009. 'Finding Jesus in the Holy Land and Taking Him to China: Chinese Temporary Migrant Workers in Israel Converting to Evangelical Christianity.' Sociology of Religion. 70:2 130-156.	Sociology of Religion	2009	3	The article describes and probes the conversion of Chinese temporary migrant workers in Israel to evangelical Christianity. Since 1995 thousands of Chinese workers have been recruited, mainly from villages across Fujian, for construction work in Israel. In 1998 an evangelical church was established in Tel Aviv, and its personnel evangelize with considerable success among Chinese workers. The work visa of Chinese workers in Israel is limited to a maximum of five years. Consequently, their church membership is limited in duration, and the church plays no role in the facilitation of migrants' settlement. The constricted role of the church forcefully raises the question of why Chinese workers convert to Christianity. This article draws attention to the impact of conversion on the life of Chinese workers upon their return to China. The article argues that a conversion to Christianity in Israel permits Chinese temporary migrants to accumulate cultural, symbolic, and social capital, which can be effectively deployed in China.	1	Barak Kalir
Goldstein, Warren. 2009. 'Secularization Patterns in the Old Paradigm.' Sociology of Religion. 70:2 157-178.	Sociology of Religion	2009	3	R. Stephen Warner argues that the master narrative in the old paradigm of sociology of religion is ``linear secularization'' while in the new paradigm it is ``revival and routinization.'' This article reexamines the old paradigm to see whether Warner's characterization of it is true. Not only do most of the theories of secularization in the old paradigm not follow a straight line but there is broad agreement among its members that secularization is not a linear process. One can find three other patterns in the old paradigm: the cyclical/spiral, the dialectical, and the paradoxical. This paper argues that a dialectical understanding of the process of secularization, which is contained in the old paradigm, alleviates the criticism wrongly made of it by Warner. A dialectical understanding helps make sense of how secularization and sacralization can occur at the same time.	1	Warren S. Goldstein
Hamilton, V., Timothy Daaleman, Christianna Williams & Sheryl Zimmerman. 2009. 'the Context of Religious and Spiritual Care at the End of Life in Long-term Care Facilities.' Sociology of Religion. 70:2 179-195.	Sociology of Religion	2009	0	Despite the increasing numbers of Americans who die in nursing homes (NHs) and residential care/assisted living (RC/AL) facilities, and the importance of religious and spiritual needs as one approaches death, little is known about how these needs are met for dying individual in long-term care (LTC) institutional settings. This study compared receipt of religious and spiritual help in four types of LTC settings: NHs, smaller (< 16 beds) RC/AL facilities, traditional RC/AL facilities, and new-model RC/AL facilities. Data were also available for religious affiliation of the facilities, size, and provision of religious and hospice services. Controlling for such factors, the importance of religion/spirituality to the decedent was the strongest predictor of the decedent's receipt of spiritual help. In addition, new-model RC/AL facilities were significantly more likely to provide help for religious and spiritual needs of decedent residents than other RC/AL types, but did not differ significantly from NHs.	4	V.

Schwalbe, Michael. 2009. 'Framing the Self.' Symbolic Interaction. 32:3 178-183.	Symbolic Interaction	2009	0	The meaning of a photograph depends on the story we tell about it. In the case of portraits, these narrative frames shape the self we impute to the sitter. The interiority of the portrait subject, the inner character we imagine is revealed in the photograph, is a result of what we know about photographic portraits, about the sitter, about the photo grapher, and about the context in which the image was made. Likewise in everyday life, the selves we impute to others are inflected by similar processes of narrative framing. Who we are known to be depends not only on self-presentations but on the stories within which those self presentations are placed.	1	Michael Schwalbe

Symbolic Interaction	2009	2	Howard Becker wrote that art is constructed, and understood, according to conventions. However, Becker does not adequately explain how artists negotiate historical circumstances affecting their work. Using the southern Italian phenomenon of tarantism and its music, I address how contemporary musicians employ conventions to transform sounds with deviant connotations. The alteration of musical conventions reflects material social conditions in the Salento region and provides insight into the formation of a Salentinian cultural movement's ideology. By accounting for how social groups contend with history, I argue that sociologists must reconsider the theory of artistic conventions.	1	Lee Robert Blackstone
Isaakyan, Irina. 2009. 'Cyclops Cave.' Symbolic Interaction. 32:3 207-235.	Symbolic Interaction	2009	1	Written in the post-structural traditions of symbolic interactionism, Cyclops Cave is a biographic-interview-based and fact-and-fictionplotted ethnodrama of anti-Semitism in Soviet higher education. This project is premised on the theories of the ``social self'' - namely, the ``looking-glass racialized self,'' constructed by the dominant ethnic ``supremacy,'' and the theories of racial stigma as an outcome of the racialized ``me'' production. Showing the stigma experiences of former Soviet Jewish academics from 1970 to the 1980s, the play adds a new illuminative and self-interpretive case of a race-situated symbolic interaction and deconstructs the `` root image'' of Soviet anti-Semitism through interpreting the informants' stigma incidents and interactional conflicts between their ``selfhood'' symbols.	1	Irina L.

Kleiner, Sibyl. 2009. 'Thinking With the Mind, Syncing With the Body: Ballet as Symbolic and Nonsymbolic Interaction.' Symbolic Interaction. 32:3 236-259.	Symbolic Interaction	2009	2	Symbolic interactionist theory describes self-consciousness as arising through symbolic interaction. I use one empirical case, ballet training, to suggest that symbolic interaction can, by producing self-consciousness, cultivate unself-consciousness. Using in-depth interviews with twenty-three individuals reporting on training experiences in six countries and twenty-three American states, I show that dancers can learn, through self-conscious symbolic interaction, how it feels to embody what an audience sees, as they strive to train their bodies to portray an institutionalized aesthetic. The embodiment of technique facilitates a markedly unself-conscious ``flow'' experience while performing. In contrast, having an acute awareness of embodying an incompatible physiology inhibits flow and often motivates dancers to self-select out of ballet. These interactionist sources of ``nonsymbolic'' interaction both evoke and suppress ``mind'' through social interaction.	1	Sibyl Kleiner
Rodgers, Diane. 2009. 'the Use of the Talmudic Format for the Presentation of Qualitative Research.' Symbolic Interaction. 32:3 260-281.	Symbolic Interaction	2009	0	In this article, I propose to adapt the Talmud, a Jewish religious text, for the written representation of qualitative research. The form and the style of argumentation in and engendered by the Talmud can be adapted to present qualitative methods in a way that transcends the limitations of conventional formats. In addition, this format requires even greater participation in the act of reading. Because the Talmudic format uniquely addresses the difficulties involved in representing everyday life, I argue that adapting the format of the Talmud is ideal for giving voice, for presenting multiple and competing narratives alongside documents, and for further problematizing any simple notion of truth and authority.	1	Diane M.

Social Compass. 56:2 249-262.	Social Compass	2009	0	The author deals with the creation of forms of worship in the English and French languages ( in New Zealand and Tahiti, respectively) within the so-called ``historical'' Protestant churches established in Polynesia from the 19th century. These forms of worship were officially designed to attract young children, who no longer speak Polynesian languages, but in practice they serve as testing grounds for new ways of organising and celebrating the religion that come closer to the Evangelical and Pentecostal style. The aim is to show how the issue of language, which has created a generation gap, reflects the changes that have taken place in the religious practices of Polynesian Protestantism. The question that ultimately emerges concerns the role of these forms of worship in the context of the younger generation's growing indifference to the historical churches: Have they brought about a reaffiliation or are they the first step towards religious disaffiliation?	1	Gwendoline Malogne-Fer
Kalev, Alexandra. 2009. 'Cracking the Glass Cages? Restructuring and Ascriptive Inequality at Work.' American Journal of Sociology. 114:6 1591-1643.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	23	This study shows that the organization of work, particularly the structure of jobs, can sustain or erode gender and racial disadvantage. Restructuring work around team work and weaker job boundaries can improve women's and minorities' visibility and reduce stereotyping and thus should reduce their career disadvantage. Proponents of bureaucratic formalization argue, in contrast, that relaxing formal job definitions and emphasizing social relations at work will deepen ascriptive disadvantage. The reorganization of work in corporate America over the last two decades provides a test case. Using unique data on the life histories of more than 800 organizations, the author examines whether alleviating job segregation leads to better career outcomes for women and minorities. This study finds that when employers adopt popular team and training programs that increase cross-functional collaboration, ascriptive inequality declines. Similar programs that do not transcend job boundaries do not lead to such increases. The results point to different effects at the intersection of gender and race.	1	Alexandra Kalev
Kollmeyer, Christopher. 2009. 'Explaining Deindustrialization: How Affluence, Productivity Growth, and Globalization Diminish Manufacturing Employment.' American Journal of Sociology. 114:6 1644-1674.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	9	This study analyzes why the world's most economically advanced countries have deindustrialized over the last few decades. Previous research focuses on three causal factors: (1) rising consumer affluence and its propensity to increase demand for services more than for manufactured goods, (2) faster productivity growth in the manufacturing sector relative to other sectors, and (3) expanding trade linkages between the North and the South of the global economy. The relative importance of these factors, however, is not fully understood, because previous research has not tested all of these explanations simultaneously nor considered the indirect channels through which global trade may cause deindustrialization. This study tests the three factors with two-way fixed-effects regression models and panel data on 18 OECD countries from 1970 to 2003. The results indicate that each factor makes significant contributions to deindustrialization, and that global trade exerts both direct and indirect effects on employment patterns in economically advanced countries, but that the single greatest factor comes from the steadily rising affluence of consumers in these countries.	1	Christopher Kollmeyer
Vaisey, Stephen. 2009. 'Motivation and Justification: a Dual-process Model of Culture in Action.' American Journal of Sociology. 114:6 1675-1715.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	70	This article presents a new model of culture in action. Although most sociologists who study culture emphasize its role in post hoc sense making, sociologists of religion and social psychologists tend to focus on the role beliefs play in motivation. The dual-process model integrates justificatory and motivational approaches by distinguishing between ``discursive'' and ``practical'' modes of culture and cognition. The author uses panel data from the National Study of Youth and Religion to illustrate the model's usefulness. Consistent with its predictions, he finds that though respondents cannot articulate clear principles of moral judgment, their choice from a list of moral-cultural scripts strongly predicts later behavior.	1	Stephen Vaisey
Vasi, Ion & David Strang. 2009. 'Civil Liberty in America: the Diffusion of Municipal Bill of Rights Resolutions After the Passage of the Usa Patriot Act.' American Journal of Sociology. 114:6 1716-1764.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	5	In the years since the 9/11 terrorist attacks, some 400 local governments passed ``Bill of Rights'' resolutions in opposition to the USA PATRIOT Act. Event history analyses show that cities with progressive profiles were markedly quicker to pass such resolutions. These effects are strongest in the early phase of the Bill of Rights campaign, a period for which there is also robust evidence of contagious influence among nearby cities. The authors argue that the campaign's success lies in the miscibility of multiple movements-the ability of groups with different beliefs, agendas, and traditions to combine around a common goal.

American Journal of Sociology	2009	20	Drawing on structural racism and urban disadvantage approaches, this article posits a broad influence of citywide racial residential segregation on levels of violent crime across all urban neighborhoods regardless of their racial/ethnic composition. Multilevel models based on data from the National Neighborhood Crime Study for 7,622 neighborhoods in 79 cities throughout the United States reveal that segregation is positively associated with violent crime for white and various types of nonwhite neighborhoods. Nonetheless, there is a lack of parity in violence across these types of communities reflecting the larger racialized social system in which whites are able to use their privileged position to reside in the most advantaged neighborhoods, while African-Americans and Latinos live in the most disadvantaged urban communities and therefore bear the brunt of urban criminal violence.	3	Lauren J.

Shor, Eran & Dalit Simchai. 2009. 'Incest Avoidance, the Incest Taboo, and Social Cohesion: Revisiting Westermarck and the Case of the Israeli Kibbutzim.' American Journal of Sociology. 114:6 1803-1842.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	8	During the past 50 years, a consensus has been forming around Edward Westermarck's idea that incest avoidance results from an aversion that develops when individuals are brought up in propinquity. The argument here presented counters this emerging consensus. Reexamining the case of the Israeli kibbutzim, the authors show that individuals who grew up in the kibbutzim's communal education system were in fact often attracted to their peers, and only rarely did they develop sexual aversion toward these peers. This article offers an alternative explanation to the problem of incest avoidance and the incest taboo, one that brings sociological factors back into the picture.	2	Eran Shor; Dalit Simchai
Strully, Kate. 2009. 'Job Loss and Health in the Us Labor Market.' Demography. 46:2 221-246.	Demography	2009	29	While U.S. unemployment rates remain low, rates of job loss are high and rising. Job loss is also becoming increasing v common in more advantaged, white-collar occupations. This article is concerned with how these patterns impact the health of U.S. workers. Drawing on recent data from the U.S. Panel Study of Income Dynamics, I find that job loss harms health, beyond sicker people being more likely to lose their jobs. Respondents who lost jobs bill Were, reemployed at the survey faced an increased risk of developing new health conditions; they were not, however, more likely to describe their health in negative let-ins. This suggests that recent job ``churning'' within the United States (i.e., high rates of job loss but low unemployment) may impact certain health outcomes but not others. I find no evidence that the health consequences of job loss differ across white- and blue-collar occupations, although health-related selection out of jobs appears stronger within the blue-collar category.	1	Kate W.

Demography	2009	16	We present new estimates of unwed fathers' ability to pay child support. Prior research relied oil surveys that drastically undercounted nonresident unwed fathers and provided no link to their children who lived in separate households. To overcome these limitations, previous research assumed assortative mating and that each mother partnered with one father who was actually eligible to pay support and had no other child support obligations. Because the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study contains data oil couples, multiple-partner fertility, and a rich array of other previously unmeasured characteristics of fathers, it is uniquely suited to address the limitations of previous research. We also use an improved method of dealing with missing data. Our findings suggest that previous research overestimated the aggregate ability of unwed nonresident fathers to pay child support by 33\% to 60\%.	2	Marilyn Sinkewicz; Irwin Garfinkel

Demography	2009	57	Although much research has focused on how imprisonment transforms the life course of disadvantaged black men, researchers have paid little attention to how parental imprisonment alters the social experience of childhood. This article estimates the risk of parental imprisonment by age 14 for black and white children born in 1978 and 1990. This article also estimates the risk of parental imprisonment for children whose parents did not finish high school, finished high school only, or attended college. Results show the following: (1) 1 in 40 white children born in 1978 and I in 25 white children born in 1990 had a parent imprisoned; (2) 1 in 7 black children born in 1978 and I in 4 black children born in 1990 had a parent imprisoned; (3) inequality in the risk of parental imprisonment between white children of college-educated parents and all other children is growing; and (4) by age 14, 50.5\% of black children born in 1990 to high school dropouts had a father imprisoned These estimates, robustness checks, and extensions to longitudinal data indicate that parental imprisonment has emerged as a novel-and distinctively American-childhood risk that is concentrated among black children and children of low-education parents.	1	Christopher Wildeman
Johnston, David, Michael Nicholls, Manisha Shah & Michael Shields. 2009. 'Nature's Experiment? Handedness and Early Childhood Development.' Demography. 46:2 281-301.	Demography	2009	12	In recent years, a large body of research has investigated the various factors affecting child development and the consequent impact of child development on future educational and labor market outcomes. In this article, we contribute to this literature by investigating the effect of handedness on child development. This is an important issue given that around 10\% of the world's population is left-handed and given recent research demonstrating that child development strongly affects adult outcomes. Using a large, nationally representative sample of young children, we find that the probability of a child being left-handed is not significantly related to child health at birth, family composition, parental employment, or household income. We also find robust evidence that left-handed (and mixed-handed) children perform significantly worse in nearly all measures of development than right-handed children, with the relative disadvantage being larger for boys than girls. Importantly these differentials cannot be explained by different socioeconomic characteristics of the household, parental attitudes, or investments in learning resources.	4	David W.

Cameron, Lisa & Jenny Williams. 2009. 'Is the Relationship Between Socioeconomic Status and Health Stronger for Older Children in Developing Countries?.' Demography. 46:2 303-324.	Demography	2009	4	Recent research on the relationship between child health and income in developed countries reveals a positive gradient that is more pronounced for older children, suggesting that the impact of income upon health accumulates. This article examines whether the same is true in a developing country. Using data from the Indonesian Family Life Survey on children aged 0 to 14 years, we find that although low income adversely affects health, its impact does not differ by age. This finding is robust to the use of both subjective and objective health measures, controlling for selective mortality, the use of alternative measures of households' resources, and the inclusion of indicators of health at birth and parental health. One explanation for the constancy of the health-income relationship that we explore is the dominant role played by acute illness in determining the general health status of children in a developing-country context compared with the more central role played by chronic conditions in developed countries.	2	Lisa Cameron; Jenny Williams
Oster, Emily. 2009. 'Proximate Sources of Population Sex Imbalance in India.' Demography. 46:2 325-339.	Demography	2009	15	There is a population sex imbalance in India. Despite a consensus that this imbalance is due to excess female mortality, the specific source of this excess mortality remains poorly understood. I use microdata on child survival in India to analyze the proximate sources of the sex imbalance. I address two questions: when in life does the sex imbalance arise, and what health or nutritional investments are specifically responsible for its appearance? I present a new methodology that uses microdata on child survival. This methodology, explicitly takes into account both the possibility of naturally occurring sex differences in survival and possible differences between investments in their importance for survival. Consistent with existing literature, I find significant excess female mortality in childhood, particularly between the ages of I and 5, and argue that the sex imbalance that exists by age 5 is large enough to explain virtually the entire imbalance in the population. Within this age group, sex differences in vaccinations explain between 20\% and 30\% of excess female mortality, malnutrition explains an additional 20\%, and differences in treatment for illness play a smaller role. Together, these investments account for approximately 50\% of the sex imbalance in mortality in India.	1	Emily Oster

Demography	2009	17	Using harmonized longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS), the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP), and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY), we trace career prospects after motherhood for five cohorts of American, British, and West German women around the 1960s. We establish wage penalties for motherhood between 9\% and 18\% per child, with wage losses among American and British mothers being lower than those experienced by mothers it? Germany. Labor market mechanisms generating the observed wage penalty for motherhood differ markedly across countries, however. For British and American women, work interruptions and subsequent mobility into mother friendly jobs fully account for mothers' wage losses. In contrast, respective penalties are considerably smaller it? Germany, yet we observe a substantial residual wage penalty that is unaccounted for by mothers' observable labor market behavior We interpret this finding as indicating a comparatively more pronounced role for statistical discrimination against mothers in the German labor market.	2	Markus Gangl; Andrea Ziefle
Wolf, Douglas & Thomas Gill. 2009. 'Modeling Transition Rates Using Panel Current-status Data: How Serious Is the Bias?.' Demography. 46:2 371-386.	Demography	2009	7	Studies of disability dynamics and active life expectancy often rely on transition rates or probabilities that are estimated using panel survey data in which respondents report on current health or functional status. If respondents are contacted at intervals of one or two years, then relatively short periods of disability or recovery between surveys may be missed. Much published research that uses such data assumes that there arc, no unrecorded transitions, applying event-history techniques to estimate transition rates. In recent years, a different approach based on embedded Markov chains has received growing use. We assessed the performance of both approaches, using as a criterion their ability to reproduce the parameters of a ``true'' model based on panel data collected at one-month intervals. Neither of the widely used approaches performs particularly well, and neither is uniformly superior to the other.	2	Douglas A. Wolf; Thomas M. Gill
Smith, James. 2009. 'Reconstructing Childhood Health Histories.' Demography. 46:2 387-403.	Demography	2009	26	This article provides evidence about the quality of retrospective childhood health histories given to respondents in the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) and the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID). Even though information on early life health events is critical, there is legitimate skepticism about the ability of older respondents to remember specific health problems that they had during childhood The evidence presented in this article suggests that this view is too negative. Respondents appear to remember salient childhood events about themselves, such as the illnesses they had during childhood, quite well. Moreover; these physical and psychological childhood health events are important correlates of adult health during middle age.	1	James P. Smith
Chi, Guangqing. 2009. 'Can Knowledge Improve Population Forecasts at Subcounty Levels?.' Demography. 46:2 405-427.	Demography	2009	12	Recent developments in urban and regional planning require more accurate population forecasts at subcounty levels, as well as a consideration of inlet-actions among population growth, traffic flow, land use, and environmental impacts. However; the extrapolation methods, currently the most often used demographic forecasting techniques for subcounty areas, cannot meet the demand This study tests a knowledge-based regression approach, which hay been successfully used for forecasts at the national level, for subcounty population forecasting. In particular, this study applies four regression models that incorporate demographic characteristics, socioeconomic conditions, transportation accessibility, natural amenities, and land development to examine the population change since 1970 and to prepare the 1990-based forecast of year 2000 population at the minor civil division level in Wisconsin. The findings indicate that this approach does not outperform the extrapolation projections. Although the regression methods produce more precise projections, the least biased projections are often generated by one of the extrapolation techniques. The performance of the knowledge-based regression methods is discounted at subcounty levels by temporal instability and the scale effect. The regression coefficients exhibit a statistically significant level of temporal instability across the estimation and projection periods and tend to change more rapidly at finer geographic scales.	1	Guangqing Chi

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	8	The growth of single-parent families constitutes one of the most dramatic and most studied social changes of the 20th century. Evolving attitudes toward these families have received less attention. This paper explores depictions of these families in representative samples of popular magazine (N = 474) and social science journal (N = 202) articles. Critical depictions of divorce plummeted between 1900 and 1998, a trend stemming not from any increase in favorable depictions but from the virtual disappearance of normative debate. Such de facto acceptance did not extend to nonmarital childbearing, however, depictions of which were almost as likely to be critical at the century's end as at its beginning. These trends illustrate Americans' ambivalent embrace of single-parent families as a reality but not an ideal.	1	Margaret L. Usdansky

We also examine whether joint employment patterns influence levels of help. Persistent gender differences are identified in levels of emotional support to parents and in-laws: Women spend more time than men giving this help. There are no gender differences in levels of unpaid task assistance or financial assistance to parents or in-laws. Individuals in single-earner couples, however, provide greater levels of unpaid task assistance to in-laws and financial assistance to parents than individuals in dual-earner couples. Furthermore, financial assistance to parents is positively linked to work hours.	2	Noelle Chesley; Kyle Poppie

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	2	The predictions of resource dilution and sibship gender composition models of educational investment are tested using the Japanese Nationwide Survey on Families (N = 6,985). Japan is an important case because of its postindustrial economy, coupled with high levels of dependence on parental investment to attend a university and persisting gender inequality in educational attainment. In previous between-family analyses of educational attainment in Japan, boys were found to drain resources from their sisters. The within-family, multilevel models of parental educational investments in this analysis show that girls with college-educated brothers fare better than their peers without brothers. An alternative model incorporating the educational investments received by brothers in the same family is proposed.	1	Kristen Schultz Lee

In multivariate OLS models, we find mothers' available support is negatively associated with children's behavior problems and positively associated with prosocial behavior in both data sets; associations between available support and children's internalizing and prosocial behaviors attenuate but remain robust in residualized change models. Overall, results support the hypothesis that the availability of a private safety net is positively associated with children's socioemotional adjustment.	3	Rebecca M.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	19	We investigate the link between premarital cohabitation and trajectories of subsequent marital quality using random effects growth curve models and repeated measures of marital quality from married women in the NLSY-79 (N = 3,598). We find that premarital cohabitors experience lower quality marital relationships on average, but this is driven by cohabitors with nonmarital births. Premarital cohabitors without nonmarital births report the same marital quality as women who did not cohabit before marriage. Nonmarital childbearing is more strongly associated with lower subsequent marital quality for White women than for Black or Hispanic women. Marital quality declines at similar rates for all couples regardless of cohabitation or nonmarital childbearing status. These findings are robust to numerous alternative model specifications.	2	Laura Tach; Sarah Halpern-Meekin

Using a life history interview methodology and interpretive framework, it examines the orientations toward marital commitment for a sample of women and men, single and married, between the ages of 28 and 35 (N = 75). Specifically, it elaborates a multidimensional view of marital commitment with attention to two multifaceted components, one value rational and the other practical. Borrowing concepts from exchange and identity models of commitment, it analyzes interpretive processes involved in their construction. Some preliminary comments on the role social position plays in shaping constructions of marital commitment are articulated and the implications of this model discussed.	1	Stephanie Ellen Byrd

Little research, however, has examined norms about IPV in same-sex relationships. Using a fractional factorial (experimental vignette) design, we conducted random-digit-dialed interviews in four languages with 3,679 community-residing adults. Multivariate analyses of responses to 14,734 vignettes suggest that IPV against gay male, lesbian, and heterosexual women is more likely than that against heterosexual men to be considered illegal and that it should be illegal, police called, and a stay-away order issued. Regardless of gender and sexual orientation, the type of abuse and whether a weapon was displayed are the strongest predictors of respondents' judgments about whether a behavior is illegal and merits a range of societal interventions.	2	Susan B.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	6	We investigate change in the association between premarital cohabitation and the risk of separation. Using retrospective marriage history data from the first wave (2001) of the Household Income and Labor Dynamics in Australian survey, we examine 6,210 first marriages formed between 1945 and 2000. We find the association between premarital cohabitation and separation is changing. The increased risk of separation for cohabitors compared to noncohabitors diminishes each year for marriages before 1988. This association then reverses for marriages after 1988, where noncohabitors have an increased risk of separation. Our results indicate that, for more recent marriages, premarital cohabitation reduces the risk of separation; more research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms for this reversal.	2	Belinda Hewitt; David De

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	1	This report examines whether the presence of children in marriage differentially influences the risk of wives or husbands initiating separation. The analytic sample consists of 9,118 first marriages from the Households, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia survey (2001). Using event history and competing risks analysis, I find weak evidence that wives are less likely than husbands to initiate when they have infants, and husbands are less likely than wives to initiate when children are school age or older. Overall, the results show that children deter marital separation for both wives and husbands, indicating that gender differences in the decision to separate are likely attributable to other factors such as a willingness to remain in an unhappy marriage.	1	Belinda Hewitt

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	12	This study examined the role of three spiritual responses to divorce for psychological adjustment: appraising the event as a sacred loss/desecration, engaging in adaptive spiritual coping, and experiencing spiritual struggles. A sample of 100 adults (55\% female) was recruited through public divorce records. Most appraised their divorce as a sacred loss/desecration (74\%), experienced spiritual struggles (78\%), and engaged in adaptive spiritual coping (88\%). Appraisals of sacred loss/desecration and spiritual struggles were tied to higher levels of depression. Adaptive spiritual coping was tied to greater posttraumatic growth. Spiritual coping and struggles each contributed uniquely to adjustment beyond parallel forms of nonspiritual coping and struggles and mediated links between viewing the divorce as a sacred loss/desecration and depression.	3	Elizabeth J.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	10	Social background has historically been recognized as a major factor influencing family behavior, though recent work has largely emphasized racial/ethnic influences. Here we use 1994 - 1995 and 2001 - 2002 Add Health data to examine the cohabitation, first marriage, and first birth experience of young women. In a multistate life table context, hypothetical cohorts specified in terms of race and mother's education are followed, from age 11 to age 24, as they move through 6 family-related statuses. The results indicate that, for both Black and White women, a higher level of maternal education is generally associated with less cohabitation, less marriage, fewer first births, and a higher percentage of women who experience none of those transitions before age 24. Racial and social background differences are conceptually and empirically distinct. Because mother's education is associated with substantially different trajectories of early family behavior for both Blacks and Whites, we argue that social background merits increased attention in research on contemporary American family patterns.	4	Robert Schoen; Nancy S.

We also consider whether the specter of AIDS is shaping ideals about marriage. By combining survey data (N = 1,087) and in-depth interviews (N = 133) with young Malawians from the Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change Project, we show that looking for and finding a suitable spouse are linked to sexual behaviors and, thus, HIV risks. Moreover, concerns about contracting HIV are closely tied to the ideal characteristics of a future spouse. Our findings draw long-overdue attention to the importance of marital aspirations in understanding adolescent sexual behaviors and risks in the era of AIDS.	3	Shelley Clark; Michelle Poulin; Hans-Peter Kohler

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	8	Family migration has a negative impact on women's employment status. Using longitudinal data from the British Household Panel Survey (3,617 women; 22,354 women/wave observations) we consider two neglected issues. First, instead of relying on the distance moved to distinguish employment-related migrations, we use information on the reason for moving, allowing us to separate employment-related moves, stimulated by the man or the woman, from other moves. Second, we consider selection effects and the role of state dependence in relation to women's employment status prior to moving. Moving for the sake of the man's job has a significant negative effect on subsequent employment status for previously employed women. Women who were not employed previously benefited only slightly from family migration.	3	Paul Boyle; Zhiqiang Feng; Vernon Gayle
Robins, Garry, Pip Pattison & Peng Wang. 2009. 'Closure, Connectivity and Degree Distributions: Exponential Random Graph (p*) Models for Directed Social Networks.' Social Networks. 31:2 105-117.	Social Networks	2009	32	The new higher order specifications for exponential random graph models introduced by Snijders et al. [Snijders,T.A.B., Rattison, RE., Robins G.L., Handcock. M., 2006. New specifications for exponential random graph models. Sociological Methodology 36,99-153] exhibit substantial improvements in model fit compared with the commonly used Markov random graph models. Snijders et al., however, concentrated on non-directed graphs, with only limited extensions to directed graphs. In particular, they presented a transitive closure parameter based on path shortening. In this paper, we explain the theoretical and empirical advantages in generalizing to additional closure effects. We propose three new triadic-based parameters to represent different versions of triadic closure: cyclic effects; transitivity based on shared choices of partners; and transitivity based on shared popularity. We interpret the last two effects as forms of structural homophily, where ties emerge because nodes share a form of localized structural equivalence. We show that, for some datasets, the path shortening parameter is insufficient for practical modeling, whereas the structural homophily parameters can produce useful models with distinctive interpretations. We also introduce corresponding lower order effects for multiple two-path connectivity. We show by example that the in- and out-degree distributions may be better modeled when star-based parameters are supplemented with parameters for the number of isolated nodes, sources (nodes with zero in-degrees) and sinks (nodes with zero out-degrees). Inclusion of a Markov mixed star parameter may also help model the correlation between in- and out-degrees. We select some 50 graph features to be investigated in goodness of fit diagnostics, covering a variety of important network properties including density, reciprocity, geodesic distributions, degree distributions, and various forms of closure. As empirical illustrations, we develop models for two sets of organizational network data: a trust network within a training group, and a work difficulty network within a government instrumentality.	3	Garry Robins; Pip Pattison; Peng Wang

Social Networks	2009	6	Economic and sociological exchange theories predict divisions of exchange benefits given an assumed fixed network of exchange relations. Since network structure has been found to have a large impact on actors' payoffs, actors have strong incentives for network change. We answer the question what happens to both the network structure and actor payoffs when myopic actors change their links in order to maximize their payoffs. We investigate the networks that are stable, the networks that are efficient or egalitarian with varying tie costs, and the occurrence of social dilemmas. Only few networks are stable over a wide range of tie costs, and all of them can be divided into two types: efficient networks consisting of only dyads and at most one isolate, and Pareto efficient and egalitarian cycles with an odd number of actors. Social dilemmas are observed in even-sized networks at low tie costs.	4	Gonul Dogan; Marcel A. Assen; Arnout Rijt; Vincent Buskens

Social Networks	2009	14	In order to be able to devise successful strategies for destabilizing covert organizations it is vital to recognize and understand their structural properties. Every covert organization faces the constant dilemma of staying secret and ensuring the necessary coordination between its members. Using elements from multi-objective optimization and bargaining game theory we analyze which communication structures are optimal in the sense of providing a balanced tradeoff between secrecy and operational efficiency. For several different secrecy and information scenarios this tradeoff is analyzed considering the set of connected graphs of given order as possible communication structures. Assuming uniform exposure probability of individuals in the network we show that the optimal communication structure corresponds to either a network with a central individual (the star graph) or an all-to-all network (the complete graph) depending on the link detection probability, which is the probability that communication between individuals will be detected. If the probability that an individual is exposed as member of the network depends on the information hierarchy determined by the structure of the graph, the optimal communication structure corresponds to a reinforced ring or wheel graph in case of an information measure based on average performance. In worst case performance with respect to information it can be seen that windmill wing graphs approximate optimal structures. Finally we give an example how optimal structures change when considering a non-balanced tradeoff between secrecy and operational efficiency.	3	Roy Lindelauf; Peter Borm; Herbert Hamers

There was a negative relationship between mean emotional closeness and network size, for both related and unrelated networks. Further, there was a distinct upper bound on total network size. These results suggest that there are constraints both on the absolute number of individuals that ego can maintain in the network, and also on the emotional intensity of the relationships that ego can maintain with those individuals.	4	Sam G.

Emanuelson, Pamela & David Willer. 2009. 'One-shot Exchange Networks and the Shadow of the Future.' Social Networks. 31:2 147-154.	Social Networks	2009	0	From the Prisoner's Dilemma and other games, it is well known that strategy selection in one-shot games can be very different from that in iterated games. Because exchange structures were studied only as iterated games, whether one-shot structures differ was not known. Nor have exchange theories previously considered whether events in structures Would be different if studied as one-shot games. This paper offers new theory to predict one-shot exchange structures and one-shot experiments to test that theory. As predicted, the experiments found that processes and Outcomes of one-shot exchange structures are quite different from those of iterated exchange structures. For example, certain relations that are strategically used as threats in iterated exchange Structures occur very rarely in one-shot structures. It follows that power differences in one-shot structures regress from those observed for repeated structures.	2	Pamela Emanuelson; David Willer
Opsahl, Tore & Pietro Panzarasa. 2009. 'Clustering in Weighted Networks.' Social Networks. 31:2 155-163.	Social Networks	2009	55	In recent years, researchers have investigated a growing number of weighted networks where ties are differentiated according to their strength or capacity. Yet, most network measures do not take weights into consideration, and thus do not fully capture the richness of the information contained in the data. In this paper, we focus on a measure originally defined for unweighted networks: the global clustering coefficient. We propose a generalization of this coefficient that retains the information encoded in the weights of ties. We then undertake a comparative assessment by applying the standard and generalized coefficients to a number of network datasets.	2	Tore Opsahl; Pietro Panzarasa
Noy, Darren. 2009. 'When Framing Fails: Ideas, Influence, and Resources in San Francisco's Homeless Policy Field.' Social Problems. 56:2 223-242.	Social Problems	2009	9	Literature examining political framing generally focuses on the way that shared framing leads to cohesive actions and policy outcomes. Using a case study of San Francisco's homeless policy field, this article shows that shared framings among the majority of actors in the policy field did not lead to cooperative alliance among those actors nor to coherent policy based on their shared framing. To understand why shared framing failed, I examine the complex interaction between frames, influence, and material resources. While the center and the left of the policy field shared common diagnostic framings and solution-oriented prognostic framings of homelessness, the right possessed far superior material resources and political influence compared to the left. The center and left divided over different tactical prognostic framings about how to politically relate to the resources and influence of the right. These internal dynamics of the field were further amplified by the field's local institutional and national policy-making contexts. This article adds to understandings of how to map political fields, how ideas shape policy outcomes, and how meaning and materiality interact in the process of politics. Keywords: framing, policy, fields, networks, homelessness.	1	Darren Noy
Martin, Aryn & Michael Lynch. 2009. 'Counting Things and People: the Practices and Politics of Counting.' Social Problems. 56:2 243-266.	Social Problems	2009	15	Many scientific and nonscientific activities involve practices of counting. Counting is, perhaps, the most elementary of numerical practices: an ability to count is presupposed in arithmetic and other branches of mathematics, and counting also is part of innumerable everyday and specialized activities. Though it is a simple practice when considered abstractly, in specific cases counting can be quite complicated, contentious, and socially consequential. Categorical judgments determine what counts as an eligible case, instance, or datum, and these judgments can be difficult and controversial. By focusing on such difficulties, this article aims to elucidate practices that are crucial for the production and stabilization of natural and social orders. Cases discussed in the article are provisionally divided between counting ( nonhuman) things and counting people. Cases of counting things include scientific practices of counting the number of human chromosomes and forensic procedures for counting matches in DNA profiles. Cases of counting people include estimates of crowd size and counts and recounts of election ballots. Counting people not only is a matter of including an object or person in a class or group, but also involves reciprocal performances in which the counted objects are complicit in, or resistive to, the social production of counts. Variable, and otherwise troubled and contested, instances of counting are used to elucidate the numero-politics of counting: how assigning numbers to things is embedded in disciplined fields, systems of registration and surveillance, technological checks and verifications, and fragile networks of trust. Keywords: counting, numero-politics, science, classification, estimation. But counting ... is a technique that is employed daily in the most various operations of our lives. And that is why we learn to count as we do with endless practice, and merciless exactitude ... ``But is this counting only a use, then? Isn't there also some truth corresponding to this sequence?'' ... it can't be said of the series of natural numbers-that it is true, but that it is useful, and, above all, it is used.

Sharp, Shane. 2009. 'Escaping Symbolic Entrapment, Maintaining Social Identities.' Social Problems. 56:2 267-284.	Social Problems	2009	2	Symbolic entrapment - which refers to when a person is prevented from taking courses of action because these actions threaten symbolic boundaries that crucially define important and salient social identities - is a ubiquitous part of social life. Previous research suggests that individuals either remain symbolically entrapped or disavow their identities in efforts to escape. By using the case of conservative Christian victims of spousal abuse who divorced their abusive husbands yet remain conservative Christians, I theorize that people escape symbolic entrapment while also maintaining their identities using normative, transforming, and neutralizing vocabularies of motive that make certain courses of action seem appropriate in terms of a group's culture. These motives help individuals escape symbolic entrapment by relieving cognitive dissonance and by providing people with arguments that convince fellow group members of the appropriateness of action. I conclude with empirical, theoretical, and practical implications of this research. Keywords: symbolic entrapment, social identities, vocabularies of motive, intimate partner violence, conservative Christianity.	1	Shane Sharp
Watkins-Hayes, Celeste. 2009. 'Race-ing the Bootstrap Climb: Black and Latino Bureaucrats in Post-reform Welfare Offices.' Social Problems. 56:2 285-310.	Social Problems	2009	4	The substantial incorporation of people of color into government and quasi-government employment raises previously unexplored questions about the significance of race, class, and gender in street-level bureaucracies. Relying on interview data collected from black and Latino supervisors and caseworkers implementing welfare reform, I look at whether and how race and other social group memberships are deployed as tools in the delivery of casework services to black and Latino clients. Contrary to our assumptions about the level of impersonality entrenched in public bureaucracies, I find that most caseworkers and supervisors of color conceptualize and operationalize welfare reform in ways that link their goals and experiences as agency employees, members of racial communities, and implementers of social policy. They identify with the circumstances of their clients, but interpret the politics of welfare through not only racialized but also classed and gendered lenses. Consequently, they support and challenge clients of color in a variety of ways. In order to trace the origins of these strategies, I explore how the combination of institutional politics, environmental phenomenon, and black and Latino bureaucrats' personal histories contribute to their understanding of how they should do their jobs. This article suggests that not only inter-racial but also intra-racial politics inform institutional processes within street-level bureaucracies.	1	Celeste Watkins-Hayes
Desmond, Matthew & Ruth Turley. 2009. 'the Role of Familism in Explaining the Hispanic-white College Application Gap.' Social Problems. 56:2 311-334.	Social Problems	2009	9	Compared to other ethnic and racial groups, Hispanic youth are worse off in every available measure of educational achievement and attainment at the primary, secondary, and postsecondary levels. Using data from the Texas Higher Education Opportunity Project, we explore the degree to which students' preferences to stay home for college can help explain the low college application rates of Hispanic students. Among high school seniors, we find that (1) Hispanics are the most likely to report it is important to live at home during college, even those with college-educated parents; (2) net of other factors, students who indicate it is important to stay home are significantly less likely to apply to college, especially to selective institutions; and (3) taking account of the preference to stay home significantly reduces the Hispanic-white gap in applying to any college and a four-year college, and it makes the gap in applying to a selective college disappear.	2	Matthew Desmond; Ruth N.

Dougherty, Kevin & Mark Mulder. 2009. 'Congregational Responses to Growing Urban Diversity in a White Ethnic Denomination.' Social Problems. 56:2 335-356.	Social Problems	2009	0	How do congregations from a white ethnic denomination respond to growing urban diversity? Using an ecological perspective, we examine 14 Christian Reformed congregations in Southeast Grand Rapids, Michigan over a 30-year time period (1970 to 2000). We track neighborhood composition, residential patterns of congregation members, and congregation membership totals. As white residents declined in urban neighborhoods, congregations from this historically Dutch denomination had difficulty sustaining themselves as neighborhood churches. Tracing the history of these congregations revealed churches reaching beyond their neighborhoods for members as the surroundings changed. Such activities resulted in niche overlap, heightened competition, and jeopardized organizational sustainability. Older, more traditional churches in the most dramatically changing neighborhoods saw membership plummet. Newer, more suburban congregations showed greater stability. Fastest growing were mission churches originally formed to serve non-Dutch constituencies but now attracting diverse members from a wide area. Implementing organizational ecology theory, our conclusions address issues of adaptation, institutional interrelationships, and the contingent nature of competitive advantage.	2	Kevin D.

McCorkel, Jill & Jason Rodriquez. 2009. '``are You an African?'' the Politics of Self-construction in Status-based Social Movements.' Social Problems. 56:2 357-384.	Social Problems	2009	1	Current debates over identity politics hinge on the question of whether status-based social movements encourage parochialism and self-interest or create possibilities for mutual recognition across lines of difference. Our article explores this question through comparative, ethnographic study of two racially progressive social movements, ``pro-black'' abolitionism and ``conscious'' hip hop. We argue that status-based social movements not only enable collective identity, but also the personal identities or selves of their participants. Beliefs about the self create openings and obstacles to mutual recognition and progressive social action. Our analysis centers on the challenges that an influx of progressive, anti-racist whites posed to each movement. We examine first how each movement configured movement participation and racial identity and then how whites crafted strategic narratives of the self to account for their participation in a status-based movement they were not directly implicated in. We conclude with an analysis of the implications of these narratives for a critical politics of recognition.	2	Jill McCorkel; Jason Rodriquez

Sociological Inquiry. 79:2 142-162.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	10	One of the most curious aspects of the 2004 presidential election was the strength and resilience of the belief among many Americans that Saddam Hussein was linked to the terrorist attacks of September 11. Scholars have suggested that this belief was the result of a campaign of false information and innuendo from the Bush administration. We call this the information environment explanation. Using a technique of ``challenge interviews'' on a sample of voters who reported believing in a link between Saddam and 9/11, we propose instead a social psychological explanation for the belief in this link. We identify a number of social psychological mechanisms voters use to maintain false beliefs in the face of disconfirming information, and we show that for a subset of voters the main reason to believe in the link was that it made sense of the administration's decision to go to war against Iraq. We call this inferred justification: for these voters, the fact of the war led to a search for a justification for it, which led them to infer the existence of ties between Iraq and 9/11.	7	Monica Prasad; Andrew J.

Krull, Catherine & Audrey Kobayashi. 2009. 'Shared Memories, Common Vision: Generations, Sociopolitical Consciousness and Resistance Among Cuban Women.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:2 163-189.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	1	Much has been written about modern Cuba's problems, but little about what it means to be part of a society that believes in ``the Revolution'' and the possibility of a new order. The challenge is not only to understand why some Cubans do not believe but to also recognize the commitment of those who do. Based on how they identify key events in Cuban history, we focus on two distinct generations of Cuban women: an older ``Revolution'' generation and a younger ``Special Period'' generation. Analyzing transcripts from in-depth focus group conversations and face-to-face interviews, we argue that depending on their historical location, Cuban women differ both within and between generations in terms of their sociopolitical world views, especially in how they conceptualize their place in the Revolution and in their strategies of resistance throughout Cuba's current economic crisis, a period known by Cubans as the Special Period. Their words describe in detail what their beliefs mean to them, and how they live them.	2	Catherine Krull; Audrey Kobayashi
Balderrama, Rafael & Hilario Molina. 2009. 'How Good Are Networks for Migrant Job Seekers? Ethnographic Evidence From North Carolina Farm Labor Camps.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:2 190-218.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	1	Migrant farmworker networks are vital components in their job seeking and underemployment minimization strategies. Yet, farmworker cultural, physical, and institutional isolation along with the itinerant and clandestine features of farmwork have become major obstacles in the development of robust lateral communitywide network ties that would otherwise favor reciprocity and resource sharing. Thus, contrary to the positive social capital assumption, we argue that the paucity and fragmented features of farmworkers' lateral ties have increased their vulnerability and locked them in exploitative relationships in a hostile social environment that makes impractical or impossible the formation of alternative ties. Our study is based on participant observation through a 6-week stay in three North Carolina farm labor camps. On-site evidence shows that the two larger groups of solitary male farmworkers and farmworking families break up into smaller groups, each group in pursuit of its own short-term goals. We conclude that, even though farmworker networks help them to find and ensure temporary jobs, their inability to use the networks to share resources is ultimately detrimental for participants' long-term socioeconomic prospects.	2	Rafael Balderrama; Hilario Molina
Mayer, Brian. 2009. 'Cross-movement Coalition Formation: Bridging the Labor-environment Divide.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:2 219-239.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	0	Relations between the labor and environmental movements exist within a complex web of clashing interests, electoral politics, and attempts to form enduring blue-green coalitions. Unions and other labor organizations are often portrayed as solely interested in economic growth. Environmental organizations are often seen as solely interested in preserving the natural world at the expense of economic growth, thus creating a direct conflict between the interests of labor and environmental organizations. Despite these perceived differences, efforts to bridge the divide between the two movements are increasingly common. This article examines the formation of a collective identity shared by workers and environmentalists participating in the coalition. I develop this argument through an ethnographic analysis of the formation of a blue-green coalition, the Alliance for a Healthy Tomorrow, using in-depth interviews, observations, and content analyses. I demonstrate how coalition leaders and bridge brokers work to bridge and consolidate the identities of labor and environmental groups to campaign for environmental health regulatory changes in Massachusetts.	1	Brian Mayer
Case, Charles & Cameron Lippard. 2009. 'Humorous Assaults on Patriarchal Ideology.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:2 240-255.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	2	Humor is a significant weapon in interpersonal and intergroup conflict and competition. Over the centuries, males have used humor and jokes to create and perpetuate patriarchal ideals, relationships, and structures. Today, feminists and other proponents of gender equality use humor to deconstruct patriarchal ideologies and sexist stereotypes. This exploratory study analyzes a collection of over 1,700 jokes identified as feminist and women's humor to discover what these jokes suggest with regard to the male-dominant structure in society and how these jokes are subversive in attempting to disrupt gender stereotypes and roles. We find that the humor of women and feminists seeks, in part, to discredit assumptions of males' superiority, masterfulness, sexual prowess, and extraordinary value to women and society. These jokes may, however, also work to reinforce stereotypes associated with men and women: ``If they could send a man to the moon, why not just send all of them?''.	2	Charles E. Case; Cameron D.

Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	3	The robustness of outcomes to the parameterization of behavioral rules is a crucial property of any model aimed at simulating complex human systems. Schelling model of residential segregation satisfies this criterion. Based on the recently available high-resolution census GIS, we apply Schelling model for investigating urban population patterns at the resolution of individual buildings and families. First, we simulate ethnic residential dynamics in Yaffo (an area of Tel Aviv), and demonstrate good quantitative correspondence for a 40-year period. Second, we investigate income-based residential patterns in nine Israeli cities, reveal their high heterogeneity, and explain the latter by the presence of low fraction of wealthier householders who are tolerant of their poorer neighbors and reside in their proximity. We extend Schelling model in this direction and demonstrate qualitative correspondence between the model's outcomes and the observed income-based residential patterns.	3	Itzhak Benenson; Erez Hatna; Ehud Or
O'Sullivan, David. 2009. 'Changing Neighborhoods-neighborhoods Changing a Framework for Spatially Explicit Agent-based Models of Social Systems.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 37:4 498-530.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	6	The nature of urban neighborhoods, neighborhood effects, and the dynamics of residential segregation are important themes in contemporary sociological inquiry. Agent-based models of social systems have been widely applied in this context. However, both applied and model-based research in these areas suffer from weaknesses in underlying conceptualizations and representations of spatial context. Drawing on human geography and the sociospatial perspective in urban sociology, a framework that enables richer and more realistic representation of urban neighborhoods in agent-based simulation models is proposed and outlined. The framework relies on a graph representation of the spatial relations among spatial locations and can accommodate well-defined administrative zones, vague or ill-defined neighborhoods, hierarchically nested spatial zoning systems, overlapping neighborhoods, and changing relations among neighborhoods. Results from a preliminary application of the framework demonstrate its utility and possibilities for research into the effects of neighborhood structure on social processes.	1	David O'Sullivan
Williams, Richard. 2009. 'Using Heterogeneous Choice Models to Compare Logit and Probit Coefficients Across Groups.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 37:4 531-559.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	45	Allison (1999) notes that comparisons of logit and probit coefficients across groups can be invalid and misleading, proposes a procedure by which these problems can be corrected, and argues that ``routine use [of this method] seems advisable'' and that ``it is hard to see how [the method] can be improved.'' In this article, the author argues that as originally proposed, Allison's method can have serious problems and should not be applied on a routine basis. However, this study also shows that his model belongs to a larger class of models variously known as heterogeneous choice or location-scale models. Several advantages of this broader and more flexible class of models are illustrated. Dependent variables can be ordinal in addition to binary, sources of heterogeneity can be better modeled and controlled for, and insights can be gained into the effects of group characteristics on outcomes that would be missed by other methods.	1	Richard Williams
Smith, Herman & Andreas Schneider. 2009. 'Critiquing Models of Emotions.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 37:4 560-589.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	3	This article provides the first systematic empirical examination of four major genres of theories concerning the nature and rise of the corpus of human emotions with more than 2,000 statistical tests of five hypotheses. The distinction between evolutionary-universal and other ``secondary'' emotions is empirically uninformative for all five cultures. Next, the emotion-wheel theory of Plutchik receives no empirical support. All palette theories fail four empirical tests. More than 90 empirical tests fail to support Kemper and Turner in assuming that many secondary emotions arise through complex combinations of primary emotions due to socialization. The Johnson-Laird and Oatley hypothesis of five universal clusters of emotions is also tested and rejected. Researchers need to rethink the heuristic value of dichotomizing and lumping emotions in categories such as universal, primary, basic, secondary, tertiary, and so forth. There are clear empirical advantages to differentiating between emotions with three dimensions rather than two dimensions.	2	Herman Smith; Andreas Schneider

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	6	The category of `rare diseases' has been in growing use in the fields of public health and patient advocacy for the past 15 years in Europe. In this socio-historical inquiry, I argue that this category, which appeared initially as a by-product of the orphan drug issue in the United States of America is a boundary object. As such, it has different specific local uses: a meaningless category for physicians, it relates to the patients' experience of illness, whereas the pharmaceutical industry first considered it as being synonymous with small markets and then with innovation. Public bodies contributed to framing a common and blurred use, based on a statistical definition whose purpose was to foster co-operation between the four groups involved in the issue. In the definition process of the category of rare diseases, the key actors were the patients and public bodies, not medical professionals or the pharmaceutical industry.	1	Caroline Huyard
Lundberg, Johanna, Margareta Kristenson & Bengt Starrin. 2009. 'Status Incongruence Revisited: Associations With Shame and Mental Wellbeing.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:4 478-493.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	6	Status incongruence has been related to poor health and all-cause mortality, and could be a growing public health problem due to changes in the labour market in later decades. Shaming experiences have been suggested as playing a part in the aetiology. The aim here was to study the risk for shaming experiences, pessimism, anxiety, depressive feelings, and poor mental wellbeing (as measured by the GHQ) with a special focus on shame, in four social status categories: negatively and positively incongruent individuals, and low-status and high-status congruent individuals. Data comprised 14,854 working men and women from a regional sample of randomly selected respondents, 18-79 years of age. Logistic regression was used to study differences in risk for negative emotional outcomes. Results showed that the negative incongruent category persisted as the group most at risk for all negative emotional outcomes (OR 1.5-1.9; p < 0.05-< 0.001). When testing the risk for poor mental wellbeing among the status categories with and without shaming experiences, ORs for all groups with shaming experiences were elevated. Among groups without shame, only the negative incongruent category remained at risk (OR 2.7; p < 0.05) after adjustment. Negative incongruent status is associated with adverse emotional outcomes, among them shame, which is a previously unappreciated aspect of status incongruence.	3	Johanna Lundberg; Margareta Kristenson; Bengt Starrin
Traynor, Michael. 2009. 'Indeterminacy and Technicality Revisited: How Medicine and Nursing Have Responded to the Evidence Based Movement.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:4 494-507.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	7	In 1970 sociologists Jamous and Peloille proposed that occupational work could be understood as a combination of technical activity and indeterminate judgement and that the professions were characterised by high levels of indeterminacy relative to technicality. They argued that groups with low status or on the fringes of powerful professional groups were more likely to promote technically based reform, whereas elites were likely to resist with assertions of indeterminacy. Subsequent writers claimed that their notion of the indeterminacy/technicality ratio was more useful in analysis of professional ideology than in examinations of work content. During the 1990s the evidence based movement exerted a strong influence within the healthcare professions. Medicine and nursing responded in ways that reflected their differing status; however, both reactions included assertions that evidence based practice (EBP) could not take into account the subtle expertise required in daily clinical decision making. This paper argues that Jamous and Peloille's theories about technical reform and professional elites can help to explain responses to EBP. EBP was initially promoted by a relatively low-status speciality of medicine while nursing, as an emerging profession, has shown more enthusiasm for its activities being formalised in a technically based fashion.	1	Michael Traynor

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	0	In this paper we will consider the question of mutation as it is manifested in press coverage of MRSA in UK hospitals. This represents a fertile field of discourse which brings into focus issues relating to microbes, people and working practices as well as the concepts of risk and vulnerability. A regular feature of reporting has been the presence of explanations for drug resistance involving repeated random mutations of the microbe to achieve progressively greater resistance and versatility, largely through a Darwinian process which is `clever' at overcoming human attempts at elimination. More recently a discourse has emerged which foregrounds also the vulnerability of patients who are very young, old or otherwise immunocompromised, or whose own genetic makeup might put them at risk from the microbe. The hospital is decentred as a source of infection, and attention is turned instead to nursing homes and gymnasia as sources of infection in the community. This latter development mitigates the responsibilities of hospitals and statutory healthcare providers and turns the risk back towards the individual as a responsible actor in an ecology of mutation.	2	Brian Brown; Paul Crawford
Stephenson, Niamh & Michelle Jamieson. 2009. 'Securitising Health: Australian Newspaper Coverage of Pandemic Influenza.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:4 525-539.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	11	This paper analyses contemporary Australian newspaper coverage of the threat of pandemic influenza in humans, specifically in the light of recent transformations in biomedical and public health understandings of infectious disease as continuously emerging. Our analysis suggests that the spectre of pandemic influenza is characterised, in newspaper accounts, as invoking a specific form of nation building. The Australian nation is depicted as successfully securing itself in the face of a threat from Asia (and in the absence of an effective international health body). What is described in newspaper accounts reflects a shift in the public health response to infectious disease. This response does not entail a direct focus on protecting either the population or national territory. Instead, it involves the continuous rehearsal of readiness to react to disasters through the networking of government and private agencies responsible for maintaining critical infrastructure. In this way, coverage of pandemic influenza positions health as central to national security, with little reporting of the reasons for or the potential implications of this alliance. Thus, the imperative to `be prepared' is presented as self-evident.	2	Niamh Stephenson; Michelle Jamieson

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	6	This study examines the construction of age identity among older people with chronic conditions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 45 participants from two senior centres. Applying symbolic interactionism and the concept of stigma to participants' narratives, we identified three categories of age identities: definitely old; definitely not old; and ambivalent about their age identity. Further, we examined the metaphors of agelessness and the mask of ageing, the relationship between chronological age and age identity as well as the age-related stereotypes that older people offered in their narratives of their experience of old age. Ideas about the meaning of old age itself varied, with some focusing on predominantly negative descriptors, while others saw it positively, i.e. as a time allowing for more freedom and self-exploration. The influence of chronic conditions on older adults' age identities is more complex and nuanced than the characterisations promoted by ageist stereotypes.	2	Philip A. Rozario; Daniel Derienzis

Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:4 554-568.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	9	Medical technological advances can have profound effects on people's lives by extending the life course and creating uncertain futures. This is the case for a number of persons with `diseases of childhood' who can now survive well into adulthood with technological support. This paper draws on a Canadian qualitative study of young men with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) which examined the effects of a shifting life expectancy on personal identities. Engaging with Pierre Bourdieu's central concept of habitus, we discuss the temporal dimensions of social exclusion and marginalised identities. Participants' narrative accounts revealed how their dispositions were orientated to a shortened lifespan that exerted damaging effects regardless of actual lifespan. Compounding their material, social and symbolic isolation was a temporal isolation whereby the men had lived every day anticipating that it could be their last for as much as a decade. The findings suggest a need to re-orient medical and social discourses to serve and include adults with DMD and other conditions previously limited to childhood in their communities.	3	Barbara E.

Kelly, Brian. 2009. 'Smoke-free Air Policy: Subcultural Shifts and Secondary Health Effects Among Club-going Young Adults.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:4 569-582.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	4	In March 2003, New York City implemented legislation that called for a ban of smoking in bars, restaurants, nightclubs, and other establishments. The express purpose of this legislation was to protect the health of employees and patrons from second-hand smoke. In addition to the stated goal of protection from second-hand smoke for employees, key secondary health effects of this law have emerged in the lives of club-going youth. This paper is based upon data derived from an ethnographic research project on club-related health issues in NYC. Drawing upon ethnographic fieldwork during the implementation of the ban and in-depth interviews with club-going youth, the paper provides a grounded analysis of youth reactions to the smoking ban and a descriptive profile of the secondary health effects of the smoking ban in nightclubs. It explores the attitudes of club-going youth towards the ban and the ways in which the legislation shapes the behaviours of habitual smokers, `social smoking', and the use of drugs within bars and clubs. In particular, the data suggest a tension between the desire to remain subculturally involved and the desire to smoke. It also highlights the adaptive character of subcultures and the importance of social relations in behavioural patterns.	1	Brian C. Kelly

Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:4 583-601.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	0	In many countries, cigarette consumption has been on a declining trend for over 20 years. However, different patterns of smoking practices have emerged. Our goal is to explore how the patterning of smoking practices occurs and persists over time, and to investigate the factors that could help interpret these patterns. Data were derived from the National Population Health Surveys and comprise a large representative sample of the population. Dynamic Typology methods reveal two main classes of typology: monothetic groups with stable patterns of behaviour over time (never-smokers, chronically addicted smokers, long-term ex-smokers); and polythetic groups with substantial behavioural variations. Moreover, socioeconomic inequalities are found among all groups, and gender-specific clusters of behaviour become apparent, with specific risk groups, such as the group of young women aged 20-24 at risk of becoming highly addicted. Our results also show that the effects of socioeconomic position on smoking practices are not significantly mediated by psychosocial variables such as self-esteem and personal control in both females and males. However, these variables still exert independent and differential effects on smoking practices in both genders. Our findings indicate that analysis of temporal patterns of smoking is crucial for tailoring type and timing of health-promoting interventions.	4	Marie-Rachelle Narcisse; Nicole Dedobbeleer; Andre-Pierre Contandriopoulos; Antonio Ciampi
Raz, Aviad. 2009. 'Eugenic Utopias/dystopias, Reprogenetics, and Community Genetics.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:4 602-616.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	4	The impetus for this review is the intriguing realisation that eugenics, viewed as dystopian and authoritarian in most of the 20(th) century, is in the process of being reinterpreted today - in the context of reproductive genetics - as utopian and liberal. This review offers an analytical framework for mapping the growing literature on this subject in order to provide a summary for both teaching and research in medical sociology. Recent works are subsumed and explored in three areas: historical criticism of the `old eugenics'; the continuation of this stream in the form of criticism of reprogenetics as a new, `backdoor' eugenic regime of bio-governmentality - an area which also includes the application of Foucauldian and feminist perspectives; and the recent enthusiasm regarding `liberal eugenics,' claiming that reprogenetic decisions should be left to individual consumers thus enhancing their options in the health market. The review concludes by discussing and illustrating potential research directions in this field, with a focus on the social and ethical aspects of `community genetics' and its emerging networks of individuals genetically at risk.	1	Aviad E.

Perrow, Charles. 2009. 'Modeling Firms in the Global Economy.' Theory and Society. 38:3 217-243.	Theory and Society	2009	6	I examine the apparent deverticalization of firms in the world economy and their adoption of relational contracting and modularization, necessitated by rapid product change, cheap and rapid transport, and new technologies. I argue that relational contracting is superseded by modularization when possible in the interest of more control over suppliers, and modularization in turn leads to consolidation, when possible, through buying up suppliers or making them captives. The result is increased concentration of economic power in the world economy, and examples of this are presented.	1	Charles Perrow
Beckert, Jens. 2009. 'the Social Order of Markets.' Theory and Society. 38:3 245-269.	Theory and Society	2009	34	In this article I develop a proposal for the theoretical vantage point of the sociology of markets, focusing on the problem of the social order of markets. The initial premise is that markets are highly demanding arenas of social interaction, which can only operate if three inevitable coordination problems are resolved. I define these coordination problems as the value problem, the problem of competition and the cooperation problem. I argue that these problems can only be resolved based on stable reciprocal expectations on the part of market actors, which have their basis in the socio-structural, institutional and cultural embedding of markets. The sociology of markets aims to investigate how market action is structured by these macrostructures and to examine their dynamic processes of change. While the focus of economic sociology has been primarily on the stability of markets and the reproduction of firms, the conceptualization developed here brings change and profit motives more forcefully into the analysis. It also differs from the focus of the new economic sociology on the supply side of markets, by emphasizing the role of demand for the order of markets, especially in the discussion of the problems of valuation and cooperation.	1	Jens Beckert
Chan, Cheris. 2009. 'Creating a Market in the Presence of Cultural Resistance: the Case of Life Insurance in China.' Theory and Society. 38:3 271-305.	Theory and Society	2009	7	This article brings together two different conceptions of culture-a shared meaning system on one hand and a repertoire of strategies on the other-to understand the emergence of a market. Based on ethnographic data, it examines how a Chinese life insurance market is emerging in the presence of incompatible shared values and ideas acting as cultural barriers, and how these cultural barriers shape the formation of the market. The findings reveal a burgeoning Chinese life insurance market despite local cultural logics incompatible with the profit-oriented institutional logic of life insurance. This Chinese market, however, has developed along a different trajectory from what might be expected. It first emerged as a money management, rather than a risk management, market. I argue that the very cultural barriers that compose the local resistance to a new economic practice also necessitate the mobilization of the cultural tool-kit to circumvent this resistance. These dual processes, shared ideas composing the resistance and the cultural tool-kit circumventing the resistance, shape the trajectory and characteristics of an emergent market. I propose a theoretical model specifying the mechanisms through which the two forms of culture interplay to influence the development of the life insurance. I apply this model to extend Zelizer's (1979) insights and discuss how culture matters in forging a new market in the global diffusion of capitalism.	1	Cheris Shun-ching Chan
Kidder, Jeffrey. 2009. 'Appropriating the City: Space, Theory, and Bike Messengers.' Theory and Society. 38:3 307-328.	Theory and Society	2009	5	Over the last 30 years, social theorists have increasingly emphasized the importance of space. However, in empirical research, the dialectical relationship between social interaction and the physical environment is still a largely neglected issue. Using the theory of structuration, I provide a concrete example of why and how space matters in the cultural analysis of an urban social world. I argue that bike messengers-individuals who deliver time-sensitive materials in downtown cores of major cities-cannot be understood outside an analysis of space. Specifically, I connect the cultural significance of messenger practices to the emplacement of those practices inside the urban environment.	1	Jeffrey L. Kidder
Burawoy, Michael. 2009. 'the Global Turn Lessons From Southern Labor Scholars and Their Labor Movements.' Work and Occupations. 36:2 87-95.	Work and Occupations	2009	3	For too long U. S. labor sociology has been reluctant to explore the world. By taking a global turn, we have much to learn from labor scholars and labor movements in the global South-much to learn about our own peculiarities, about the possibilities and obstacles to building links across national boundaries, and about the implications of ``globalization'' for both labor organizing and labor studies. In particular, the public turn taken by scholars in the global South toward their own labor movements holds lessons for a collaboration that is always fraught from both sides. These are just some of the issues raised by the essays in this issue that examine the history of labor sociologies and labor movements in Brazil, China, India, South Africa, and South Korea.	1	Michael Burawoy

Work and Occupations	2009	0	In this article, the authors analyze the relationship between labor sociology and trade unionism in Brazil by focusing on its three key phases. Against the backdrop of successive political and economical scenarios, the authors go from the first generation of labor sociologists to the most recent period, trying to identify the transition points in this trajectory. This study develops the hypothesis that labor sociology in Brazil was first characterized by a search for affirmation and professionalization (1950-1960). Later, it developed a strong political-social engagement, and assumed a public character, by claiming particular social identities (1970-1980). Finally, it flowed toward policy sociology (1990-2000).	2	Marco Aurelio Santana; Ruy Braga

Work and Occupations	2009	2	This article examines the predicament and possibility for the development of a public sociology of labor in China. Labor studies that take seriously workers' class experience and capacity have been stymied by a Communist regime keen on censoring and domesticating sociology as a profession as well as fragmenting the interests, identities, and mobilization of the working class. Yet, in recent years, persistent struggles by Chinese workers themselves have created intense pressure on the Chinese state to redefine its position toward labor conflicts. at the same time, global labor and academic communities have infused ideas and resources that help expand the scope and linkages of labor civic activism.	2	Ching Kwan Lee; Yuan Shen
Bhowmik, Sharit. 2009. 'India Labor Sociology Searching for a Direction.' Work and Occupations. 36:2 126-144.	Work and Occupations	2009	1	This article explores the history of the labor movement in India and the parallel development of labor sociology. It assesses the influence of Western models of labor, stressing their weaknesses in diagnosing the peculiarity of the Indian situation. Because of these models, and also because of the narrow concerns of trade unions, until recently labor studies overlooked the overwhelming proportion of the work force-namely, the informal workers. Despite all the hype about business process outsourcing companies and call centers, it is this sector of the labor force that has increased most rapidly during the past 15 years since the beginning of market liberalization. although sociological studies are catching up with the transformation of the labor force, there still remain very few contacts between scholars and labor unions or labor activists.	1	Sharit K.

Buhlungu, Sakhela. 2009. 'South Africa the Decline of Labor Studies and the Democratic Transition.' Work and Occupations. 36:2 145-161.	Work and Occupations	2009	1	This article explores the ways in which a form of intellectual engagement has gone beyond merely studying society and sought to influence processes of change by engaging with actors outside disciplinary scholarship and the academy. In South Africa, the broad subdiscipline of labor studies provides probably the best illustration of this engagement, which Burawoy has termed public sociology. The article traces the emergence and growth of public sociology, initially from the position of relative privilege in the ivory tower and later to more direct forms of engagement with the new publics that emerged in the antiapartheid struggle. The discussion explains why the labor movement became the focal point of public sociology in South Africa. Finally, the article argues that the advent of democracy led to a growing assertiveness among the antiapartheid movements, including labor. Not only did this alter the terms on which public sociology was undertaken, it also resulted in a decline of public sociology inherited from the antiapartheid struggle.	1	Sakhela Buhlungu
Cho, Soon-Kyoung. 2009. 'South Korea Toward a Collective Public Sociology of Labor.' Work and Occupations. 36:2 162-176.	Work and Occupations	2009	0	Third-wave marketization in South Korea has changed the social structure of academic knowledge production, revealing the dilemmas and limitations of both traditional and organic public sociology. The emergence of collective intellectuals during the candlelight movement points to an alternative relationship between the researcher and the researched. The candlelight vigils that recently rocked Korean society have pointed to new possibilities for a public sociology of labor. This article discusses the conditions for public labor sociology as a new paradigm based on collective knowledge and argues that when facing increasing professionalization of public sociology, the ``crisis of labor'' calls for a collective public sociology.	1	Soon-Kyoung Cho
Tavory, Iddo & Ann Swidler. 2009. 'Condom Semiotics: Meaning and Condom Use in Rural Malawi.' American Sociological Review. 74:2 171-189.	American Sociological Review	2009	29	This article examines the widespread resistance to condom use in sub-Saharan Africa by describing the major semiotic axes that organize how people talk about condoms and condom use. These axes include the ``sweetness'' of sex, trust and love between sexual partners, and assessments of risk and danger Using data from rural Malawi, we show that framing the meaning of condoms as a simple choice between risky behavior and rational attempts to protect one health ignores the complex semiotic space that Malawians navigate. Based on data from more than 600 diaries that record rural Malawians' everyday conversations, our analysis charts the semiotic axes related to condom use. Semiotic constraints operate most powerfully at the level of relationships. Condom use signifies a risk-v, less serious, and less intimate partner Even when people believe that condom use is appropriate, wise, or even a matter of life and death, the statement that condom use makes about a relationship usually trumps all other meanings. We call for a more nuanced analysis of culture, one that is attentive to the ways agents navigate multiple, contested meanings, and that demonstrates how specific semiotic axes are brought to bear in particular interactional contexts.	2	Iddo Tavory; Ann Swidler
Martin, Karin. 2009. 'Normalizing Heterosexuality: Mothers' Assumptions, Talk, and Strategies With Young Children.' American Sociological Review. 74:2 190-207.	American Sociological Review	2009	11	In recent years, social scientists have identified not just heterosexism and homophobia as social problems, but also heteronormativity-the mundane, everyday ways that heterosexuality is privileged and taken for granted as normal and natural. There is little empirical research, however on how heterosexuality is reproduced and then normalized for individuals. Using survey data from more than 600 mothers of young children, ages 3 to 6 years old, this article examines how mothers normalize heterosexuality for young children. The data suggest that most mothers, who are parenting in a gendered and heteronormative context to begin with, assume that their children are heterosexual, describe romantic and adult relationships to children as only heterosexual, and make gays and lesbians invisible to their children. Those who consider that their children could some day be gay tend to adopt one of three strategies in response: Most pursue a passive strategy of ``crossing their fingers'' and hoping otherwise. A very few try to prepare their children for the possibility of being gay. A larger group, primarily mothers from conservative Protestant religions, work to prevent homosexuality. I conclude by discussing the implications of these findings for understanding sexual identity development and the construction of heteronormativity.	1	Karin A. Martin
Herring, Cedric. 2009. 'Does Diversity Pay?: Race, Gender, and the Business Case for Diversity.' American Sociological Review. 74:2 208-224.	American Sociological Review	2009	40	The value-in-diversity perspective argues that a diverse workforce, relative to a homogeneous one, is generally beneficial for business, including but not limited to corporate profits and earnings. This is in contrast to other accounts that view diversity as either nonconsequential to business success or actually detrimental by creating conflict, undermining cohesion, and thus decreasing productivity. Using data from the 1996 to 1997 National Organizations Survey, a national sample of for-profit business organizations, this article tests eight hypotheses derived from the value-in-diversity thesis. The results support seven of these hypotheses: racial diversity is associated with increased sales revenue, more customers, greater market share, and greater relative profits. Gender diversity is associated with increased sales revenue, more customers, and greater relative profits. I discuss the implications of these findings relative to alternative views of diversity in the workplace.	1	Cedric Herring
Skaggs, Sheryl. 2009. 'Legal-political Pressures and African American Access to Managerial Jobs.' American Sociological Review. 74:2 225-244.	American Sociological Review	2009	6	Prior work on equal employment opportunity tends to focus on a limited set of factors that influence change in organizational structures and policies. This article considers a broader set of potentially influential legal and political coercive pressures-namely, discrimination lawsuits, federal court dynamics, and state political ideology-and analyzes their implications for concrete changes in organizational behavior Using national establishment-level data on the supermarket industry from 1983 to 1998, 1 estimate African American managerial representation using a series of auto-distributed lag (ADL) models with fixed-effects. The results show that in the year following a lawsuit filing against a particular supermarket establishment, African Americans are more likely to enter management. Furthermore, over the long run, coercive isomorphism (whereby establishments subject to a lawsuit come to adopt industry averages for African American managerial representation) seems to prevail. Finally, legal pressures associated with federal court judges `gender and racial/ethnic diversity and state-level government ideology are also influential. I conclude by discussing these results and the importance of systematically incorporating political process into sociological theorizing and analyses of workplace diversity	1	Sheryl Skaggs
Hirsh, C.. 2009. 'the Strength of Weak Enforcement: the Impact of Discrimination Charges, Legal Environments, and Organizational Conditions on Workplace Segregation.' American Sociological Review. 74:2 245-271.	American Sociological Review	2009	10	Much research examines the organizational changes brought by equal employment opportunity (EEO) law, but it remains unclear whether establishments formally charged with employment discrimination and found in violation of EEO laws actually improve workplace conditions for women and racial minorities. Building on economic and institutional accounts of organizational responses to legal intervention, this article assesses the effects of discrimination charges and their resolutions on changes in establishment-level occupational segregation by sex and race from 1990 to 2002. Using data from a national random sample of work establishments matched to discrimination charge data, I examine the direct impact of charges on workplaces, as well as the indirect pressures that establishments experience in their legal and organizational environments. For sex segregation, I find that establishments do not desegregate in the wake of discrimination charges filed directly against them, but they do respond to EEO enforcement in their industrial fields and legal environments. For race segregation, organizational factors-rather than legal intervention-are the primary predictors of desegregation. To the extent that EEO enforcement encourages organizational change, it does so indirectly operating through establishments' industrial and legal environments.	1	C. Elizabeth Hirsh
Frank, David, Tara Hardinge & Kassia Wosick-Correa. 2009. 'the Global Dimensions of Rape-law Reform: a Cross-national Study of Policy Outcomes.' American Sociological Review. 74:2 272-290.	American Sociological Review	2009	13	Most studies of rape-law reform outcomes focus on single cases. We advance this literature by studying outcomes more systematically-leveraging new cross-national and longitudinal reform data-and showing that reform outcomes have both global and national determinants. Our exploratory analyses show three main findings: (1) Rape-law reforms are strongly associated with elevated police reporting between 1945 and 2005. (2) The strength of the association depends on domestic contexts. The association is stronger in countries characterized by individualism, women mobilization, wealth, and education; it is weaker in countries with greater democracy and police strength. (3) The strength of the association also depends on global contexts. It is stronger in countries with dense linkages to world society and weaker under conditions of global institutionalization, as widespread diffusion gives rise to both ceremony without substance (i.e., domestic rape-law reforms without subsequent increases in reporting) and substance without ceremony (increased police reporting without antecedent reforms). In multivariate regression analyses, rape-law reforms, women mobilization, and links, to world society all have positive and significant effects on police reporting. It appears that both global and domestic contexts-together and independently-importantly shape policy and practice.	3	David John Frank; Tara Hardinge; Kassia Wosick-Correa
King, Ryan, Steven Messner & Robert Baller. 2009. 'Contemporary Hate Crimes, Law Enforcement, and the Legacy of Racial Violence.' American Sociological Review. 74:2 291-315.	American Sociological Review	2009	7	This article investigates the association between past lynchings (1882 to 193 0) and contemporary law enforcement responses to hate crimes in the United States. While prior research indicates a positive correlation between past levels of lynching and current social control practices against minority groups, we posit an inverse relationship for facets of social control that are protective of minorities. Specifically, we hypothesize that contemporary hate crime policing and prosecution will be less vigorous where lynching was more prevalent prior to 1930. Analyses show that levels of past lynching are associated with three outcome variables germane to hate crime policing and prosecution, but the effect of lynching is partly contingent on the presence of a minority group threat. That is, past lynching combined with a sizeable black population largely suppresses (1) police compliance with federal hate crime law, (2) police reports of hate crimes that target blacks, and in some analyses (3) the likelihood of prosecuting a hate crime case. Our findings have implications for research on law and intergroup conflict, historical continuity in the exercise of state social control, and theories that emphasize minority group threat.	3	Ryan D.

Wimmer, Andreas, Lars-Erik Cederman & Brian Min. 2009. 'Ethnic Politics and Armed Conflict: a Configurational Analysis of a New Global Data Set.' American Sociological Review. 74:2 316-337.	American Sociological Review	2009	52	Quantitative scholarship on civil wars has long debated whether ethnic diversity breeds armed conflict. We go beyond this debate and show that highly diverse societies are not more conflict prone. Rather states characterized by certain ethnopolitical configurations of power are more likely to experience violent conflict. First, armed rebellions are more likely to challenge states that exclude large portions of the population on the basis of ethnic background. Second, when a large number of competing elites share power in a segmented state, the risk of violent infighting increases. Third, incohesive states with a short history of direct rule are more likely to experience secessionist conflicts. We test these hypotheses for all independent states since 1945 using the new Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) data set. Cross-national analysis demonstrates that ethnic politics is as powerful and robust in predicting civil wars as is a country level of economic development. Using multinomial logit regression, we show that rebellion, infighting, and secession result from high degrees of exclusion, segmentation, and incohesion, respectively. More diverse states, on the other hand, are not more likely to suffer from violent conflict.	3	Andreas Wimmer; Lars-Erik Cederman; Brian Min
Ridgeway, Cecilia. 2009. 'Framed Before We Know It How Gender Shapes Social Relations.' Gender \& Society. 23:2 145-160.	Gender \& Society	2009	50	In this article, I argue that gender is a primary cultural frame for coordinating behavior and organizing social relations. I describe the implications for understanding how gender shapes social behavior and organizational structures. By my analysis, gender typically acts as a background identity that biases, in gendered directions, the performance of behaviors undertaken in the name of organizational roles and identities. I develop an account of how the background effects of the gender frame on behavior vary by the context that different organizational and institutional structures set but can also infuse gendered meanings into organizational practices. Next, I apply this account to two empirical illustrations to demonstrate that we cannot understand the shape that the structure of gender inequality and gender difference takes in particular institutional or societal contexts without taking into account the background effects of the gender frame on behavior in these contexts.	1	Cecilia L.

Shows, Carla & Naomi Gerstel. 2009. 'Fathering, Class, and Gender a Comparison of Physicians and Emergency Medical Technicians.' Gender \& Society. 23:2 161-187.	Gender \& Society	2009	24	Using a multimethod approach (including a survey, interviews, and observations), this article examines the link between class and masculinities by comparing the way two groups-professional men (physicians) and working-class men (emergency medical technicians, or EMTs)-practice fatherhood. First, the authors show that these two groups practice different types of masculinity as they engage in different kinds of fatherhood. Physicians emphasize ``public fatherhood,'' which entails attendance at public events but little involvement in the daily care of their children. In contrast, EMTs are not only involved in their children's public events but also emphasize `` private fatherhood,'' which entails involvement in their daily care. Second, the authors suggest that these differing types of involvement can be explained by the contrasting employment conditions of each group as well the gender order of their families, especially the divergent labor market positions of spouses and the division of parenting. The authors conclude by arguing that these working-class fathers are `` undoing gender'' while professional fathers reproduce the conventional gender order.	2	Carla Shows; Naomi Gerstel
Van, Patricia, Arie Glebbeek, Suzan Lewis & Siegwart Lindenberg. 2009. 'Post-fordist Work: a Man's World? Gender and Working Overtime in the Netherlands.' Gender \& Society. 23:2 188-214.	Gender \& Society	2009	5	There is debate about whether the post-Fordist or high-performance work organization can overcome the disadvantages women encounter in traditional gendered organizations. Some authors argue that substituting a performance logic for control by the clock offers opportunities for combining work and family life in a more natural way. Critics respond that these organizational reforms do not address the nonresponsibility of firms for caring duties at a more fundamental level. The authors address this debate through an analysis of overtime work, using data from a survey of 1,114 employees in 30 Dutch organizations. The findings reveal that post-Fordist work is associated with more overtime hours than traditional forms of work and that far from challenging gendered organization, it reproduces and exacerbates the traditional male model of work.	4	Patricia Van; Arie Glebbeek; Suzan Lewis; Siegwart Lindenberg
Cha, Youngjoo & Sarah Thebaud. 2009. 'Labor Markets, Breadwinning, and Beliefs How Economic Context Shapes Men's Gender Ideology.' Gender \& Society. 23:2 215-243.	Gender \& Society	2009	8	Abundant research has found that men's economic status shapes their gender ideology such that men who are breadwinners are less likely to endorse egalitarian ideology than men in nontraditional arrangements. This article investigates how the association between men's breadwinning status and gender ideology is influenced by the institutional arrangements of different types of labor markets. Rigid labor markets support men's ability to be breadwinners in the long term, whereas flexible labor markets provide men with more frequent, but less permanent, experiences of nontraditional arrangements. The authors anticipate that breadwinner status will have stronger effects on men's gender ideology in rigid labor markets because men can expect less fluctuation in their employment situations in those contexts. Results from a multilevel analysis of 27 countries indeed demonstrate that individual men's economic dependency on their partners influences men's gender egalitarian ideology more strongly in rigid labor markets than in flexible markets.	2	Youngjoo Cha; Sarah Thebaud

Gender \& Society	2009	3	During the Philippine-American War (1899-1902), the Anti-Imperialist League was the organizational vanguard of an anti-imperialist movement. Research on this period of U. S. imperialism has focused on empire building, ignoring the gendered activity of anti-imperialists in the metropole. The author outlines the constitutive relationship between gendered structures and experience that informed anti-imperialists' ``contentious politics,'' using archival sources of the Anti-Imperialist League and anti-imperialist debates in newspapers. The author shows how anti- imperialist leaders informally included women's monetary donations, labor, networks, and reputations while formally excluding their full membership. Finally, the author shows how masculinist ambivalence, or the pattern of the gendered inclusions/exclusions of anti- imperialists, explains the incremental transformations and reproductions of gendered structures in anti- imperialists' contentious politics. The author suggests masculinist ambivalence has theoretical utility for explaining gendered inclusions and exclusions in movements that are not explicitly about gender conflict or change.	1	Erin L.

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	3	This article explores the gang suppression model and how it becomes practiced in the profiling and interactions between police and inner-city Mexican Americans. I conducted this research formally over five years in two southwestern cities-Denver, Colorado, and Ogden, Utah-and informally for fourteen years by the researcher's experience as an ex-gang member. I suggest that stereotyping Mexican American communities as gang ``infested'' and equating gangs as synonymous with crime allows for differential policing that no longer emphasizes criminal acts, but rather perpetual criminal people. Gang enforcement is over-inclusive and embedded with practices that create opportunities for abuse of authority.	1	Robert J. Duran

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 38:2 169-200.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	0	This article demonstrates how boardwalk artists who arrive at Venice Beach through various biographical channels adapt to an informal market context by learning economic skills that enable them to present themselves as ``Venice Beach Artists.'' Although the boardwalk market blurs original biographical distinctions between people who come to share the same market identity in the eyes of visitors, individuals also pursue different versions of authentic identity as Venice Beach Artists. Interlinking studies of outsider art, public interaction, and identity transition, I examine how artists forge distinct paths towards the achievement of authentic identity. Some artists create standards of local authenticity by prioritizing their attachment to the context of Venice Beach and immersing themselves into the neighborhood counter culture. Others manufacture cosmopolitan authenticity by prioritizing their attachment to their perceptions of a successful art career.	1	Andrew Deener
Martinez, Damian & Johnna Christian. 2009. 'the Familial Relationships of Former Prisoners Examining the Link Between Residence and Informal Support Mechanisms.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 38:2 201-224.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	6	Former prisoners face tremendous challenges on release from prison-particularly in their reintegration into family relationships. The research evidence indicates that family support is essential to avoid reincarceration. Little is known, however, about what occurs in these relationships, specifically how support is exchanged, why it facilitates success, and which types of support are meaningful. This article examines how former prisoners and their family members exchange supports within two contexts-residence with a family member and residence in a halfway house-and how those supports affect the family relationship. Data were gathered through in-depth interviews with six dyads of former prisoners and family members. The findings indicate that former prisoners' and family members' perceptions and actual exchanges of informal support differ according to the former prisoner's residence, suggesting that residential context is an important aspect in identifying support mechanisms and facilitating former prisoners' resettlement into, and renegotiation of, family relationships.	2	Damian J.

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	5	Drawing from interviews and fieldwork with Red Hat Society members (RHS), we consider the growing consumer culture of the RHS, how members conspicuously consume red and purple dress, and for what purposes they do so. RHS members in this study develop visible group identity, reinforce traditional gendered behavior, and challenge publicly what it means to be ``old.'' We investigate consumption as a means of discerning whether midlife women's participation in RHS is a commodity to be marketed, bought, and sold. Is the public space that RHS women take up collectively challenging the ageist ways in which society views aging women? We investigate the consumer culture of the RHS to determine possible links between conspicuous consumption and group identity within the cultural context of aging women's social invisibility.	4	Marybeth C.

Weiner, Kate. 2009. 'Lay Involvement and Legitimacy the Construction of Expertise and Participation Within Heart Uk.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 38:2 254-273.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	5	In 2002, the Family Heart Association (FHA), a U. K. patient-focused charity working in the area of inherited high cholesterol conditions, merged with the professional organization in this field to form HEART UK. This article explores how this merger might be understood in the context of current scholarly interest in patient organizations that has focused on the emergence of novel forms of lay-expert relations and knowledge production. The article argues that the merger does not signal radical shifts concerning the relationship between credentialed biomedical experts and lay people. Instead, the merger can be understood as a strategic move concerned with reinforcing legitimacy with policy makers and potential funders. In view of the range of claims being made in relation to lay health groups, this study suggests that one must remain attentive to the circumstances under which novel lay-expert collaborations emerge.	1	Kate Weiner
Kuipers, Giselinde & Jeroen Kloet. 2009. 'Banal Cosmopolitanism and the Lord of the Rings: the Limited Role of National Differences in Global Media Consumption.' Poetics. 37:2 99-118.	Poetics	2009	5	Comparative reception studies are generally built around the expectation to find national cultural differences. Using data from a comparative study on The Lord of the Rings, Return of the King, this paper investigates the role of nationality in the reception of global media texts. Analysis of differences in appreciation, interpretation and involvement in an online survey (N = 24,747) showed great variation in audience reception, especially in interpretation, but no cultural or national patterns. Cluster analysis of response patterns yielded two clusters. The first cluster had greater levels of involvement and appreciation, strong allegiance to the preferred reading, and higher prevalence in the Anglophone world; the second contained more diverse interpretations by respondents further from the global ``center'' both geographically and demographically (gender, age). The paper argues that for global media texts like LotR, national ``repertoires of evaluation'' are superseded by global or transnational repertoires, which are more readily available to viewers closer to the cultural and geographic center. This calls into question the use of the nation-state as the fundamental unit of analysis for comparative research. Globalized, market-driven cultural expressions produce patterns of reception characterized by what Beck described as ``banal cosmopolitanism'': the experience of ``globality'' embedded in everyday life.	2	Giselinde Kuipers; Jeroen Kloet
Warde, Alan & Modesto Gayo-Cal. 2009. 'the Anatomy of Cultural Omnivorousness: the Case of the United Kingdom.' Poetics. 37:2 119-145.	Poetics	2009	12	The cultural omnivore debate is central to the understanding of contemporary cultural inequality. This paper offers some new evidence about Britain, some methodological clarification regarding the consequences of using different measures of omnivorousness and some considerations about its role in cultural reproduction. High quality data from a survey of the UK in 2003-2004 provide relevant evidence about participation and taste across several cultural domains. We identify omnivorousness in terms of both volume and composition of preferences. Socio-demographic factors affecting omnivore volume are broadly similar, but not identical, to those reported for other countries. Concerning the composition of preferences, and conscious of the controversies about the dissolution of cultural hierarchy, we apply a new procedure for a tripartite classification of tastes and practices as legitimate, common and unauthorised. Bundles of preferences are examined. We conclude that there is a section of the population whose preferences span the categories of the legitimate, the common and the unauthorised, but that the most omnivorous portion of the population, and also the highest social class, disproportionately embrace legitimate items, suggesting that an omnivorous orientation is a mark of cultural capital.

Elchardus, Mark. 2009. 'Self-control as Social Control the Emergence of Symbolic Society.' Poetics. 37:2 146-161.	Poetics	2009	7	Accepting Ulrich Beck's and Anthony Giddens' diagnosis of contemporary society, many sociologists have equated post-tradition with reflexive modernization and with a social order characterized by a strong degree of individualization. This article reviews relevant empirical evidence concerning that individualization thesis, and concludes that it should be rejected. It proposes to view post-tradition, not as the harbinger of increased reflexivity and individualization, but as a shift in the mode of social control. Scarcity, religious belief and ideology, traditional ethics and roles, sensitivity to command and respect for authority, have lost much, if not all of their steering and controlling capacity. This does however not herald an epoch of individual autonomy, but a new form of social control, centered around the self, and in which schooling, the mass-media, the world of goods and therapy play an important role.	1	Mark Elchardus
Watkins, Susan & Ann Swidler. 2009. 'Hearsay Ethnography: Conversational Journals as a Method for Studying Culture in Action.' Poetics. 37:2 162-184.	Poetics	2009	13	Social scientists have long struggled to develop methods adequate to their theoretical understanding of meaning as collective and dynamic. While culture is widely understood as an emergent property of collectivities, the methods we use keep pulling us back towards interview-situated accounts and an image of culture as located in individual experience. Scholars who seek to access supra-individual semiotic structures by studying public rituals and other collectively produced texts then have difficulty capturing the dynamic processes through which such meanings are created and changed in situ. To try to capture more effectively the way meaning is produced and re-produced in everyday life, we focus here on conversational interactions-the voices and actions that constitute the relational space among actors. Conversational journals provide us with a method: the analysis of texts produced by cultural insiders who keep journals of who-said-what-to-whom in conversations they overhear or events they participate in during the course of their daily lives. We describe the method, distinguishing it from other approaches and noting its drawbacks. We then illustrate the methodological advantages of conversational journals with examples from our texts. We end with a discussion of the method's potential in our setting as well as in other places and times.	2	Susan Cotts Watkins; Ann Swidler
Alba, Richard & Tariqul Islam. 2009. 'the Case of the Disappearing Mexican Americans: an Ethnic-identity Mystery.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:2 109-121.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	10	We examine the issue of identification stability for U.S.-born Mexican Americans, by far the largest of the ethnic groups growing as a result of contemporary immigration. We demonstrate a significant exodus from the group as identified by the census. Although changes in the wording of the census question may have contributed to this loss, a major portion, as revealed by comparisons of birth cohorts across the 1980, 1990, and 2000 Censuses, occurs because individuals who identified themselves as Mexican American at an earlier point in time do not do so at a later point. In addition, there are exits that occur between generations because of past intermarriage, evident in the number of non-Hispanics who claim Mexican ancestry. The losses appear to be accounted for by two kinds of identity shifts: toward identities that have a mainstream character and thus appear reflect conventional assimilation; and toward identities that have a pan-ethnic character, i.e., with Hispanics or Latinos. These exits are selective, but in complex and partially off-setting ways. Nevertheless, the comparison of the characteristics of U.S.-born members of the Mexican-American group over time is likely to be affected by changing patterns of identification.	2	Richard Alba; Tariqul Islam
Hamilton, Erin, Andres Villarreal & Robert Hummer. 2009. 'Mother's, Household, and Community Us Migration Experience and Infant Mortality in Rural and Urban Mexico.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:2 123-142.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	1	This study explores rural and urban differences in the relationship between U.S. migration experience measured at the individual, household, and community levels and individual-level infant mortality outcomes in a national sample of recent births in Mexico. Using 2000 Mexican Census data and multi-level regression models, we find that women's own U.S. migration experience is associated with lower odds of infant mortality in both rural and urban Mexico, possibly reflecting a process of healthy migrant selectivity. Household migration has mixed blessings for infant health in rural places: remittances are beneficial for infant survival, but recent out-migration is disruptive. Recent community-level migration experience is not significantly associated with infant mortality overall, although in rural places, there is some evidence that higher levels of community migration are associated with lower infant mortality. Household- and community-level migration have no relationship with infant mortality in urban places. Thus, international migration is associated with infant outcomes in Mexico in fairly complex ways, and the relationships are expressed most profoundly in rural areas of Mexico.	3	Erin R.

Population Research and Policy Review	2009	1	This paper examines how individual characteristics and structural factors have changed in determining Jewish internal migration in the U.S. between 1985-1990 and 1995-2000. Multinomial logistic regression analysis of the 1990 and 2000 National Jewish Population Surveys shows that socio-demographic characteristics have both increased their power to explain variation in 5-year migration and have become more similar for intra- and interstate migration. Further analysis added migration status at the beginning-of-period, state context of residence characteristics, and ethnic concentration to the explanatory variables. Results from logistic regression analysis, which was limited to interstate mobility, were very much in accordance with the observations of the single-level analysis of the socio-demographic variables. Additional findings suggest that previous mobility increases subsequent interstate migration; that per capita income does not have a meaningful effect on migration; that unemployment encourages migration (yet later this relationship turned negative); and that warm climate deters migration. The importance of ethnic concentration has weakened over time albeit maintained statistically significant. Finally, when the two surveys were integrated into one data set, ``time'' enhances the tendency of Jews to migrate. The results are discussed in the context of ethnic diversity in contemporary America.	2	Uzi Rebhun; Sidney Goldstein
Saarela, Jan & Fjalar Finnas. 2009. 'Geographic Ancestry and Cause-specific Mortality in a National Population.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:2 169-194.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	6	There are marked differentials in mortality risks across regions in Finland. No exhaustive explanation to this variation has been provided, however. The aim of this paper is to analyse how geographic ancestry, as proxied by persons' birth region and population group, interrelates with cause-specific mortality risks. Focusing on people aged between their mid-thirties and late-forties, we use longitudinal population register data that offer opportunities to account for variables that represent both persons' social background and their own social status at young adult age. Results of Cox proportional hazard models say that these variables have substantial effects on mortality of different causes, but only a marginal impact on the variation in death rates by birth region and population group. The geographic mortality pattern is found to be specifically prominent for causes of death that are fairly unrelated to persons' lifestyles. Our findings suggest that genetic predisposal as expressed in terms of geographic ancestry might play a relevant role in understanding mortality variation within the population of Finland.	2	Jan Saarela; Fjalar Finnas
Timberlake, Jeffrey. 2009. '``scratchin' and Surviving'' or ``movin' on Up?'' Two Sources of Change in Children's Neighborhood Ses.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:2 195-219.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	0	This research investigates the extent to which racial and ethnic inequality in children's neighborhood socioeconomic status (SES) is exacerbated or attenuated via two mechanisms: changing neighborhood characteristics for residentially nonmobile children, and differences in the SES of destination versus origin neighborhoods for residentially mobile children. I use longitudinal data to estimate year-to-year change via these two mechanisms in four measures of neighborhood SES for white, black, and Latino children. I find that nonmobile white children experience greater improvement in neighborhood SES than statistically comparable black and Latino children. However, I find lower levels of inequality in neighborhood SES returns to residential mobility; in fact, in many cases those returns are greater for minority children than for white children. These findings suggest that continued inequality in children's neighborhood contexts is not due primarily to inequality in outcomes of residential moves, but rather to the greater tendency of white children to reside in neighborhoods with higher levels of SES, and the greater likelihood of those neighborhoods to maintain or improve their levels of SES over time.	1	Jeffrey M.

Eberly, Todd, Mary Pohl & Stacey Davis. 2009. 'Undercounting Medicaid Enrollment in Maryland: Testing the Accuracy of the Current Population Survey.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:2 221-236.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	2	The U.S. Census Bureau's Current Population Survey is the most commonly cited source for estimates of the insurance status of Americans, but there are concerns that the data may undercount participation in public programs such as Medicaid. Such a Medicaid undercount may result from survey respondents not acknowledging Medicaid coverage because they are unaware that they are enrolled in Medicaid, because they have not recently received health services, due to the stigma associated with receiving public assistance programs, or due to simple recall bias. This paper estimates the extent to which the Current Population Survey undercounts Medicaid participation in a single mid-Atlantic state, Maryland. We administered the Current Population Survey questionnaire to a random selection of known Medicaid participants. We find evidence that the Current Population Survey significantly undercounts Medicaid participation in Maryland and that much of the undercount could be corrected if the survey better identified the Maryland Medicaid program. We also find that recall bias may contribute to the undercount as well. There was no indication that stigma contributed to any undercount. Though not an aim of this study, we find that the Medicaid undercount may contribute to an over count of the number of uninsured.	3	Todd Eberly; Mary Beth Pohl; Stacey Davis

Population Research and Policy Review	2009	4	American women have increasingly opted for tubal sterilization or tubal ligation surgery in recent decades. While research has begun to examine the unequal access to health care in the United States, little research has considered how this may impact whether women opt for a tubal ligation surgery. We first profile women with and without tubal ligations using bivariate analysis of the most recent data available, a nationally representative sample of 7,643 women from the National Survey of Family Growth, Cycle 6 (NSFG, Public use data file, 2002). We then use logistic regression models to examine the relationship between having tubal ligation and two focal variables: (1) type of health insurance (Medicaid compared with private, government or military, and no health insurance), and (2) rural or urban place of residence. We find that women on Medicaid are nearly twice as likely to have had a tubal sterilization compared with women who have private health insurance coverage. Also, women on Medicaid are substantially more likely to have a tubal sterilization than women with government or military insurance and women with no health insurance (26\% and 36\%, respectively). Further, we find that women living in rural areas are nearly twice as likely to have a tubal sterilization, compared with women in urban or suburban areas, all else being equal.	2	Loretta E. Bass; M.

Goldrick-Rab, Sara & Fabian Pfeffer. 2009. 'Beyond Access: Explaining Socioeconomic Differences in College Transfer.' Sociology of Education. 82:2 101-125.	Sociology of Education	2009	11	Reducing socioeconomic differences in college transfer requires understanding how and why parental education, occupational class, and family income are associated with changing colleges. Building on prior studies of traditional community college transfer, the authors explore relationships between those factors and two types of transfer among four-year college students. The results indicate that reverse transfer-the move from a four-year to a community college-is more common among students from less-educated families partly because of lower levels of academic performance during their freshman year. In contrast, students from advantaged backgrounds in terms of class and income are more likely than are others to engage in a lateral transfer-from a four-year to a four-year college-which may reflect individual preferences for changing colleges, rather than a reaction to poor academic performance. Implications for policy and practice are discussed in light of the fact that only reverse transfer is associated with lower rates of completion of bachelor's degrees.	2	Sara Goldrick-Rab; Fabian T.

Turley, Ruth. 2009. 'College Proximity: Mapping Access to Opportunity.' Sociology of Education. 82:2 126-146.	Sociology of Education	2009	13	The process by which students decide whether and where to attend college has been based most commonly on a college-choice model that is independent of the students' geographic context. However, the ability to attend college close to home is often among the most important factors that U.S. high school students, especially minorities and the socioeconomically disadvantaged, consider. The study presented here mapped the place of residence of a national sample of high school seniors, as well as the location of all colleges within commuting distance of each student, and showed that seniors have a wide range of colleges in proximity. Furthermore, after taking account of important student and zip code-level factors, the study found that each additional college in proximity is associated with a small but significant increase in the odds of applying to college, especially a four-year college. These findings suggest that researchers should stop treating the college-choice process as though it were independent of location and start situating this process within the geographic context in which it occurs.	1	Ruth N.

Sociology of Education	2009	1	Building on the literature that stresses the social capital advantages of open and diffuse social networks, this article shows that African American boys who are a social bridge across two or more large but cohesive peer groups are less delinquent than are their counterparts who are members of a single peer group. Statistical interaction terms reveal that this decrease in delinquency can be attributed to the increased influence of parents among social bridges. The article concludes that the network form of the adolescent society, independent of its composition, conditions the parent-child relationship.	1	William Mangino

Sociology of Education. 82:2 173-195.	Sociology of Education	2009	22	Because of segregation in neighborhoods and schools, college may provide the first opportunity for many young adults to interact closely with members of different racial and ethnic groups. Little research has examined how interracial friendships form during this period. This article investigates changes in the racial composition of friendship networks in the transition from high school to college and how aspects of the college environment are related to such changes. Interracial friendships increase for whites, decrease for blacks, and show little change for Latinos and Asians. The habits of friendship formation that are acquired during adolescence and features of residential and extracurricular college contexts influence the formation of interracial friendships. The race of one's roommate, the degree of interracial contact in residence halls, and participation in various types of extracurricular activities are most strongly related to the formation of interracial friendships.	3	Elizabeth Stearns; Claudia Buchmann; Kara Bonneau
Greener, Ian. 2009. 'Towards a History of Choice in Uk Health Policy.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:3 309-324.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	10	This paper examines health policy documents from the period in which the NHS was planned through to New Labour's reforms, to examine how the terms `choice' and `responsiveness' are used to position both users and the public in particular roles. It suggests that health consumerism is a process that has gradually appeared in the NHS through an extension of the choices offered to patients and the terms on which they were offered. Utilising Hirschman's classic framework of exit, voice and loyalty, we suggest that although there appears to be a strong relationship between the introduction of choice with the aim of securing greater responsiveness, that does not necessarily work in the opposite direction because the analysis of responsiveness suggests that there are other means of achieving this goal other than increasing choice through consumerist approaches to organisation. The implications of this analysis are explored for contemporary health service reform.	1	Ian Greener

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	4	Modern biomedicine is based on a number of novel institutions and practices that, in order to function, require some degree of formal and informal regulation. This paper contributes to the ongoing investigation of these processes, and the forms of objectivity they generate, by examining the emergence, development and deployment of Data Monitoring Committees in the field of clinical trials. The idea of a DMC had originally been raised in the clinical trial methodology literature in the 1970s so as to solve the problem of the management of interim trial data. Many leading clinical trial statisticians proposed that interim data and analyses be restricted to members of a DMC. Since the late 1980s, DMCs have evolved considerably in a constant search for ethical neutrality and objectivity through the use of sophisticated statistical techniques and novel organisational strategies. They have also been beset by a fundamental tension as to who or what should count as objective in such an undertaking. The paper examines the evolution of this institution in terms of the techniques brought to bear on the issues that they are expected to solve, the organisational forms through which DMCs have evolved and the ideals of objectivity that these forms embody.	2	Peter Keating; Alberto Cambrosio
Reed, Kate. 2009. '`it's Them Faulty Genes Again': Women, Men and the Gendered Nature of Genetic Responsibility in Prenatal Blood Screening.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:3 343-359.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	12	Prenatal blood tests are routinely offered to pregnant women in the UK. Male partners are tested only where a combined positive male and female test could detect fetal abnormality such as sickle cell anaemia. Little is known about the gendered nature of screening and the impact it has on lay feelings of genetic responsibility. For example, do women take exclusive `maternal responsibility' for the fetus? How is this responsibility challenged when men are also screened? Drawing on empirical research with pregnant women and their male partners in a northern city in the UK, this paper aims to explore the gendered nature of genetic responsibility in prenatal blood screening. The paper will argue that women and men feel a sense of genetic responsibility for the fetus throughout screening. However, while women's sense of responsibility is directly `embodied' and is heightened by the detection of `faulty genes', men's manifests itself indirectly through shared responsibility with their pregnant partners and directly through their own genetic connections to the fetus. The paper concludes that the gendered nature of genetic responsibility is complex and contradictory, producing a set of gender roles that both challenges and reinforces a traditional gender division of labour.	1	Kate Reed
Lee, Jessica & Doune Macdonald. 2009. 'Rural Young People and Physical Activity: Understanding Participation Through Social Theory.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:3 360-374.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	9	Studies from around the world point to the inadequate participation of young people in physical activity and sport, and the consequences of this on their health. However, very few interventions to increase the levels of physical activity amongst young people have been sustainable. The aim of this paper is to use Bourdieu's notions of the logic of practice along with habitus and capital to theorise young people's participation in physical activities to add to the wealth of empirical material. Data are drawn from a cohort of rural participants in an Australian longitudinal, qualitative research project with young people from diverse social, cultural and geographical backgrounds. It was found that traditional rural gender roles impact on young women's perceptions of legitimate physical activity options and practices. The role of the family in the reproduction of the social order which sustains gendered understandings of physical activity is also explored. This paper demonstrates how Bourdieu's theories can be applied to explain gender distinctions in health behaviours. It is proposed that building bridges between epidemiological and sociological understandings of participation in physical activities will lead to the generation of more equitable and sustainable physical activity and health promotion initiatives.	2	Jessica Lee; Doune Macdonald

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	3	This article takes the use of complementary medicine by a group of people living with HIV/AIDS as the starting point for exploring the options for living with chronic illness in contemporary western societies. Some authors have suggested that the situation of living with chronic illness may not be a significant departure from the process of negotiating choice that is theorised to be a defining feature of late-modern society and that there are now many ways of living with or `doing' chronic illness. This article uses these theoretical concepts to explore the experiences of people who have lived with HIV/AIDS for a number of years. It is argued that while different options for managing chronic illness may exist, it is not always possible or desirable for individuals to put these choices into practice. The article is based on 18 qualitative interviews with people living with HIV/AIDS who were using complementary medicine.	1	Rachel D. Thorpe
Oudshoorn, Nelly. 2009. 'Physical and Digital Proximity: Emerging Ways of Health Care in Face-to-face and Telemonitoring of Heart-failure Patients.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:3 390-405.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	5	The introduction of telehealth-care technologies profoundly changes existing practices of care. This paper aims to enhance our understanding of these changes by providing a comparative study of health-care services for heart-failure patients based on face-to-face contacts in a policlinic (department of a health care facility treating outpatients) and remote consultations at a telehealth-care centre. I will show how changes that take place when care moves from physical to virtual clinical encounters cannot be understood in terms of a replication of existing health-care services. Instead, it is more useful to conceptualise these health-care provisions as practices that create and value other kinds of care, incorporating different forms of proximity to patients. The physical proximity created at the policlinic facilitates contextualised, personalised care in which responsibilities for monitoring are delegated to nurses and patients and heart failure is constituted as an illness. The digital proximity that characterises the telehealth-care centre supports individualised, immediate care in which responsibilities are largely delegated to technological devices and heart failure is constituted as a disease. A major policy implication of these differences is that telehealth-care cannot simply replace physical consultations without changing the nature of health care.	1	Nelly Oudshoorn
Weiss, Marjorie & Jane Sutton. 2009. 'the Changing Nature of Prescribing: Pharmacists as Prescribers and Challenges to Medical Dominance.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:3 406-421.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	16	This paper investigates the potential threat to medical dominance posed by the addition of pharmacists as prescribers in the UK. It explores the role of prescribing as an indicator of professional power, the legitimacy and status of new pharmacist prescribers and the forces influencing professional jurisdictional claims over the task of prescribing. It draws upon 23 interviews with pharmacist supplementary prescribers. Data suggest that the legitimacy of pharmacists as prescribers, as experienced in the workplace, has been aided by: (1) blurred definitions of prescribing; (2) the emphasis on new prescribers' competence urging pharmacist prescribers to limit their areas of clinical practice; and (3) a team approach to patient management. Competence, self-limitation on practice and the benefits of team working as part of the ideology of patient safety were thus an important influence on pharmacists' jurisdictional claim over prescribing. While pharmacists have successfully negotiated a role for themselves as prescribers, medicine has retained its high status, relative to other health professionals and with patients; it controls the knowledge base relevant for prescribing practice and has managed to develop an `overseer' role over the process of prescribing. Prescribing, as an indicator of medicine's autonomy of control over their work and professional status, has changed. Yet the extent to which new prescribers have been able to threaten the professional dominance of medicine is debatable.	2	Marjorie C. Weiss; Jane Sutton

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	4	This paper studies the sensitivity of various health indicators to income inequality as measured by regional Gini coefficients, using individual microdata from Finland over the period 1993-2005. There is no overall association between income and health at the regional level. We discovered that, among men, there are no significant associations between income inequality and several measures of health status. Among women or among both sexes combined, there are some indications of associations in the predicted direction between income inequality and physical health, disability retirement, sick leave, and consumption of medicines, but none are robust to different model specifications. Only among the population aged less than 30 there is some indication that mental health is associated with inequality. Our findings confirm that income inequality in small populations (not large enough to measure the overall class pyramid of the society) is often immaterial for health outcomes.	4	Petri Bockerman; Edvard Johansson; Satu Helakorpi; Antti Uutela
Scambler, Graham. 2009. 'Health-related Stigma.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:3 441-455.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	47	The concept of stigma, denoting relations of shame, has a long ancestry and has from the earliest times been associated with deviations from the `normal', including, in various times and places, deviations from normative prescriptions of acceptable states of being for self and others. This paper dwells on modern social formations and offers conceptual and theoretical pointers towards a more convincing contemporary sociology of health-related stigma. It starts with an appreciation and critique of Goffman's benchmark sensitisation and traces his influence on the personal tragedy or deviance paradigm dominant in the medical sociology from the 1970s. To allow for the development of an argument, the focus here is on specific types of disorder - principally, epilepsy and HIV - rather than the research literature as a whole. Brief and critical consideration is given to attempts to operationalise or otherwise `measure' health-related stigma. The advocacy of a rival oppression paradigm by disability theorists from the 1980s, notably through re-workings of the social model of disability, is addressed. It is suggested that we are now in a position to learn and move on from this paradigm `clash'. A re-framing of notions of relations of stigma, signalling shame, and relations of deviance, signalling blame, is proposed. This framework, and the positing of a variable and changing dynamic between cultural norms of shame and blame - always embedded in social structures of class, command, gender, ethnicity and so on - is utilised to explore recent approaches to health stigma reduction programmes.	1	Graham Scambler
Blouin, David & Evelyn Perry. 2009. 'Whom Does Service Learning Really Serve? Community-based Organizations' Perspectives on Service Learning.' Teaching Sociology. 37:2 120-135.	Teaching Sociology	2009	5	One of the major selling points of service-learning courses is their potential to mutually benefit communities, universities, and students. Although a great deal of research reports numerous pedagogical and personal benefits for students-from improved grades and increased civic engagement to increased understanding and appreciation of diversity-there is relatively little research on the impact of service learning on the community. To understand when and how service-learning courses benefit the community, we conducted in-depth interviews with representatives of local community-based organizations that have worked with service learners. We report on the primary benefits and costs associated with service-learning courses. We identify three types of obstacles to successful service-learning courses: issues related to student conduct, poor fit between course and organizational objectives, and lack of communication between instructors and organizations. We develop practical guidelines for addressing these obstacles and for ensuring that service learning fulfills teaching and learning goals and provides valuable service to community-based organizations.	2	David D.

Teaching Sociology	2009	0	A course in the sociology of tourism offers an opportunity to examine a world-transforming force that is penetrating more and more aspects of social life. It also offers an opportunity to create a learning environment that uses the object of study as the medium of study. This article examines how instructors can use tourism to teach the sociology of tourism, and thereby help students develop an understanding of the subject matter through reflexive examination of classroom practice. Drawing on research in the sociology of tourism, it outlines a conceptual framework for thinking about tourism as a spatial practice that includes semiotic, interpersonal and cultural dimensions. Through examples, it shows how these dimensions can be synthesized into a pedagogical strategy that uses field trips and classroom learning to teach the sociology of tourism. The article addresses logistical and conceptual issues involved in course planning and implementation.	2	Shaul Kelner; George Sanders

Teaching Sociology	2009	3	The Integrating Data Analysis (IDA) approach to undergraduate education developed by the American Sociological Association (ASA) and the Social Science Data Analysis Network (SSDAN) has been embedded in the undergraduate sociology curriculum at Lehman College, The City University of New York (CUNY), since 2003. This study draws on student and faculty assessment data from the fall 2004 and spring 2006 semesters to evaluate the effectiveness of this initiative. The results show that students in courses with an IDA component significantly improved their performance on quantitative skills tests. Efforts to engage students in active learning through the use of computers were associated with increased student comfort and greater interest in working with data. In turn, students who were comfortable working with data exhibited especially high levels of quantitative skill. Although students who were taught a wide variety of data analysis skills reported greater interest in working with data, those who were taught a more limited range of skills achieved higher performance scores. Likewise, students who were required to complete assignments and undertake graded examinations that tested a wide range of quantitative skills had less interest in working with data but achieved greater improvements in their test scores.	1	Esther Isabelle Wilder

Madsen, Richard. 2009. 'the Archipelago of Faith: Religious Individualism and Faith Community in America Today.' American Journal of Sociology. 114:5 1263-1301.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	5	Through an interpretation of ethnographies of four very different religious communities, the author argues that there is a deep cultural commonality underlying the diversity of religious expression among the American middle classes. This commonality can be described in terms of religious individualism. But unlike previous accounts of religious individualism, this article emphasizes the ways in which it combines both ``seeking'' and ``dwelling'' and leads to both ``progressive'' and ``orthodox'' forms of religious expression.	1	Richard Madsen

American Journal of Sociology. 114:5 1302-1349.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	3	This article examines four movements of the religiously orthodox that should have failed according to most social movement theory and research. The movements combine (1) an extraordinarily broad agenda, (2) a strict, morally absolutist ideology, and (3) a strong proscription against compromise with other groups, each of which has been identified as a liability that can lead to movement failure. Through inductive, qualitative analyses, the authors identify four shared strategies that helped these movements overcome these obstacles: bypassing the state, building grassroots structures, providing graduated membership, and reprioritizing agendas. Analyses of these movements also suggest that particular combinations of movement ``liabilities'' may actually be advantageous.	2	Nancy J. Davis; Robert V. Robinson
Morgan, Kimberly & Monica Prasad. 2009. 'the Origins of Tax Systems: a French-american Comparison.' American Journal of Sociology. 114:5 1350-1394.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	4	This article examines the origins of tax systems. Through a historical comparison of France and the United States, and analysis of several shadow cases, the article explains why the United States has relied more heavily on progressive income taxation than France, which has favored regressive sales taxes. This study traces the origins of these two tax systems to the early 20th century, arguing that decisions about tax structure were shaped by resistance to the concentration of economic power in the United States and the centralization of state power in France. In the United States, the rapid concentration of economic power in the late 19th century spurred a political movement for a tax with clear redistributive purposes. In France, resistance to the centralization of state power and concomitant fears of ``fiscal inquisition'' weakened the drive for an effective income tax, leaving the state to rely on consumption taxes to meet its revenue needs. These 19th-century movements of resistance to modernization shaped the foundations of contemporary political economy.	2	Kimberly J. Morgan; Monica Prasad

American Journal of Sociology	2009	4	Do regime change and market reform disrupt patterns of intergenerational mobility? China's political trajectory is distinctive from that of other communist regimes in two ways. During its first three decades, the regime enforced unusually restrictive barriers to elite status inheritance. And during the subsequent market transition, unlike most of its counterparts, the Communist Party survived intact. Data from a multigeneration survey suggest that despite their obvious exclusion from the party and related administrative careers in the Mao era, certain prerevolution elites transmitted one type of elite status to their offspring to a surprising degree. Party elites, in contrast, were hit hard by radical Maoism but recovered quickly afterward, and their offspring inherited elite status at much higher rates.	2	Andrew G. Walder; Songhua Hu

American Journal of Sociology	2009	22	This article revives the debate over whether women's upward mobility prospects decline as they climb organizational hierarchies. Although this proposition is a core element of the ``glass ceiling'' metaphor, it has failed to gain strong support in previous research. The article establishes a firm theoretical foundation for expecting an increasing female disadvantage, with an eye toward defining the scope conditions and extending the model to upper-level external hires. The approach is illustrated in an empirical setting that meets the proposed scope conditions: corporate law firms in the United States. Results confirm that in this setting, the female mobility disadvantage is greater at higher organizational levels in the case of internal promotions, but not in the case of external hires.	2	Elizabeth H.

American Journal of Sociology	2009	47	In their widely cited study, Shavit and Blossfeld report stability of socioeconomic inequalities in educational attainment over much of the 20th century in 11 out of 13 countries. This article outlines reasons why one might expect to find declining class inequalities in educational attainment, and, using a large data set, the authors analyze educational inequality among cohorts born in the first two-thirds of the 20th century in eight European countries. They find, as expected, a widespread decline in educational inequality between students coming from different social origins. Their results are robust to other possible choices of method and variables, and the authors offer some explanations of why their findings contradict Shavit and Blossfeld's conclusions.	4	Richard Breen; Ruud Luijkx; Walter Muller; Reinhard Pollak
Hipp, John & Andrew Perrin. 2009. 'the Simultaneous Effect of Social Distance and Physical Distance on the Formation of Neighborhood Ties.' City \& Community. 8:1 5-25.	City \& Community	2009	24	Prior studies have separately suggested the importance of physical distance or social distance effects for the creation of neighborhood ties. This project adopts a case study approach and simultaneously tests for propinquity and homophily effects on neighborhood ties by employing a full-network sample from a recently developed New Urbanist neighborhood within a mid-sized southern city. The authors find that physical distance reduces the likelihood of weak or strong ties forming, suggesting the importance of accounting for propinquity when estimating social tie formation. The authors simultaneously find that social distance along wealth reduces the likelihood of weak ties forming. Social distance on life course markers-age, marital status, and the presence of children-reduces the formation of weak ties. Consistent with the systemic model, each additional month of shared residence in the neighborhood increases both weak and strong ties. An important innovation is this study's ability to directly compare the effects of physical distance and social distance, placing them into equivalent units: a 10 percent increase in home value difference is equivalent to a 5.6 percent increase in physical distance.	2	John R.

Greif, Meredith. 2009. 'Neighborhood Attachment in the Multiethnic Metropolis.' City \& Community. 8:1 27-45.	City \& Community	2009	9	In acknowledging that patterns of neighborhood attachment-a key component in the maintenance of neighborhood vitality-may shift as a result of growing racial and ethnic diversity, this study develops a multiethnic and multilevel framework to examine the link between racial diversity and attachment among Los Angeles residents. The expansion of the Asian and Hispanic populations may affect attachment patterns if group members exhibit different levels of attachment compared with blacks and whites, due to factors such as illegal citizenship and poorer neighborhood resources. Additionally, their presence in neighborhoods may influence other residents' attachment by triggering racial prejudice or concerns about local resources. Using the 2001 Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (LAFANS), this analysis demonstrates that Asians and Hispanics modestly diverge from blacks and whites in the strength of their attachment, due in part to individual and neighborhood characteristics. Although the neighborhood presence of blacks and Hispanics moderately diminishes some aspects of residents' attachment, regardless of individual race, in many instances neighborhood racial composition fails to exert a significant impact on neighborhood attachment.	1	Meredith J.

Zukin, Sharon, Valerie Trujillo, Peter Frase, Danielle Jackson, Tim Recuber & Abraham Walker. 2009. 'New Retail Capital and Neighborhood Change: Boutiques and Gentrification in New York City.' City \& Community. 8:1 47-64.	City \& Community	2009	19	Since the 1970s, certain types of upscale restaurants, cafEs, and stores have emerged as highly visible signs of gentrification in cities all over the world. Taking Harlem and Williamsburg as field sites, we explore the role of these new stores and services (''boutiques'') as agents of change in New York City through data on changing composition of retail and services, interviews with new store owners, and discursive analysis of print media. Since the 1990s, the share of boutiques, including those owned by small local chains, has dramatically increased, while the share of corporate capital (large chain stores) has increased somewhat, and the share of traditional local stores and services has greatly declined. The media, state, and quasi-public organizations all value boutiques, which they see as symbols and agents of revitalization. Meanwhile, new retail investors-many, in Harlem, from the new black middle class-are actively changing the social class and ethnic character of the neighborhoods. Despite owners' responsiveness to community identity and racial solidarity, ``boutiquing'' calls attention to displacement of local retail stores and services on which long-term, lower class residents rely and to the state's failure to take responsibility for their retention, especially in a time of economic crisis.	6	Sharon Zukin; Valerie Trujillo; Peter Frase; Danielle Jackson; Tim Recuber; Abraham Walker
Jaret, Charles, Ravi Ghadge, Lesley Reid & Robert Adelman. 2009. 'the Measurement of Suburban Sprawl: an Evaluation.' City \& Community. 8:1 65-84.	City \& Community	2009	2	We review and analyze how suburban sprawl has been conceptualized and measured in recent urban research. We find that indexes created to measure sprawl in metropolitan areas do so in three different ways. Some measures are based on residential population density, others specifically measure the extent of job or employment sprawl, and others consider sprawl a multidimensional land use phenomenon (and provide separate indexes for each dimension). Our analyses show that (1) most residential population density indexes reflect other dimensions of sprawl; (2) it is useful to think of metropolitan areas as positioned on two distinct dimensions of sprawl (i.e., centeredness and density-mixed land use); and (3) job sprawl and residential sprawl vary independently from each other. We provide recommendations regarding which sprawl measures are most appropriate for research applications.	4	Charles Jaret; Ravi Ghadge; Lesley Williams Reid; Robert M. Adelman
Small, Mario. 2009. '`how Many Cases Do I Need?' on Science and the Logic of Case Selection in Field-based Research.' Ethnography. 10:1 5-38.	Ethnography	2009	52	Today, ethnographers and qualitative researchers in fields such as urban poverty, immigration, and social inequality face an environment in which their work will be read, cited, and assessed by demographers, quantitative sociologists, and even economists. They also face a demand for case studies of poor, minority, or immigrant groups and neighborhoods that not only generate theory but also somehow speak to empirical conditions in other cases (not observed). Many have responded by incorporating elements of quantitative methods into their designs, such as selecting respondents `at random' for small, in-depth interview projects or identifying `representative' neighborhoods for ethnographic case studies, aiming to increase generalizability. This article assesses these strategies and argues that they fall short of their objectives. Recognizing the importance of the predicament underlying the strategies - to determine how case studies can speak empirically to other cases - it presents two alternatives to current practices, and calls for greater clarity in the logic of design when producing ethnographic research in a multi-method intellectual environment.	1	Mario Luis Small
Ferrandiz, Francisco. 2009. 'Open Veins Spirits of Violence and Grief in Venezuela.' Ethnography. 10:1 39-61.	Ethnography	2009	1	Transnational processes of stigmatization and criminalization of poverty associated to neoliberal models of development unfold locally in various modalities and intensities of de-pacification of everyday life. In this framework, this article presents the case study of a well-known spirit possession devotion in Venezuela, the cult of Mar a Lionza, where the enormous symbolic, structural and repressive pressure exerted on shantytown dwellers, particularly male youngsters, is recycled in a sort of corporeal videoclip - in a cluster of controversial and highly spectacular ritual practices based on self-mutilation and bloodletting. Using Eduardo Galeano's celebrated dictum of the `Open Veins of Latin America', taken in this article both metaphorically and literally, these intense rituals are understood as deeply embodied roadmaps to everyday violence and stigma, in the context of barrio - shantytown - male youth cultures and re-elaborations of popular memories of slavery and legendary sagas.	1	Francisco Ferrandiz
Garot, Robert. 2009. 'Reconsidering Retaliation Structural Inhibitions, Emotive Dissonance, and the Acceptance of Ambivalence Among Inner-city Young Men.' Ethnography. 10:1 63-90.	Ethnography	2009	4	Contemporary criminology directs a great deal of attention toward the factors which may lead to crime and violence, but little attention to individuals in circumstances which fit all the necessary conditions but who abstain from criminal or violent acts. This is in marked contrast to the law and society literature, where `lumping it' (Felstiner, 1974) has long been recognized as the overwhelming default response in most disputes. This article examines this criminological gap, exploring the emotive dissonance and ambivalence experienced by young men who abstain from retaliating due to structural constraints. Each one, faced with an agonizing loss, is compelled to seek violent retaliation against the antagonist perceived responsible for the loss. Yet each is constrained by their enmeshment in the local social structure and the potential havoc that such violence might bring. Furthermore, by focusing primarily on moments of violence, criminology misses the enormous range of nonviolent moments, among both violent offenders and others. Exploring each consultant's existential gap will enrich our understanding of the criminological gap between independent and dependent variables, toward appreciating the agency and resourcefulness of young men caught in potentially violent dilemmas.	1	Robert Garot

This article uses empirical evidence from interviews with young people to suggest that claims of `new community' are overstated, traditional forms of friendship are receding, and increasingly atomized and instrumental youth identities are now being culturally constituted and reproduced by the pressures and anxieties created by enforced adaptation to consumer capitalism. Analysis of the data opens up the possibility of a critical rather than a celebratory exploration of the wider theoretical implications of this process.	2	Simon Winlow; Steve Hall
Williksen, Solrun. 2009. 'Moods Behind the Silences.' Ethnography. 10:1 115-127.	Ethnography	2009	1	This article reflects on encounters that took place while doing fieldwork in Fiji. The writer thinks back on moods and acts that were, and still are, only partly understood. The writer has in earlier works discussed how Fijian people adhere to strict rules for body comportment and social intercourse, not least in their elaborate ceremonies that seem to continue unabated even in the urban areas. These rules are related to the status hierarchy of the chiefly system where communal values of kinship and social obligations reign supreme. Togetherness and a constant adjustment to others' expectations are the norms. A person seems hardly ever to be alone or free from obligations or duties to perform in one way or the other. This article, however, is a more personal account of people who became friends of the writer during fieldwork and yet in certain aspects, as the writer thinks back, remain riddles.	1	Solrun Williksen
Rottman, Andy, Christopher Fariss & Steven Poe. 2009. 'the Path to Asylum in the Us and the Determinants for Who Gets in and Why.' International Migration Review. 43:1 3-34.	International Migration Review	2009	6	The migration of political asylum seekers into the United States has long been a salient political topic; however, social scientists have yet to examine this process in its entirety and in the context of political changes since September 11, 2001. Previous research shows that humanitarian and strategic interests are important for decisions made by asylum officers but that research overlooks the decisions made by immigration judges. Here we examine decisions made by both asylum officers and immigration judges using data from a global set of countries, from 1999 to 2004. We find that the waning importance of human rights is more pronounced for asylum officers than for immigration judges after the attack on the World Trade Center. We also find that language heritage, specifically for asylum seekers from English-, Spanish-, and Arabic-speaking countries, substantially affects acceptance rates made by both decision-makers between the two time periods of our study.	3	Andy J.

Laitin, David. 2009. 'Immigrant Communities and Civil War.' International Migration Review. 43:1 35-59.	International Migration Review	2009	2	This paper explains why international migrants, who face numerous security and cultural threats in their host societies, are almost never implicated in civil war violence. This is quite different from situations of internal migration, which often set off violence that escalates to civil war proportions. The paper first lays out the stark contrast between the political implications of external and internal migration based on data adapted from the Minorities at Risk (MAR) dataset. It then explores the reasons for the low incidence of civil war violence for international migrants through an examination of three cases: Bahrain, which has a large expatriate community without political rights that has been politically quiescent; Estonia, where some 30 percent of the population are disaffected Russian-speakers linked to post-World War II migrations from other republics of the Soviet Union; and Pakistan, where the immigrant Muhajirs are a partial exception to the general pattern outlined in this paper. It concludes with a general statement of the relationship between immigration and rebellion, where the level of grievances is less consequential than the conditions that make insurgency pay off.	1	David D.

Scott, Sam & Kim Cartledge. 2009. 'Migrant Assimilation in Europe: a Transnational Family Affair.' International Migration Review. 43:1 60-89.	International Migration Review	2009	3	The paper advances our empirical and theoretical understanding of migrant assimilation. It does so by focusing on a very particular group of individuals who appear more likely than other migrant types to ``go native.'' We call these individuals ``mixed nationality relationship migrants'' (i.e., migrants who have committed to a life outside their home country because of the presence of a foreign partner). The paper argues that the transnational family milieus that emerge from this form of international migration are critical to the assimilation process. Empirical material from 11 in-depth interviews with female migrants in Britain (Sheffield) and France (Paris) supports our argument. We also suggest that such ``extreme'' assimilation is more likely within a regional migratory system - like the EU - where the ``identity frontiers'' crossed in the formation of a transnational family are relatively shallow.	2	Sam Scott; Kim H.

International Migration Review	2009	1	Many in Europe believe that large numbers of Turkish immigrants have failed to integrate into their host communities. How is this situation in Sweden? We found that most of the Turkish immigrants felt themselves to be Turkish and Sweden was accepted as a foreign country. Turkish-originated media was followed frequently and strong ties with relatives in Turkey were maintained. Marriage and friendship with native Swedes were not well accepted. We concluded that despite the multicultural aspects of Swedish integration policies, Turkish immigrants in Sweden were not well integrated and they prefer to live within the boundaries of their segregated, closed, small communities.	4	Nuran Bayram; Hans Nyquist; Daniel Thorburn; Nazan Bilgel
Mascini, Peter & Marjolein Bochove. 2009. 'Gender Stereotyping in the Dutch Asylum Procedure: ``independent'' Men Versus ``dependent'' Women.' International Migration Review. 43:1 112-133.	International Migration Review	2009	1	Attention for discrimination against women in asylum law has grown considerably during the last few decades. Yet it is male claimants who have had smaller success Rates in the asylum procedures of different countries. Using administrative data from the Dutch INS, we show this difference is caused by the traditionally gendered migration pattern of asylum seekers. Men have a smaller success rate than women because they are less likely than women to have a spouse or children, are less likely to follow their spouse to the country of destination, and are more likely to come from countries considered to be safe. This suggests that men are less successful in their attempts to seek asylum because they better fit the image of ``bogus'' refugees, while women more clearly match the image of ``victim of patriarchal domination.''.	2	Peter Mascini; Marjolein Bochove
Bilodeau, Antoine. 2009. 'Residential Segregation and the Electoral Participation of Immigrants in Australia.' International Migration Review. 43:1 134-159.	International Migration Review	2009	0	This paper investigates whether immigrants in Australia residing in situations of residential segregation (federal constituencies with high concentrations of immigrants) participate more in electoral politics than other immigrants. The results indicate that immigrants participate more when living in federal constituencies with high concentrations of immigrants and also exhibit greater homogeneity in their partisan preferences. The analysis also indicates that the impact of residential segregation is primarily observed among immigrants from non-English-speaking countries. Immigrants from visible minority background, such as those from South East Asia as well as those from Southern and South Eastern Europe, tend to be more strongly affected by the ethnic composition of their constituencies than other immigrants such as those from the United Kingdom and Ireland.	1	Antoine Bilodeau

Unlike previous research it accounts for potential endogeneity in the relationship between remittances and intentions and also includes households that receive remittances but do not have current migrants. We find a positive impact of remittances on intentions. The impact of remittances on intentions is stronger in a country with a longer history of migration and stronger in households with current migrants than those without migrants. These results provide new evidence on the role of remittances in the development of migration chains.	1	Gareth Leeves
Liu-Farrer, Gracia. 2009. 'Educationally Channeled International Labor Mobility: Contemporary Student Migration From China to Japan.' International Migration Review. 43:1 178-204.	International Migration Review	2009	5	International education is an important channel of labor migration. Most commonly, this form of labor migration is considered as ``brain drain,'' represented by the retention of graduate students in science and engineering in the host labor market. This case study of contemporary Chinese student migration to Japan shows that international students have different credentials, interests, and motivations for migrating abroad, and consequently provide the host society both unskilled and skilled labor power. Moreover, Chinese students' labor market practices as skilled labor migrants show their important roles in the economic globalization. Aside from scientific and engineering skills, Chinese students use their linguistic and cultural competencies to act as intermediaries between their host and home economies.	1	Gracia Liu-Farrer

International Migration Review	2009	10	A young age at arrival is believed to be an important predictor of adult immigrant achievement, but there is no consensus on what age(s) at arrival is pivotal/crucial/critical. The 2000 census reports exact years of arrival and age providing us the opportunity to test different formulations for age-at-arrival effects for several different socioeconomic outcomes. We focus on the experiences of Mexican immigrants to the U.S. in this study. Our results indicate That the effect of early arrival is much greater for English proficiency than other outcomes and bears significantly on most, not all, attainments. There is little evidence at any age of a sharp discontinuity demarcating a 1.5 generation from older immigrants and, in fact, a series of classifications or a continuous measurement of age at arrival may be preferred in some cases. Guidelines are offered for the most appropriate formulation of age at arrival under different contexts.	3	Dowell Myers; Xin Gao; Amon Emeka

'Size, Conflict, and Opportunities for Interaction: Congregational Effects on Members' Anticipated Support and Negative Interaction.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 48:1 1-15.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	11	A growing literature examines the role of religious communities as sources of social support for members, and a smaller body of work also explores negative aspects of social relations within congregations. However, very little is known about the characteristics of religious groups that promote or impede the development of supportive networks. We use data from a unique source-the National Congregations Study, linked with individual records from the 1998 General Social Survey (GSS)-to explore this issue. Key findings reveal that: (1) individuals who attend very large churches tend to report lower levels of anticipated support and informal negative interaction; (2) the presence of major congregational conflict tends to dampen anticipated support and increase informal negative interaction; and (3) the absence of a well-defined period for informal socializing before or after the worship service is associated with lower levels of anticipated support, but is unrelated to the frequency of negative interaction among church members. Several implications and promising directions for future research are discussed.	4	Christopher G. Ellison; Neal M. Krause; Bryan C. Shepherd; Mark A. Chaves

This article advances research on religious homophily by including the role that exclusive theological beliefs play in explaining religious homophily among friends. We lay out three propositions for individual-, congregational-, and cross-level effects on the relationship between exclusive theology and embeddedness within one's congregation. Using multilevel models and data from the U.S. Congregational Life Survey (USCLS), we find support for our three propositions. We discuss our findings in terms of how exclusive theologies may contribute to bonding forms of social capital, but limit exposure to diverse social perspectives and bridging forms of social capital.	2	Christopher P.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	5	Drawing upon the cultural repertoire and religious marketplace perspectives, this study examines the extent to which ecstatic, participatory worship practices are distinctive to African-American congregations and explores the role that ecstatic, participatory worship plays in contemporary African-American worship. National Congregations Study (NCS) data are used to conduct comparative analyses of African-American and white congregations' participation in two forms of ecstatic, participatory worship: verbal affirmation and spontaneous physical worship. Findings suggest that while spontaneous physical worship is distinctive to the religiocultural repertoires of African-American congregations, verbal affirmation is not. Traditional explanations about the origin of ecstatic, participatory worship, such as religious tradition, Pentecostalism, and social class, are less compelling than they were in the past. For contemporary African-American congregations, ecstatic, participatory worship is no longer associated with marginal or less-educated congregations, but with more sociopolitically and religiously progressive ones.	1	Korie L.

Synthesizing ethnographic data drawn from two extensive case studies, the article provides a heuristic model for understanding the process by which members of disparate ethnic and racial heritages come to identify and achieve stable affiliation with multiethnic/multiracial congregations. Three ``moments'' (affinity with the congregation, identity reorientation, and ethnic transcendence) represent key phases in the lived religious experience of members as they co-construct common bonds of spiritual kinship.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	1	Fundamentalists typically avoid influences from the outside world and form intense social bonds with members of their own group. Yet, active fundamentalists must create relationships with the objects of their missionary action, the Other. In this article I address the connections between the cultural practice of missionary work and the formation and maintenance of social ties among ultra-Orthodox Jewish missionaries belonging to the fundamentalist Hasidic sect Chabad-Lubavitch. These missionaries attempt to bring Jews to the beliefs and practices of Chabad by hosting Jews at Sabbath meals. This missionary act is an utterance that ``speaks'' with multiple voices, indexing the missionaries as both friendly members of their local Jewish community and ideal Lubavitchers. Through these meals, the missionaries engage not only the local Jews but also other Lubavitchers in dialogue, constructing a community that transcends face-to-face interaction.	1	Elise Berman

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	3	This article focuses on the perceptions of baalei teshuvah, Jews who were raised with little identification with Judaism as a religious system and subsequently became Orthodox, as an example of the social integration of a group that migrates from one community to another. The baalei teshuvah participants perceived themselves as unique and distinct from those who were raised Orthodox and preferred to associate with others like themselves. They experienced a mixture of pride in their own religious fervor and embarrassment over their lack of knowledge compared with those who grew up Orthodox. At the same time they expressed ambivalent feelings toward Jews who were raised Orthodox. Immigration theory and the concepts of human, social, religious, and spiritual capital are used to discuss the baalei teshuvah's marginal status and preference to associate with other baalei teshuvah..	1	Roberta G.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 48:1 103-120.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	2	This article investigates whether the prevalence of conservative churches, which has been associated with variation in demographic patterns in Western Europe (Lesthaeghe and Neels 2002), can explain geographic differences in family demographic patterns-specifically fertility-in the U.S. nonblack population. Lesthaeghe and Neels find that a second demographic transition (SDT)-characterized by increasing prevalence of nontraditional family and household structure-is hindered by the presence of strong conservative religious institutions. The high religiosity of the United States compared with Western Europe makes it an interesting test case for the theory. This article analyzes the relationship between nonblack fertility and rates of membership in conservative Protestant and Latter Day Saint churches (conservative churches) among nonblacks in U.S. counties and shows that conservative church membership indeed is an independent factor in geographic differences in family demographic patterns-especially with regard to the timing of parenting, but less so with regard to nonmarital childbearing.	1	Emory Morrison

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	2	Utilizing a cultural-developmental approach, this interview study examined how children, adolescents, and adults from religiously liberal and conservative groups conceptualize God and the Devil. Participants (N = 120) conceptualized God and the Devil along similar dimensions, including number (e.g., one, many), gender, central attributes (e.g., physical, supernatural), and evaluation (e.g., positive, neutral). Within-subject differentiations of God and the Devil occurred on all dimensions. Religiously liberal and conservative groups differed on attributes, evaluations, and degree of control ascribed to God and the Devil. With respect to age, results suggest a rethinking of the Piagetian interpretation that children's conceptions of supernatural entities are more concrete, more anthropomorphic, and less abstract than those of adolescents and adults. The results instead point to the usefulness of a cultural-developmental approach.	1	Lene Arnett Jensen
Ford, Thomas, Thomas Brignall, Thomas VanValey & Michael Macaluso. 2009. 'the Unmaking of Prejudice: How Christian Beliefs Relate to Attitudes Toward Homosexuals.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 48:1 146-160.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	8	We propose that the internalization of orthodox Christian beliefs serves as a basis for a personal moral standard that discourages prejudice against others as well as for self-critical emotions that follow upon behaving in a discriminatory manner. Two correlational studies tested hypotheses derived from our theory. Study 1 demonstrated that to the extent people endorse orthodox Christian beliefs, they report an internal motivation to respond without prejudice toward homosexuals. Study 2 demonstrated that, when controlling for the effects of right-wing authoritarianism (RWA), endorsement of orthodox Christian beliefs was related to positive attitudes toward homosexuals as individuals or as a group, but not toward homosexuality as a behavior or lifestyle.	4	Thomas E.

Peterson, Scot. 2009. 'Rational Choice, Religion, and the Marketplace: Where Does Adam Smith Fit In?.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 48:1 185-192.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	2	Rational choice theorists of religion have assumed that Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations advocates a free market in religion, which, they argue, leads to increased religious vitality. In fact, while Smith opposed direct government subsidies for religion and argued that a free market was the first-best solution, as a second-best policy he advocated religious regulation, including state-appointed clergy and the reduction of clergy income. Smith's rational choice approach to religion, which springs from his understanding of public goods, externalities and the need for civil peace, and government stability, can still provide direction for social scientific research, but it does not always support a policy of religious free markets.	1	Scot M.

'Psychosocial and Biological Markers of Daily Lives of Midlife Parents of Children With Disabilities.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:1 1-15.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	34	Using daily telephone interviews, 82 midlife parents (mean age = 57.4) of children with disabilities (mean age = 29.9) were compared with a closely matched sample of unaffected parents (N = 82) to elucidate the daily experience of non-normative parenting. In addition, salivary cortisol samples were obtained to examine whether parents of children with disabilities had dysregulated diurnal rhythms and the extent to which the amount of time spent with children was associated with divergent patterns of cortisol expression. We found that parents of children with disabilities had similar patterns of daily time use and similar likelihood of positive daily events as the comparison group, but they had elevated levels of stress, negative affect, and physical symptoms, all reported on a daily basis. In addition, their diurnal rhythm of cortisol expression differed significantly from the comparison group, a pattern that was strongest,for parents of children with disabilities on days when they spent more time with their children.	7	Marsha Mailick Seltzer; David M.

Nobles, Jenna & Elizabeth Frankenberg. 2009. 'Mothers' Community Participation and Child Health.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:1 16-30.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	6	We use rich data from the Indonesia Family Life Survey to assess the relationship between mothers' access to social capital via participation in community activities and their children's health. We exploit the advantages of longitudinal data and commnunity fixed effects to mitigate some of the concerns about spuriousness and reverse causality that predominate in this literature. We find that children from families with relatively love, levels of human and financial capital fare better with respect to health status when their mothers are more active participants in community organizations. In fact, the association between maternal participation and child health is strong and positive only for children from relatively disadvantaged backgrounds, as measured by their mothers' educational and household economic resources. The results suggest that in poorer settings community involvement may benefit disadvantaged families, possibly by providing resources and information that would otherwise be inaccessible.	2	Jenna Nobles; Elizabeth Frankenberg
Cornwell, Erin & Linda Waite. 2009. 'Social Disconnectedness, Perceived Isolation, and Health Among Older Adults.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:1 31-48.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	66	Previous research has identified a wide range of indicators of social isolation that pose health risks, including living alone, having a small social network, infrequent participation in social activities, and feelings of loneliness. However, multiple forms of isolation are rarely studied together: making it difficult to determine which aspects of isolation are most deleterious for health. Using population-based data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project, we combine multiple indicators of social isolation into scales assessing social disconnectedness (e.g., small social network, infrequent participation in social activities) and perceived isolation (e.g., loneliness, perceived lack of social support). We examine the extent to which social disconnectedness and perceived isolation have distinct associations with physical and mental health among older adults. Results indicate that social disconnectedness and perceived isolation are independently associated with lower levels of self-rated physical health. However; the association between disconnectedness and mental health may operate through the strong relationship between perceived isolation and mental health. We conclude that health researchers need to consider social disconnectedness and perceived isolation simultaneously.	2	Erin York Cornwell; Linda J. Waite
Ross, Catherine & John Mirowsky. 2009. 'Neighborhood Disorder, Subjective Alienation, and Distress.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:1 49-64.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	37	Living in a threatening, noxious, and dangerous neighborhood may produce anxiety; anger, and depression because it is subjectively alienating. We hypothesize that neighborhood disorder represents ambient threat that elicits perceptions of powerlessness, normlessness, mistrust, and isolation. These perceptions in turn lead to anxious and angry agitation, and depressed exhaustion. We use data from the 1995 Community, Crime, and Health survey, a probability sample of 2,482 adults in Illinois, with a follow-up survey in 1998. We find that perceived neighborhood disorder is associated with high levels of anxiety; anger; and depression. Personal victimization mediates about 10 percent of the association. The rest of the association is mediated primarily by mistrust and, secondarily, by perceived powerlessness. Normlessness reflects neighborhood disorder, but it appears to have little influence oil distress. Social isolation has trade-offs in its connections to neighborhood disorder and to distress.	2	Catherine E. Ross; John Mirowsky

Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:1 65-81.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	11	This study examines pathways to adult marijuana and cocaine use in a cohort of African Americans from Woodlawn, an inner city community in Chicago. Assessments were conducted in first grade (age 6), adolescence (age 16), early adulthood (age 32), and in mid-adulthood (age 42). The ``social adaptation life course'' framework guided the focus on social adaptation, social bonds, and economic resources as predictors of adult drug use. Results indicate that more frequent substance use in adolescence and lower-income and less frequent church attendance in early adulthood increase the risk of mid-life drug use. Shyness in first grade related inversely to later cocaine use and marijuana use (marginally significant). Indirect pathways to drug use also were identified. Gender differences were not significant. The findings show continuities in social maladaptation over time and the importance of social integration and economic resources in the early adult years.	5	Kate E. Fothergill; Margaret E.

'Ethnic Differences in Trajectories of Depressive Symptoms: Disadvantage in Family Background, High School Experiences, and Adult Characteristics.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:1 82-98.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	16	Although research investigating ethnic differences in mental health has increased in recent years, we know relatively little about how mental health trajectories vary across ethnic groups. Do these differences occur at certain ages but not others? We investigate ethnic variation in trajectories of depressive symptoms, and we examine the extent to which disadvantages in family background, high school experiences, and adult characteristics explain these differences. Employing random-coefficient modeling using the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, we find that blacks and Hispanics experience higher symptom levels in early adulthood in comparison to whites, but equivalent levels by middle age. Ethnic differences remained in early adulthood after including all covariates, but those differences were eliminated by middle age for-Hispanics after controlling for demographics only, and for blacks after accounting for the age-varying relationship between income and depressive symptoms. These results highlight the importance of integrating a life course perspective when investigating ethnic variations in mental health.	3	Katrina M. Walsemann; Gilbert C. Gee; Arline T. Geronimus

Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:1 99-114.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	11	A, sense of mastery is an important component of psychological health and wellbeing across the life-span; however, relatively little is known about the development of mastery during childhood and adolescence. Utilizing prospective, longitudinal data from 444 adolescent sibling pairs and their parents, out-conceptual model proposes that family socioeconomic status (SES) in the form of parental education promotes effective family problem-solving, which, in turn, fosters adolescent mastery. Results show: (7) a significant increase in mastery for younger and older siblings, (2) parental education promoted effective problem-solving between parents and adolescents and between siblings but not between the parents themselves, and (3) all forms of effective family problem-solving predicted greater adolescent mastery. Parental education had a direct effect on adolescent mastery as well as the hypothesized indirect effect through problem-solving effectiveness, suggesting bout a social structural and social process influence on the development of mastery during adolescence.	5	Katherine Jewsbury Conger; Shannon Tierney Williams; Wendy M.

Starks, Brian. 2009. 'Self-identified Traditional, Moderate, and Liberal Catholics: Movement-based Identities or Something Else?.' Qualitative Sociology. 32:1 1-32.	Qualitative Sociology	2009	4	Through qualitative analyses of 50 in-depth interviews with Catholics in three Midwestern cities, I investigate the role of religious movement organizations in the formation of Catholic identities. I find that movement organizations and elites tend to have little direct impact on the formation of Catholic parishioners' identities in my sample. While movements' disruptions and interactions with media are useful for generating debate and wider recognition of religious disagreements, my respondents are not usually socialized by nor do they identify with familiar movements when they call themselves traditional, moderate, and liberal. Most are uninterested in and unacquainted with movement organizations and publications. Instead, their religious identification is a form of religious mapping, which reflects their self-understood position vis-A -vis recognized cultural conflicts within the larger religious community. While movements play a limited role, I argue that we should be wary of conceptualizing Catholic identities as products of movement groups or parachurch networks since most Catholic identity-work occurs within families and parishes, as opposed to movements or parachurch organizations.	1	Brian Starks
Dreby, Joanna. 2009. 'Gender and Transnational Gossip.' Qualitative Sociology. 32:1 33-52.	Qualitative Sociology	2009	12	Transnational social networks powerfully shape Mexican migration and enable families to stretch internationally. In an atmosphere of such high dependence on social networks, it would be rare for families not to be affected by the opinions of others. This article analyzes this often-overlooked aspect of social networks, gossip. I analyze gossip stories prevalent for one type of migrant family, those in which parents and children live apart. Drawing on over 150 ethnographic interviews and observation with members of Mexican transnational families and their neighbors in multiple sites, I describe both parents' and children's experiences with transnational gossip. I show that in a transnational context, gossip is a highly gendered activity with different consequences for men and women. Although targeting both women and men, transnational gossip reinforces the expectations that mothers be family caregivers and fathers be family providers even when physical separation makes these activities difficult to accomplish.	1	Joanna Dreby
Dufur, Mikaela & Seth Feinberg. 2009. 'Race and the Nfl Draft: Views From the Auction Block.' Qualitative Sociology. 32:1 53-73.	Qualitative Sociology	2009	4	Previous research suggests that minorities are more likely to perceive racially-based discrimination in a variety of settings than are whites, in large part because of the ways their personal experiences with racism shape the lens they use to view the world. We examine a labor market that is typically considered an exception to patterns of racism in employment, the industry of professional football. We interview athletes who attempted to gain employment in the National Football League, a labor market where access to valued positions is heavily restricted by industry practices. Findings from field research and semi-structured interviews indicate that minority workers experience symbolic discrimination during the hiring process. Differential treatment of players reflects stereotypes about minority families and masculinity. Although minority and white players describe much of the actual content of their labor market experiences in similar fashion, their perceptions of these experiences differ sharply, with minority athletes identifying far more negative repercussions.	2	Mikaela J.

Using a mixed methodology of participant observation, staff interviews, and comparison of facilities' official data, I analyze these patterns in relation to the rules of the CurvesA (R) system and the possible factors that contribute to the observable differences across the two facilities. I argue that despite the corporate mandate for rapid and rationalized (McDonaldized) fitness, local CurvesA (R) organizational cultures and client preferences may constitute internal resistance to the McDonaldization process.	1	Laura L.

Qualitative Sociology	2009	10	This article dissects the author's approach to ethnography, social theory, and the politics of knowledge through a dialogue retracing his intellectual trajectory and the analytic linkages between his inquiries into embodiment, comparative urban marginality and the penal state. It draws out the practical connections and epistemological rationale behind his main research projects, explicates the distinctive ways in which he deploys observational fieldwork in each of them, and examines the roles of intellectuals in advanced society in the era of hegemonic neoliberalism. Rejecting both Humean empiricism and neo-Kantian cognitivism, the author argues for the use of ethnography as an instrument of rupture and construction, the potency of carnal knowledge, the imperative of epistemic reflexivity, and the need to expand textual genres and styles so as to better capture the taste and ache of social action. In the public sphere, he proposes that social science can act as a solvent of doxa and a beacon casting light on latent properties and unnoticed trends in social transformations so as to disrupt and broaden civic debate.	1	Loic Wacquant
Tabory, Ephraim & Sharon Levtzur. 2009. 'Crossing the Threshold: State, Religion, and Opposition to Legally-imposed Religious Weddings.' Review of Religious Research. 50:3 261-276.	Review of Religious Research	2009	0	The intertwining of state and religion in Israel bestows substantial authority to the autonomous Jewish, Muslim, and Christian communities. In that respect, citizens enjoy freedom of religion. But the relationship between state and religion also leads to the imposition of religious law on community, members even if they are not personally religious. Among Jews, who comprise 80\% of the population, this has led to friction between those who are religiously observant and those who are not, as the latter complain about the lack of freedom from religion. We study ten Jewish couples who make wedding plans that cross a threshold of protest over the religious status quo by choosing a non-government recognized alternative service rather than the mandatory state sanctioned Orthodox religious ceremony. Data from interviews with these persons and with five additional nonreligious couples who wed through the state rabbinate indicate that the conflict focuses mostly on the Orthodox rabbinical establishmen, perceived as rigid and inflexible. Generally, nonreligious Israelis conform to social norms and conduct their wedding ceremonies in a traditional Jewish manner that is seen to be bound up with their identities as Israelis. Nonreligious Israelis who marry outside of the State Rabbinate reject the state Orthodox religious establishment more than they reject religion.	2	Ephraim Tabory; Sharon Shalev Levtzur

Review of Religious Research	2009	2	The study of religious socialization and identity formation has seen a convergence between developmentalists and sociologists, where a line of inquiry, explored by Smith and Sikkink emphasizing the effect of socialization and identity formation on religious outcomes finds a correspondence to Marcia's typology based on commitment and exploration. The Second Wave of the National Study of Youth and Religion was used to test for the effects of parenting styles and youth autonomy on. religious outcomes. Measures of parental socialization and youth identity formation were developed from panel study data and tested using ordered logit regression. Youth in high tension religions were found to show more religious commitment while parental constraints and solidarity with parents were found to be insignificantly associated with religious outcomes. Several directions for future research on the socialization of adolescents by their parents are discussed.	1	Stephen Armet
Roemer, Michael. 2009. 'Religious Affiliation in Contemporary Japan: Untangling the Enigma.' Review of Religious Research. 50:3 298-320.	Review of Religious Research	2009	5	In Japan, quantitative accounts of religious membership range from more than one and a half times the total population to thirty percent or less, and we do not have a solid understanding of who these religious affiliates are. This paper addresses four core questions to provide a clearer portrayal of Japanese religious affiliation: 1) What is the approximate number of Japanese who claim religious affiliation? 2) How do the figures presented in this study differ from previous statistics and why? 3) Are there significant differences between individual affiliates and those who claim to have a ``household'' religion? And 4) What are some of the theoretical explanations for religious affiliation in Japan? Using data from large nationally representative probability samples of Japanese adults, multivariate analysis indicates that some deprivation measures (e.g., unemployment and low education and income levels) help explain individual affiliation with ``New Religions'' but not with Buddhist or Christian groups, and socialization controls (e.g., gender age, social engagement, and traditional attitudes) can predict belief in Buddhist, New Religion, and Christian religions. Insufficient data have hindered research on this important topic in the past. This study takes advantage of new resources and supports findings from qualitative research, enabling us to explore who are religious affiliates in Japan and why they might claim such associations.	1	Michael Roemer
Dougherty, Kevin, Christopher Bader, Paul Froese, Edward Poison & Buster Smith. 2009. 'Religious Diversity in a Conservative Baptist Congregation.' Review of Religious Research. 50:3 321-334.	Review of Religious Research	2009	3	One of the important goals of congregational research is to examine shared religious characteristics at the organizational level. Yet, data collection using key informants and limited questions concerning belief on congregational surveys can potentially mask significant religious diversity within congregations. Using detailed belief and attitude questions from an abridged version of the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey, we find noteworthy religious and theological variation among the most active adherents of a conservative Southern Baptist church in Central Texas. Unsurprisingly, congregants show broad agreement on belief in God and the importance of religious practices such as attending church and prayer; however; members of this tighty-knit group voice disagreement about their religious identity, conceptions of God, beliefs about heaven, and beliefs about the New Age. Our findings indicate the need for careful attention to these sources of diversity, which may prove consequential to the methods and theory of future congregational research.	5	Kevin D.

Review of Religious Research	2009	1	The religiosity of the young is rapidly changing even in a relatively ``small'' and ``protected'' context such as the Valley of Aosta, the smallest Italian region, situated in a mountainous area at the foot of Mont Blanc. In this context, characterized by social and cultural belonging to traditional Catholicism up to not many decades ago, a survey has been conducted among some 4,000 adolescents between the ages of 14 and 19. Beside the aspects of belief participation, and religious experience, other aspects were also investigated, especially the role of religion in a more and more pluralistic and globalized context. The results show how young people's reference to Catholicism is being deeply modified, with a more personal and free approach to rites and beliefs, and with a new opening towards other religions. Such changes indicate a new modality of relating to the sacred, varying by age, sex, and educational level.	1	Giuseppe Giordan

Review of Religious Research	2009	2	The purpose of this paper is to explore in detail how family religious rituals influence the life of Latter-day Saint individuals and families. It includes qualitative analysis of interviews with highly religious parents and children in 67 families that belong to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. While several challenges of religious rituals were mentioned, no negative influences of religious rituals were reported by this sample. Individual benefits of religious rituals included greater spiritual growth, happier daily life, more focus and direction, and better personal behavior Familial benefits of religious rituals included strengthened relationships, more family, togetherness and unity, increased communication, less contention and more kindness, better parenting. This research focuses on proximal measures of daily religious rituals in an attempt to produce a more complete picture of the meaning and role religion places in family life. As similar research is conducted utililzing samples of different denominations and cultures, a more complete depiction of the interface between religion and family life will be produced. Information derived from this research could be helpful for social scientists, therapists, clergy, and outreach professionals, Limitations are discussed.	4	Rachel W. Loser; E.

Gilbert, Jess. 2009. 'Democratizing States and the Use of History.' Rural Sociology. 74:1 3-24.	Rural Sociology	2009	4	A pervasive anti-statism often blinds us to the democratic victories in the past and thus to possibilities in our future. This article argues that big government can democratize society and uses historical investigation to make the point. The Study of history emancipates its from the tyranny of the present. Progressive social change has come about in the United States and elsewhere as combined bottom-up, top-down initiatives. I present two such cases of democratization during the New Deal era. The first is about rural sociologists' participatory-action research with local citizens for policy planning. This program, while short-lived, fed into the creation of the field of community development. The other is a land-reform experiment among poor African Americans. In the 1960s these ``resettlement communities'' became local strongholds of the civil-rights movement, and their descendants carry on the Struggle today. I use these two historical instances to show that big states as well as social scientists have been effective agents of democracy, and suggest that they can be again. History then enable us to reimagine, re-new, and re-form our democratic tradition of rural sociology.	1	Jess Gilbert
Jackson-Smith, Douglas & Eric Jensen. 2009. 'Finding Farms: Comparing Indicators of Farming Dependence and Agricultural Importance in the United States.' Rural Sociology. 74:1 37-55.	Rural Sociology	2009	1	Many scholars have commented on the changing significance of farming for understanding the dynamics of social and economic change in contemporary rural America. Quantitative analyses of relationship between farming, local socioeconomic conditions, demographic trends, and policy have often relied on an indicator of ``farm-dependent'' (FD) counties developed by the USDA Economic Research Service. In this article, we argue that measures of economic dependency imperfectly identify the places in the United States where farming is significant, and can paint an incomplete picture of the contemporary geographic distribution and structure of agriculture in the United States. We propose an alternative categorical indicator-agricultural importance (AI)-that provides a better direct measure of the relative size and intensity of farming across diverse U.S. counties. We compare the characteristics of FD and AI counties along a set of dimensions and discuss the strength and weakness of each typology.	2	Douglas B. Jackson-Smith; Eric Jensen

We also consider the significance of rural recreational behaviors in relation to agro-environmental concern. The analysis, based on data from a statewide survey of Ohioans, reveals a strong relationship between one's geographic location along the rural-urban continuum and attitudes about agriculture and the environment. This relationship, though, does not exist once the effects of social proximity to agriculture are accounted for, suggesting that the relationship between residential location along the rural-urban continuum and agro-environmental attitudes may be Spurious. The analysis also reveals a Strong relationship between participation in rural recreation and attitudes about agriculture and the environment. We describe several conceptual and practical implications of this research for natural-resource management.	2	Jeff Sharp; Lazarus Adua

The second half of the article applies insights from that historical analysis to the biofuel craze currently underway. By employing a political-economy interpretation of the socioeconomic context combined with a path-dependency-informed analysis of the technological trajectories, the article reveals the social forces that structured the trends and outcomes in biofuel innovations across the two ears.	1	Michael S.

Rural Sociology. 74:1 113-137.	Rural Sociology	2009	2	The purpose of this research was to explore and explain the role housing plays in rural community vitality. Community vitality refers to economic strength and social well-being. In spring 2002 we collected primary interview data from informants in 134 small rural communities in nine north-central states and identified related secondary data front the U.S. census. We developed a structural-equation-path model, which supported a ``housing decision chain'' that influenced community vitality. Based on this research, local housing decisions do play an important role in community vitality. Strong local leaders use housing planning to secure funding to produce a change in the quantity of housing, which in turn positively influences community vitality. Housing inventory also mediated the effects of total population and percentage population change on community vitality, indicating that. housing supply is a fundamental ingredient in community-growth strategies. These findings support the conclusion that a combination of housing plans and strategies orchestrated by skilled, committed leadership strengthens rural communities. Heretofore the link between housing and community vitality has not been investigated; evidence-based data has been missing from the debate on viable rural community-development strategies.	9	Christine C.

They find that the two communities are more similar to each other in religiosity than they are to most other European states, but are more similar in formal and personal religiosity to their opposite mainland counterparts. Religion, education, age and political orientation are major indicators of intolerance. The effects of religion, personal and formal religiosity and political orientation are reversed or mediated by the community, providing insight for European Union and Cypriot policy-makers.	3	Birol Yesilada; Peter Noordijk; Craig Webster

Social Compass	2009	1	British colonialism in Cyprus marked a new phase in church-state relations. During the Ottoman period, senior clergy fulfilled administrative and political positions, thereby fusing religious functions and secular administrative tasks. After 1856, the hierarchs received additional institutional recognition of their political authority. For the post-1878 British administration, church and state were conceived as separate institutions, thereby leading to the collapse of the prelates' political authority. The British refused to accept the Church's traditional regime of land ownership and property and excluded ecclesiastical taxes from state taxation. The authors trace the long-term implications of this redrawing of church-state boundaries for the Church of Cyprus. After the post-1878 de-legitimization of their authority, the church hierarchs reasserted their position by standing for election to the local legislative council and gaining a voice in the new system as popular representatives. Religious rhetoric adopted the markings of contemporary nationalism, turning the hierarchs into privileged representatives of an ethno-national group. This ultimately gave rise to the ethnarchy that characterized 20th-century Greek-Cypriot society.	2	Victor Roudometof; Michalis N. Michael
Yesilada, Birol. 2009. 'Islam and the Turkish Cypriots.' Social Compass. 56:1 49-59.	Social Compass	2009	0	Turkish Cypriots represent some of the most secular Muslims in the world. While they consider themselves as part of the Hanefi school of Sunni Islam and hold strong belief in God, most do not follow a lifestyle that reflects the characteristics of their ethnic compatriots in Turkey. Turkish Cypriots do not seem to be influenced by organized religion, rarely attend mosques, and adhere to a very strict form of secularism (laiklik). The author provides a brief overview of Turkish Cypriots' background and examines their religious values based on the results of the 2006 World Values Survey conducted in Cyprus. The findings show that while almost all of the Turkish Cypriots believe in importance of God in their lives and consider themselves as moderately religious individuals, very few attend regular mosque service. Furthermore, the majority do not believe that religious institutions provide answers to problems individuals face in their personal or societal realms. This rather complex attitude towards religion among Turkish Cypriots raises important questions concerning their cultural background that seem clearly to set them apart from most Turks elsewhere and support the argument that a sizable number of the Turkish Cypriot community are either descendents of Alevi settlers from Anatolia or Bektasi Janissaries, who held religious values that are different from those of their Sunni Ottoman relatives.	1	Birol Yesilada
Roudometof, Victor. 2009. 'Orthodox Christianity Within the Republic of Cyprus: Institutional Development and Religious Attitudes.' Social Compass. 56:1 60-68.	Social Compass	2009	0	Since the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus ( 1960) and the post-1974 division of the island into Greek and Turkish parts, social change and modernization have effectively transformed the Greek-Cypriot part of the island into a modern urban society. The author offers a brief overview of the institutional developments within the Orthodox Church of Cyprus in the post-1960 period and argues that in the aftermath of the passing of the legendary Archbishop Makarios III ( 1977), the original conception of the Cypriot ethnarchy has been effectively abandoned. In contrast to the one-man rule of this institution, the post-1960 institutional developments suggest the gradual assertion of synodical system within the Church of Cyprus. Additionally, the post-1960 modernization wave appears to have caused the bifurcation of the public between a more mainstream and a more conservative ( religiously austere) part.	1	Victor Roudometof
Dietzel, Irene & Vasilios Makrides. 2009. 'Ethno-religious Coexistence and Plurality in Cyprus Under British Rule (1878-1960).' Social Compass. 56:1 69-83.	Social Compass	2009	0	The island of Cyprus is, historically speaking, quite diverse and plural in religious terms. Due to its strategic geographical position in the Eastern Mediterranean and its occupation by several rulers, it is not accidental that various ethno-religious communities (Byzantine and Greek Orthodox, Maronites, Roman Catholics, Muslims, Armenians, Anglicans, Jews) settled at various periods in Cyprus and sometimes acquired firm footholds. This very fact poses the question about their coexistence with the dominant religious institution of the island, namely the Orthodox Church. The authors will assess this issue while specifically taking into consideration the situation under British rule. They look first at the plural religious field in Cyprus and its maintenance, drawing on theoretical as well as historical sources. Second, they focus on the multifaceted factors that substantially affected religious coexistence and tolerance under British rule, including the development of a religiously motivated nationalism among Greek Cypriots. Finally, they explore the role of the Orthodox Church as a factor in both peace and conflict during this period, and its relationship to the religious and cultural plurality on the island.	2	Irene Dietzel; Vasilios N.

Akyuz, Niyazi. 2009. 'Past and Future of the Sociology of Religion in Turkey.' Social Compass. 56:1 84-97.	Social Compass	2009	0	Interest in the sociology of religion in Turkey began with the translation of major sociology of religion works from Western culture and with the articles and writings of Ziya Gokalp, Selahaddin Asim, Necmeddin Sadak and H. Ziya Ulken. Until the mid-20th century, this interest continued through translations, articles and writings. In 1949, a sociology of religion department was established in the Faculty of Divinity in Ankara University, and began to work in a way consistent with the Western approach to the sociology of religion. Currently, there are twenty-three sociology of religion departments in various divinity faculties across the country. This field continues the develop through increasing scientific research. Turkish sociologists of religion are seeking wider communication and publication, and to share discussion platforms.	1	Niyazi Akyuz
Kochuyt, Thierry. 2009. 'God, Gifts and Poor People: on Charity in Islam.' Social Compass. 56:1 98-116.	Social Compass	2009	4	Islam asks the faithful to help the poor. Outlining the ideal type of this religious charity-known as the zakat-the author will analyse these alms as gifts. After identifying those who contribute and those who are eligible, he moves on to the beneficial effects of this solidarity. To assess the social mechanisms by which the community of faith is being built, the author refers throughout the article to the writings of Mauss, Sahlins and Bourdieu as regards gift giving and reciprocity. This analytical input permits him eventually to develop a triadic model of religiously-inspired charity that includes the divine protagonist who asks us to be generous.	1	Thierry Kochuyt
Crnic, Ales. 2009. 'Cult Versus Church Religiosity: Comparative Study of Hare Krishna Devotees and Catholics in Slovenia.' Social Compass. 56:1 117-135.	Social Compass	2009	0	The leading question addressed by the author is whether there are any notable differences between religiosity performed either within cults or within Churches (as ideal types of religious organizations). To find an answer, the author compares the religious practices (and their influence on everyday life of believers) of Slovene adherents of the Hare Krishna movement and Catholics. He presents the results of the systematic case study research into the Hare Krishna movement in Slovenia, and compares them with some results of international surveys (Aufbruch, 1997 and ISSP, 1998). The findings prove that Krishna adherents are considerably more active in their religious activities than Catholics and quite orthodox when it comes to the application of religious rules to everyday life. The differences are sufficient to allow the possibility of distinguishing between two distinctive types of religiosity. But counter to the general conviction this leads neither to noticeable exclusiveness on the part of the Krishna community and its isolation from society, nor to extreme conservatism among its members.	1	Ales Crnic

Social Forces	2009	9	Despite their longstanding interest in race, American sociologists have conducted little empirical research on sociodemographic patterns or longitudinal trends in ``racial conceptualization''-that is, notions of what race is, how races differ, and the origins of race. This article outlines key empirical, methodological and theoretical considerations for a research agenda on racial conceptualization. Drawing on in-depth interviews with more than 50 college students, I describe the variety of race concepts among respondents, illustrate the importance of using multiple measures of conceptualization, and demonstrate the malleability of conceptualization, linking it to demographic context and thereby raising the question of its future evolution in the changing United States of the 21(st) century.	1	Ann Morning
Kitts, James. 2009. 'Paradise Lost: Age-dependent Mortality of American Communes, 1609-1965.' Social Forces. 87:3 1193-1222.	Social Forces	2009	4	Theorists agree that the risk of folding changes as organizations age, but there is little consensus as to the general form or generative processes of age-dependent mortality. This article investigates four such processes (maturation, senescence, legitimation and obsolescence), which have been taken as competing accounts. Using two analytical levers-elaborating on the time shapes of these processes and distinguishing aging of organizations from aging of their templates (designs)-this paper differentiates these four processes and tests them jointly. Analysis of mortality rates for American communes from 1609 through 1965 strongly supports the proposed effects of maturation and senescence at the organization level and legitimation at the level of organizational templates. Results give weaker evidence that obsolescence of templates influenced mortality and that environmental drift exacerbated obsolescence.	1	James A. Kitts

Social Forces	2009	14	The theory of relative deprivation emphasizes that social comparisons contextualize how people experience impoverishment. An important application of this theory argues that relative deprivation that stems from unfavorable social comparisons can result in anger, normlessness and an increased likelihood of deviant behavior. We test this theory in a new societal setting-Iceland. Specifically, we test the proposition that the effects of economic deprivation on individual outcomes are contingent on: the standard of living enjoyed by the person's reference groups: Using multilevel data on 5,491 Icelandic adolescents in 83 school-communities, we find consistent support for the theory. We show that the effects of economic deprivation on adolescent anger, normlessness, delinquency, violence and subjective relative family status are weak in school-communities where economic deprivation is common, while the effects are significantly stronger in school-communities where economic deprivation is rare.	3	Jon Gunnar Bernburg; Thorolfur Thorlindsson; Inga Dora Sigfusdottir

In addition, we find a strong association between having a spouse and peer group that are non-religious and claiming no religion.	2	Joseph O. Baker; Buster G. Smith

Social Forces	2009	4	School sector and educational context seem to make a difference in civic socialization. There is limited knowledge, however, of the mechanisms through which socialization may occur in public and private schools, and the extent to which they have any lasting effect. Does the private school effect on civic socialization persist into young adulthood, and if it does, what explains the effect? Analyzing data from NELS:88 using HLM, the results of this study show that, net of background controls, there is a private school effect on civic participation in young adulthood, but it is mediated through contextual factors in the family and school-such as parent-school involvement, intergenerational closure, student-teacher relationships and prior participation that seem to account for the effect on adult civic behavior.	1	Jeffrey S.

Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Child Sample, we examined the relationship between birth weight and subsequent academic achievement growth disparities, distinguishing between birth weight and other contextual social confounders. We found that smaller birth weight is associated with lower math and reading scores at age 5. Additional findings indicated that the home environment has important developmental consequences from early childhood and into adolescence. Overall, the pattern of findings painted a complex picture of disadvantage, beginning in the womb and extending through a variety of mechanisms into adolescence.	2	Bridget J. Goosby; Jacob E.

Social Forces	2009	23	Using an event history framework we analyze the adoption rate of national human rights institutions. Neo-realist perspective predicts adoption rates to be positively influenced by favorable national profiles that lower the costs and make it more reasonable to establish these institutions. From a world polity perspective adoption rates will be positively influenced by a world saturated with human rights organizations and conferences, by increasing adoption densities, and by greater linkages to the world polity. We find support for both perspectives in the analysis of the human rights commission. Only the changing state of the world polity is consequential for the founding of the classical ombudsman office. We discuss the national incorporation of international human rights standards and its relevance to issues of state sovereignty and national citizenship.	2	Jeong-Woo Koo; Francisco O. Ramirez

Established contextual theories do not formulate propositions on how context affects individual protesters. The article engages in empirically testing whether the macro-context affects the internal diversity of the crowds that took to the streets on Feb. 15 2003, the massive day of protest against the upcoming war or; Iraq. Drawing on a survey of 6,753 individual demonstrators in eight countries, we find that the composition of the marches is determined by the stance of the government and the opposition in the countries at stake. Apart from government stance, also the support in public opinion and the type of mobilization (media support) matter for internal diversity.	2	Stefaan Walgrave; Joris Verhulst
Tsutsui, Kiyoteru. 2009. 'the Trajectory of Perpetrators' Trauma: Mnemonic Politics Around the Asia-pacific War in Japan.' Social Forces. 87:3 1389-1422.	Social Forces	2009	4	This study proposes a theoretical framework to understand how nations deal with collective memories of perpetration of severe human rights violations, which do not fit comfortably in any national master narrative but have become increasingly difficult to ignore. Building on studies of collective memory, the framework explicates how initial historical conditions of the nation, domestic social movements, and the degree of international pressures move the national discourse along two key dimensions-(1. acceptance of guilt and (2. international orientation of the discourse-which map out seven possible responses to collective trauma of perpetration. Through examination of the history of post-war Japan and content analyses of newspaper editorials and prime ministers' speeches from 1945 through 2004, the empirical analysis applies the framework to the Japanese case. The analysis reveals that arguments for apologies to Asian victims have gained ground due to the intensification of domestic social movements, international pressures from neighboring countries, and global human rights influence. It also shows that arguments that evade the ugly past have persisted because of the initial conditions immediately after 1945, overwhelming emphasis on Japanese victims in the ensuing decades, and recent appropriation of human rights language by proponents of the defensive arguments.	1	Kiyoteru Tsutsui
Stamatel, Janet. 2009. 'Correlates of National-level Homicide Variation in Post-communist East-central Europe.' Social Forces. 87:3 1423-1448.	Social Forces	2009	14	This article examines whether correlates Of cross-national homicide variation tested with data from highly developed, predominantly Western nations could also explain homicide rates in East-Central Europe. Using pooled time-series analyses of data from nine countries from 1990 through 2003, this study found that homicide rates were negatively related to GDP/capita and positively related to ethnic diversity and population density. They were also negatively related to the percentage of young people and not significantly related to income inequality or divorce rates. This article also investigates whether conditions specific to the post-communist transformations contributed to homicide variation. Findings indicate that progressive reforms toward democratization and marketization decreased homicide rates. The discussion uses the socio-historical context of the nations to explain-these results.	1	Janet P. Stamatel

Social Forces	2009	0	We employ newly developed methods to disentangle age, period and cohort effects on non-marital fertility ratios from 1972 through 2002 for black and white women ages 20-44 in the United States. We focus on three cohort factors: family structure, school enrollment and the sex ratio. For both blacks and whites, cohorts with less traditional family structures have higher NFRs. Other results differ by race. The impact of school enrollment on NFRs is significantly negative for whites, but significantly positive for blacks. The impact of sex ratio is significantly negative for blacks, but insignificant for whites. If black women and white women had cohort characteristics typical of the other group, age specific NFRs for black women would decline markedly, while those for whites would increase markedly.	4	Jean Stockard; Jo Anna Gray; Robert O'Brien; Joe Stone

Social Forces	2009	8	This article examines the influence of resource dependence and institutional processes on post-Civil Rights Act changes in private sector workplace segregation. We use data collected by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission from 1966 through 2000 to examine organizations embedded within their firm, industry, local labor market and federal regulatory environments. Sex segregation declines precipitously from 1966 through 2000, but we see little evidence that organizations in the same industrial environment have established a stable pattern of segregation and integration. In other words, sex segregation has not been institutionalized. Race segregation, on the other hand, shows strong and increasing evidence of institutionalization, but weak declines after 1980. Firm visibility, field concentration and federal contractor density, but not direct federal affirmative action reporting, prove to be particularly important for understanding changes in segregation levels and institutionalization within industries. Results point to the importance of organizational fields and labor queues for motivating both persistence and change in workplace inequality.	3	Tricia McTague; Kevin Stainback; Donald Tomaskovic-Devey
Moller, Stephanie & Huiping Li. 2009. 'Parties, Unions, Policies and Occupational Sex Segregation in the United States.' Social Forces. 87:3 1529-1560.	Social Forces	2009	2	We utilize the 2000 Equal Employment Opportunity file of the US. Census and various secondary resources to determine if party control, union density and states' anti-discrimination and family leave policy legacies affect levels of occupational sex segregation across large counties. Our findings offer a puzzle to political sociologists because two theories that are typically pitted against one another (Power Resource Theory vs. Liberal Economic Theory) predict and result in comparable outcomes. Indeed, as suggested by Social Democratic Theory, the sub-national United States have lower levels of occupational sex segregation when the Democratic Party and unions are strong, and policies are the mechanism through which these states maintain low occupational sex segregation. Yet, interestingly, as suggested by Liberal Economic Theory, occupational sex segregation is also low when unions and the Democratic Party are both weak, suggesting that unfettered market capitalism redresses socio-economic inequalities.	2	Stephanie Moller; Huiping Li
Roscigno, Vincent, Steven Lopez & Randy Hodson. 2009. 'Supervisory Bullying, Status Inequalities and Organizational Context.' Social Forces. 87:3 1561-1589.	Social Forces	2009	18	Bullying has been increasingly identified as a significant social problem. Although much of this attention has centered on the context Of schooling, researchers are now beginning to recognize that workplaces are also arenas rife with abusive, bullying behaviors. Personality attributes of bullies and victims have received attention, but much less research has examined the social and organizational foundations of bullying. In this article, we focus theoretical attention on the importance of status-based power differentials and organizational context for the emergence of supervisory bullying in employment. Our multi-method analyses, which draw from content-coded organizational ethnographies (N=204), highlight the importance not only of structural and social vulnerability-such as being in a racial minority or of a low occupational position-but also of chaotic and disorganized workplaces. Poor workplace organization, we show, creates positive motivations for supervisory bullying. Workplaces without capable guardians create further vulnerabilities to bullying as a managerial control tactic. We conclude by discussing the theoretical implications Of our results for understanding social power, organizational dynamics and the ramifications of abuse in the workplace.	3	Vincent J.

Wolfinger, Nicholas, Mary Mason & Marc Goulden. 2009. 'Stay in the Game: Gender, Family Formation and Alternative Trajectories in the Academic Life Course.' Social Forces. 87:3 1591-1621.	Social Forces	2009	10	Academic careers have traditionally been conceptualized as pipelines, through which young scholars move seamlessly from graduate school to tenure-track positions. This model often fails to capture the experiences of female Ph.D. recipients, who become tenure-track assistant professors at lower rates than do their male counterparts. What do these women do instead? We use panel data from the 1983-1995 Surveys of Doctorate Recipients to explore the early careers of Ph.D. recipients. Our results show that female doctorate recipients are disproportionately likely to be employed as adjunct faculty or exit the paid labor force, especially if they have young children. Contrary to conventional wisdom, adjunct professorships provide a better opportunity forgetting a tenure-track job down the road than do non-teaching positions inside or outside of academia. Collectively these findings show that the academic life course is both complex and permeable.	3	Nicholas H. Wolfinger; Mary Ann Mason; Marc Goulden
Hysom, Stuart. 2009. 'Status Valued Goal Objects and Performance Expectations.' Social Forces. 87:3 1623-1648.	Social Forces	2009	2	I designed an experiment to test predictions, derived from expectation states theories, that the unequal allocation Of social rewards among collective task-focused actors will affect the actors' rates of power and prestige behavior. Past research shows that allocations Of exchangeable resources can have these effects. The prediction, however, is general and applies to groups where distributed rewards possess only status value. Consistent with predictions, participants who received a fictitious title and a special certificate inviting them to attend an ``exclusive private reception'' as an honored guest resisted influence more and evaluated themselves as more capable compared to participants whose partners received the title, certificate and invitation. I discuss implications of this research for status construction theories, which invoke the processes I examine to describe how new status characteristics could emerge in a society.	1	Stuart J. Hysom
Achterberg, Peter & Dick Houtman. 2009. 'Ideologically Illogical? Why Do the Lower-educated Dutch Display So Little Value Coherence?.' Social Forces. 87:3 1649-1670.	Social Forces	2009	11	In studies of mass ideology, it is often found that political values are ordered two-dimensionally among the public at large. In a first economic dimension, equality is contested; in a second cultural one, individual freedom is contested. While this general rule of two-dimensionality applies to the public at large, there are large differences between educational categories. While two-dimensionality is found for the lower educated, the higher educated order their values along a single dimension and hence show more value coherence. Using a recent Dutch national survey, we show that these differences between the higher and the lower educated cannot be explained by differences in political competence. Instead, a combination Of cultural and economic insecurity is responsible for the lower levels of value coherence among the lower educated.	2	Peter Achterberg; Dick Houtman
Lee, Matthew & Edward Shihadeh. 2009. 'the Spatial Concentration of Southern Whites and Argument-based Lethal Violence.' Social Forces. 87:3 1671-1694.	Social Forces	2009	3	This analysis examines how the spatial concentration of Southern whites is associated with white argument-based lethal violence. Using a well-known measure of spatial segregation (V, the adjusted P* index) among Southern-born whites in US. counties in 2000, the results reveal that the spatial concentration of Southern-born whites is only moderately correlated with their overall representation within counties. This confirms that the quantity of Southerners in an area is not the same thing as their spatial distribution within that same area. Multivariate negative binomial regression models confirm that white argument homicide rates are higher where white Southerners are more spatially concentrated, a link that is confined to Southern counties. The findings illustrate the important role spatial arrangements may play in producing expressive violence among white Southerners.	2	Matthew R. Lee; Edward S. Shihadeh
Huber, Evelyne, John Stephens, David Bradley, Stephanie Moller & Francois Nielsen. 2009. 'the Politics of Women's Economic Independence.' Social Politics. 16:1 1-39.	Social Politics	2009	9	We identify the political conditions that shape the economic position of married/cohabiting women and of the economically most vulnerable group of women-025EFsingle mothers. Specifically, we examine the determinants of reductions in single mothers' poverty rate due to taxes and transfers, and women's wages relative to spouses'/ partners' wages. The Luxembourg Income Study archive yields an unbalanced panel with 71 observations on 15 countries. The principal determinants of poverty reduction due to taxes and transfers are left government, constitutional veto points, and welfare generosity. The relative wage of women in couples is a function mainly of female labor force participation, part time work among women, and women's mobilization. In explaining the causal pathways to these outcomes, we highlight the interrelationships of welfare state, care, and labor market policies.	5	Evelyne Huber; John D.

Bolzendahl, Catherine. 2009. 'Making the Implicit Explicit: Gender Influences on Social Spending in Twelve Industrialized Democracies, 1980-99.' Social Politics. 16:1 40-81.	Social Politics	2009	4	Despite the theoretical relevance of gender influences and a body of gender and feminist literature demonstrating the importance of changing gender relations on social policy, quantitative analyses have been slow to incorporate their impact. Thus, little is known about the importance of gender-specific measures in comparison to more established influences, or about the relative impact of the differing potential gendered pressures themselves. To address this gap, I theorize gender-relevant measures in economic, family, and political arenas, and appraise them alongside established influences. Though influences from each sphere emerge as consequential, the effects are not equal. Results across twenty years and twelve industrialized democracies show that women's legislative presence has the strongest overall effect, but spending outcomes are the most generous when all gender influences work in conjunction. Implications of these results for extending welfare state theory and research are discussed.	1	Catherine Bolzendahl
Webb, Janette. 2009. 'Gender and Occupation in Market Economies: Change and Restructuring Since the 1980s.' Social Politics. 16:1 82-110.	Social Politics	2009	5	This paper compares employment restructuring, gender, and occupational change in Japan, Sweden, the UK, and the USA, since the 1980s. Its analytical framework is derived from feminist debates about the relative influence of political-economic skill regimes and cultural ideologies of gender on occupational sex segregation. In each country, the shift towards services has further concentrated men's dominance of employment in extractive and transformative industries. Pre-existing patterns of occupational segregation between the sexes have not however been universally reinforced. A degree of occupational upgrading has facilitated women's movement into a growing range of professional and managerial occupations, but the extent of economic opportunity for women is not a simple function of labor market economics. The social-democratic, egalitarian values and policies of Sweden, for example, seem to have offered greater economic benefits to women than the more individualized, liberalized labor market policies of the UK. In conclusion, it is argued that gender and markets are mutually constitutive; their evolution is not pre-given but subject to political choices informed by history and culture.	1	Janette Webb

Social Politics	2009	0	Work-life balance (WLB) is an emblematic strategy to achieve well-being for Third Way governments around the world and an exercise in nurturing self-actualizing and entrepreneurial citizens. By reading a case study of New Zealand's Labour WLB project through a poststructuralist perspective, I demonstrate that Third Way WLB policy projects are technical exercises in ethicalization. These practices serve to de-contextualize and de-politicize the terrain of well-being. This analysis highlights a contradiction in Third Way agendas to address the well-being of the needy because they disempower those they seek to empower.	1	Ruth McManus
Elizabeth, Vivienne & Wendy Larner. 2009. 'Racializing the ``social Development'' State: Investing in Children in Aotearoa/new Zealand.' Social Politics. 16:1 132-158.	Social Politics	2009	4	This paper focuses on the claim that the child is emerging as a key figure of social governance. International studies suggest that as liberal welfare states increasingly draw on social investment discourse, the child-025EFparticularly the child-as-worker-in-becoming-025EFhas emerged as an iconic figure. This has resulted in the child becoming the central subject of social policies and programs and the focus of new spending priorities. In Aotearoa/New Zealand, however, the figure of the child is much less prominent than elsewhere. Moreover, in the policies and programs of the New Zealand ``social development'' state, the child is often racialized by virtue of its location within specific family groupings and geographical communities. In turn, this has implications for the positioning of women. As we show, the child/mother who stands to benefit from the ``investments'' of social development in Aotearoa/New Zealand is actually more likely to be a P (A) over bar keh (A) over bar child/mother, whereas the child/mother requiring continued programmatic intervention is more likely to be M (A) over bar ori or Pacific. This finding points to the need for feminist scholars to examine further the complex interpenetration of gender and race/ethnicity in the shaping of contemporary socio-political landscapes.	2	Vivienne Elizabeth; Wendy Larner

Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	0	The contact hypothesis (Allport 1954) predicts that cross-racial interaction can produce social bonding under certain status, relational, and institutional conditions. We extend this classic theory on ingroups and outgroups using qualitative data on Cambodian and Hmong refugees' recollections of casual conversations about ancestry with black and white peers. To cope with affective trauma, these refugees have created personal narratives about forced emigration. They believe that white peers shared stories about immigrant ancestors from Europe to affirm or elicit their emigration narrative. The re gees rarely believe that black peers' talk about slavery and discrimination was a story-sharing gesture and felt uncomfortable discussing these issues. Yet the refugees also feel disappointed when recalling interactions with assimilated white peers who ``don't have a story to tell'' about ancestry From these inductive findings, this article proposes the corollary discourse hypothesis to explain how sentiments about intergroup narration, and not just frequency of contact, amplify or diminish empathy and association in a heterogeneous society	2	Jeremy Hein; Christopher D.

Social Psychology Quarterly. 72:1 24-38.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	30	In this study, we examined the relationship between national identification and anti-immigrant prejudice in a multilevel analysis of ISSP survey data from 3 7,030 individuals in 31 countries. We argue that this relationship depends on how national groups are defined by their members. Across the 31 national samples, the correlation between national identification and prejudice ranged from weakly negative (-.06) to moderately positive (.37). The relationship was significantly stronger in countries where people on average endorsed a definition of national belonging based on language, and weaker where people on average defined the nation in terms of citizenship. These effects occurred at a national rather than individual level, supporting an explanation in terms of the construction of nationality that prevails in a given context, Endorsement of the ancestry-based criteria for nationality was positively associated with prejudice, but only at the individual level.	3	Samuel Pehrson; Vivian L.

Johnson, Monica & Stefanie Mollborn. 2009. 'Growing Up Faster, Feeling Older: Hardship in Childhood and Adolescence.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 72:1 39-60.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	7	We examine whether hardship while growing up shapes subjective age identity, as well as three types of experiences through which it may occur. Drawing on data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find that hardship in several domains during childhood and adolescence is associated with feeling relatively older and self-identifying as an adult in the late teens and twenties. Specifically, Young people who as adolescents felt unsafe in their schools or neighborhoods, witnessed or were victims of violence, had fewer economic resources in the household, and lived in certain family structures, reported older subjective ages (by one or both measures). We find no evidence that hardship's association with subjective age is mediated by work responsibilities in adolescence or by anticipating a very curtailed life span, but entering adult roles earlier mediates or partially mediates many of these relationships.	2	Monica Kirkpatrick Johnson; Stefanie Mollborn
Joyner, Kara. 2009. 'Justice and the Fate of Married and Cohabiting Couples.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 72:1 61-76.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	3	Are cohabiting couples more likely than married couples to break up in response to perceptions that their relationship is not fair? Based on social psychological perspectives oil intimate relationship stability, in addition to empirical research contrasting cohabitation with marriage, I hypothesize that cohabiting couples will be more likely than married couples to separate in response to perceived breaches of justice. To test this hypothesis and others, I examine the influence of both male and female partners' perceptions of fairness on the stability of married and cohabiting couples using two waves of couple-level data from the National Survey of Families and Households. The results of Cox proportional hazards models suggest that cohabiting couples, but not married couples, are increasingly likely to separate as levels of male or female underbenefiting increase. The conclusion discusses the implications of these findings,for social psychological perspectives and future studies on the role of distributive justice in the stability of intimate relationships.	1	Kara Joyner
Shostak, Sara, Jeremy Freese, Bruce Link & Jo Phelan. 2009. 'the Politics of the Gene: Social Status and Beliefs About Genetics for Individual Outcomes.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 72:1 77-93.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	11	Social scientists have predicted that individuals who occupy socially privileged positions or who have conservative political orientations are most likely to endorse the idea that genes are the root cause of differences among individuals. Drawing on a nationally representative sample of the US population, this study examines belief in the importance of genes for understanding individual differences in a series of broad domains: physical illness, serious mental illness, intelligence, personality, and success in life. We also assess whether the belief that genetics are important for these outcomes is more common among those in relatively advantaged positions or among those who are more politically conservative. Finally, we consider whether such beliefs predict attitudes toward genetics-related social policies. Our analyses suggest that belief in the importance of genetics for individual differences mat well have a substantial effect on attitudes toward genetics-related policies, independent of political orientation or other measures. Our study identifies high levels of endorsement for genes as causes of health and social outcomes. We describe a cultural schema in which outcomes that are ``closer to the body'' are more commonly attributed to genetics. Contrary to expectations, however, we find little evidence that it is more common for whites, the socioeconomically advantaged, or political conservatives to believe that genetics are important for health and social outcomes.	4	Sara Shostak; Jeremy Freese; Bruce G.

'Response Rate and Measurement Differences in Mixed-mode Surveys Using Mail, Telephone, Interactive Voice Response (ivr) and the Internet.' Social Science Research. 38:1 3-20.	Social Science Research	2009	67	The potential for improving response rates by changing from one mode of data collection to another mode and the consequences for measurement and nonresponse errors are examined. Data collection from 8999 households was done in two phases. Phase I data collection was conducted by telephone interview, mail, interactive voice response, or the Internet, while Phase 2 focused on nonrespondents to Phase 1, and was conducted by a different mode, either telephone or mail. Results from our study suggest that switching to a second mode is an effective means of improving response. We also find that for the satisfaction-dissatisfaction questions asked in this survey, respondents to the aural modes (telephone and IVR) are significantly more likely than are respondents to the visual modes (mail and web) to give extreme positive responses, a difference that cannot be accounted for by a tendency towards recency effects with telephone. In general, switching to a second mode of data collection was not an effective means of reducing nonresponse error based on demographics.	7	Don A.

Hargens, Lowell. 2009. 'Product-variable Models of Interaction Effects and Causal Mechanisms.' Social Science Research. 38:1 21-30.	Social Science Research	2009	1	Among those who use multiple regression or its offshoots, the dominant method of modeling an interaction effect of two independent variables oil a dependent variable is to include a product variable in a linear estimation equation. In this paper, I show how the coefficient for the product variable in these models depends on the causal mechanism that underlies the interaction effect. I also show that different causal mechanisms can imply the same estimation equation, which means that one cannot determine the causal mechanism underlying an interaction effect from the empirical results produced by the estimation equation. Social scientists typically lack the kind of theoretical knowledge required to specify Causal mechanisms for interaction effects, and researchers who do specify a mechanism, such as those who specify that contextual-level variables moderate the effects of individual-level variables but not vice versa, rarely justify their implicit claims. Although it is difficult to specify the causal mechanism underlying a particular interaction effect, I show that there are cases where it is possible to do so.	1	Lowell L. Hargens
Huang, Min-Hsiung. 2009. 'Race of the Interviewer and the Black-white Test Score Gap.' Social Science Research. 38:1 31-40.	Social Science Research	2009	4	Does the race of inter-viewers introduce a bias in estimating the test score gap between blacks and whites in the United States? To answer this question, I use an adult sample from the General Social Survey (GSS) in which vocabulary testing involves face-to-face and one-on-one interaction between the respondent and the interviewer, I find that black respondents perform better when tested by a black interviewer as opposed to a white interviewer. For white respondents, however, the race of the interviewer does not have a significant impact on test performance. Because most black respondents are tested by white interviewers in the GSS, the test performance of black respondents is downward biased, and the black-white test score gap is overestimated.	1	Min-Hsiung Huang
Feliciano, Cynthia, Belinda Robnett & Golnaz Komaie. 2009. 'Gendered Racial Exclusion Among White Internet Daters.' Social Science Research. 38:1 41-56.	Social Science Research	2009	12	Acceptance by the dominant group reveals the current standing of racial groups in the U.S. hierarchy, as well as the possibility for assimilation. However, few researchers have addressed the gendered nature of racial preferences by whites. We examine whites' exclusion of blacks, Latinos. Asians, Middle Easterners, East Indians and Native Americans as possible dates, using a sample of profiles collected from an internet dating website. We find that white men are more willing than white women to date non-whites in general, yet, with the exception of their top two preferences for dates, whites and Latinos, the racial hierarchies of males and females differ. Among daters with stated racial preferences, white men are more likely to exclude blacks as possible dates, while white women are more likely to exclude Asians. We argue that exclusion relates to racialized images of masculinity and femininity, and shapes dating and marriage outcomes, and thus minority groups' possibilities for full social incorporation.	3	Cynthia Feliciano; Belinda Robnett; Golnaz Komaie

Social Science Research	2009	19	We use newly developed methods of measuring spatial segregation across a range of spatial scales to assess changes in racial residential segregation patterns in the 100 largest U.S. metropolitan areas from 1990 to 2000. Our results point to three notable trends in segregation from 1990 to 2000: ( I) Hispanic-white and Asian-white segregation levels increased at both micro- and macro-scales; (2) black-white segregation declined at a micro-scale, but was unchanged at a macro-scale; and (3) for all three racial groups and for almost all metropolitan areas, macro-scale segregation accounted for more of the total metropolitan area segregation in 2000 than in 1990. Our examination of the variation in these trends among the metropolitan areas suggests that Hispanic-white and Asian-white segregation changes have been driven largely by increases in macro-scale segregation resulting from the rapid growth of the Hispanic and Asian populations in central cities. The changes in black-white segregation, in contrast, appear to be driven by the continuation of a 30-year trend in declining micro-segregation, coupled with persistent and largely stable patterns of macro-segregation.	6	Sean F.

Social Science Research	2009	11	Using evidence from Durham, North Carolina, we examine the impact of school choice programs on racial and class-based segregation across schools. Reasonable assumptions about the distribution of preferences over race, class, and school characteristics suggest that the segregating choices of students from advantaged backgrounds are likely to outweigh any integrating choices by disadvantaged students. The results of our empirical analysis are consistent with these theoretical considerations. Using information on the actual schools students attend and on the schools in their assigned attendance zones, we find that schools in Durham are more segregated by race and class as a result of school choice programs than they would be if all Students attended their geographically assigned schools. In addition, we find that the effects of choice on segregation by class are larger than the effects on segregation by race.	3	Robert Bifulco; Helen F. Ladd; Stephen L. Ross
Paxton, Pamela, Matthew Painter & Melanie Hughes. 2009. 'Year of the Woman, Decade of the Man: Trajectories of Growth in Women's State Legislative Representation.' Social Science Research. 38:1 88-104.	Social Science Research	2009	2	The expansion of women's political representation ranks among the most significant trends in American politics of the last 100 years. In this paper, we develop two longitudinal theories to explain patterns of growth and change in women's state legislative representation over time. Gender salience suggests that years in which women's absence from politics is problematized (e.g., 1992-the Year of the Woman) will demonstrate higher levels of growth. Political climate suggests that periods in which domestic issues are stressed (e.g., the 1990s) will produce higher levels of growth than periods in which international issues are stressed (e.g., post 9/11). Combinations of these two theories create four possible trajectories of growth in women's representation that may be observed over time. We use latent growth curve models to assess the four theoretical trajectories, using data on women's state legislative representation from 1982 to 2006. We find that while women achieved fleeting success in the Year of the Woman, further gains were limited in the remainder of the 1990s and average growth stalled completely after 2001. Our results show futher that gender salience and, to a lesser extent political, climate matter to growth and change in women's political power over time.	3	Pamela Paxton; Matthew A.

We examine the relationship between individual attributes, aggregate female labor force participation, child care enrollment, family leave, and individual fertility in 20 developed countries using a hierarchical Bayesian model. Our results indicate that women's full-time employment and country-level employment rates decrease expected fertility in contrast to recent research which shows a reversal in the negative association between total fertility rates and female labor force participation during the 1980s. However, the positive association between child care enrollment and fertility indicates that child care services might mitigate some of the decline in fertility, possibly by reducing labor force exit among women with young children.

Social Science Research	2009	7	Recent studies have sparked lively debates about White working class voting in the U.S. On one hand, there is evidence that the White working class has shifted to vote Republican, and on the other hand, there is evidence that the White working class continues to vote Democratic. Using the American National Elections Studies (ANES), we examine 32 years of presidential election results (1972-2004). We utilize theoretically justifiable measures of routine white collar, skilled and unskilled workers, which we then combine into broad and restricted measures of the White working class. Also, we distinguish between the male and female White working class and consider a variety of other predictors of vote choice. We scrutinize the entire period as a whole, each election year individually, and then concentrate on the 1996-2004 elections. In the entire period, the odds that White Working class men voted Republican were greater by a factor of about 1.35. By contrast, White working class women were not significantly different from the electorate. Yet, this conceals temporal variation. Although the White working class was more Republican than the general electorate in 1972 and 1984, and more Democratic in 1976, the White working class generally was consistent with the electorate through 1992. Since 1996, there has been a sharp divergence between the male and female White working class. Men very strongly supported Republicans 1996-2004, while there is some evidence women supported Democrats in 1996 and 2004 (but not 2000). From 1996-2004, the odds White working class men voted Republican were greater by a factor of about 2.0. These patterns are not confined to the South and hold despite controls for a variety of predictors of vote choice.	3	David Brady; Benjamin Sosnaud; Steven M. Frenk
Perrin, Andrew & Sondra Smolek. 2009. 'Who Trusts? Race, Gender, and the September 11 Rally Effect Among Young Adults.' Social Science Research. 38:1 136-147.	Social Science Research	2009	6	First proposed by Mueller, the theory of the ``rally effect'' predicts that public support for government officials will increase when an event occurs that (1) is international; (2) involves the United States; and (3) is specific, dramatic, and sharply focused [Mueller, J.E. 1973. War, Presidents, \& Public Opinion. New York: John Wiley \& Sons., p. 209]. Using the natural experiment of a large (N = 15,127) survey of young adults ages 18-27 that was in the field during the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, we confirm the existence of a rally effect on trust in government as well as its subsequent decay. We then use a predictive modeling approach to investigate individual-level dynamics of rallying around the flag and anti-rallying in the face of the national threat. By disaggregating predictors of rallying, we demonstrate remarkably different patterns of response to the attacks based on sex and, particularly, race. The results confirm expectations of national threat inciting a rally effect, but indicate that the dynamics of this rally effect are complex and race and gender-dependent. The article offers previously-unavailable insights into the dynamics of rallying and trust in government.	2	Andrew J. Perrin; Sondra J. Smolek

Social Science Research	2009	0	Strategic and tactical planning for military intervention needs revision as the causes, methods, and means of conflict have evolved. Counter-insurgent engagement is one such intervention that governments, militaries, and non-governmental organizations seek to better understand. Modeling insurgencies is an acceptable means to gain insight into the various characteristics of asymmetric warfare to proffer prescriptive resolutions for mitigating their effects. Colombia's insurgency poses the challenge of assessing population behavior in a non-traditional revolutionary climate. Factors prevalent in traditional insurgency are not applicable in Colombia, specifically between the years 1993 and 2001 with the democratization of the drug cartels. The catastrophic events of September 11th reverberated in Colombia resulting in a new policy and strategy to the waging the counter-insurgency there. This research introduces a structured methodology to modeling the Colombian counter-insurgency incorporating qualitative assessment, mathematical representation, and a System Dynamics approach to represent the effects of the policy change.	2	Catherine M.

Social Science Research	2009	10	What happens to family relations when an adolescent and her parent do not share the same religious convictions or practices? Whereas previous work on religion and intergenerational relations looks at relationships between parents and their adult children, we shift the focus to younger families, assessing how parent-child religious discord affects adolescents' evaluation of their relationship with their parents. Exploring data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we find several interesting patterns of association between religious discord and parent-child relations. Overall, religious discord predicts lower quality intergenerational relations. When parents value religion more than their teens do, adolescents tend to report poorer relations with parents. Relationship quality is not lower, however, when it is the adolescent who values religion more highly. We also find that religious discord is more aggravating in families where parent and child share religious affiliation and in families where the parent is an evangelical Protestant.	2	Charles E.

Lichter, Daniel & Julie Carmalt. 2009. 'Religion and Marital Quality Among Low-income Couples.' Social Science Research. 38:1 168-187.	Social Science Research	2009	18	In this paper, we examine the question of whether religion-affiliation, beliefs, and practice-provides a source Of Marital strength and stability in the lives of American couples. Unlike most previous studies, we focus on religion and marital quality among 433 low-income married couples with co-residential minor children, using recently collected survey data on both spouses sampled in the Marital and Relationship Survey (MARS). Our working hypothesis is that religiosity is a positive force for marital quality among low-income couples, and that a practicing faith can buffer the negative effects of economic stress on marital quality. The results indicate that most low-income couples have unexpectedly high scores on the various dimensions of marital quality (e.g., commitment, emotional support, etc.). Religious affiliation and personal religious beliefs are less important for marital quality than if couples share similar beliefs about God's divine plans for them and their relationship, if they pray together, or if they attend religious services together. On the other hand, the stress-buffering hypothesis received little support in our analysis. At a minimum, the results clearly highlight the potential role of religion in the marital lives of low-income couples. The implication is that faith-based organizations (including churches and synagogues) may have a particularly strong role to play in nurturing the spiritual lives and enhancing the quality of the intimate marital relationships of their flocks.	2	Daniel T.

This study examines the influence of the family of origin oil the development of kinship norms using models of sibling resemblance estimated on a large-scale multi-actor survey. Analyses show that a quarter of the variance in filial norms can be explained by the family of origin. The family of origin has a smaller influence on normative obligations toward children and other family. Part of the total family influence can be explained by the filial norms that parents have themselves and the emphasis parents put oil obedience. Family background characteristics are less important.	3	Jannes De; Matthiis Kalmijn; Aart C. Liefbroer

Social Science Research. 38:1 213-224.	Social Science Research	2009	13	Social context is increasingly recognized as essential for understanding complex human outcomes even among geneticists who focus on genetic influences. These outcomes typically involve multiple genes, multiple environmental factors, and the interactions between the two. In this paper, we propose a conceptual framework for gene-environment interaction and show how the interaction can be tested empirically using a sample of MZ twin, DZ twins, and full siblings. We test the hypothesis that the genetic contribution to adolescent drinking depends on the drinking behavior of their friends, using a sample of clusters of siblings and their friends from Add Health. Our analysis has yielded evidence supporting the gene-environment interaction hypothesis. High levels of alcohol use by one's best friend or among one's friends tend to bring about higher levels of genetic contribution to alcohol use. Lower levels of alcohol use by one's best friend or among one's friends tend to suppress the level of genetic contribution to alcohol use. Our findings suggest that friend behavior might be a particularly important environmental moderator of the expression of genetic disposition for adolescent drug use, smoking, dietary habits, and risky sexual behavior. Subsequent studies of these behaviors that use non-DNA twin samples or DNA measures of genetic variants should investigate peer influence as a significant environmental moderator.	4	Guang Guo; Glen H.

The analysis focuses on how organization-level characteristics Such as workforce composition within the establishment and flexible workplace practices are associated with within-establishment earnings inequality. The results suggest that gender heterogeneity, percentage of newly hired workers within the organization, and flexible workplace practices such as job rotation and self-managed teams are significantly associated with earnings dispersion within manufacturing establishments.	1	Taekjin Shin

Fixed effects regression results indicated that within country worldwide exports and United States exports are positively related to per capita Carbon dioxide emissions. However, when both exports to the World and to the U.S. are examined simultaneously, only exports to the U.S. are related to carbon dioxide emissions. Additional analysis Suggests that not all exports to the U.S. are responsible for the carbon-exports relationship. Specifically, the association between per capita carbon dioxide emissions and exports to the U.S. is largely the result of the oil and gas, petroleum and coal products, chemicals, and re-import industries. The data suggest consumption practices in the U.S. are partially responsible for elevated per capita carbon dioxide emissions in other nations, and that carbon dioxide trends in other nations are in part driven by U.S. demands for goods. These results also indicate that inefficient production methods among countries that export products to the United States may signal a problematic trend in global carbon dioxide emissions.	2	Paul B.

Sociological Forum	2009	7	The structural theory of ecologically unequal exchange posits that through the vertical flow of exports from lower-income countries, the stratified world economy enables higher-income countries to misappropriate global environmental space. Tied to their unsustainable consumption levels, this misappropriation by higher-income countries leads to the suppression of resource consumption in lower-income countries, well below globally sustainable thresholds, which negatively impacts the well-being of domestic populations. To evaluate key aspects of the theory, I test the hypothesis that lower-income countries with elevated levels of exports sent to higher-income countries exhibit lower consumption-based environmental demand, measured as per-capita ecological footprints. Findings for generalized least squares panel regression analyses of 66 lower-income countries from 1975 to 2000 confirm the hypothesis, providing support for the theory. Additional results indicate that the strength of the hypothesized relationship increased in magnitude during the 25-year period. These findings hold, net of the effects of economic development, ecological conditions, and other structural factors.	1	Andrew K. Jorgenson
Kmec, Julie & Sheryl Skaggs. 2009. 'Organizational Variation in Formal Equal Employment Opportunity Structures.' Sociological Forum. 24:1 47-75.	Sociological Forum	2009	1	This article identifies the factors associated with variation in the complexity of formal equal employment opportunity (EEO) structures across a sample of Washington and Oregon hospitals. Understanding such variation provides insight into two key organizational processes: commitment to workplace equality and response to external pressures for equality. We draw on Oliver's (1991) organizational strategic response theory to document the extent to which a hospital's patient demographics, legal regulation, economic sector, geographic location, and health system membership are related to complexity in the level of a hospital's formal EEO structures. Findings from ordered logistic regression analyses demonstrate that the presence of a nurse union and federal regulation of a hospital by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) are associated with less complex EEO structures. Meanwhile, urbanization is associated with more complex EEO structures. We discuss implications of these results for research and policy and offer the beginnings of a general theory of organizational variation.	2	Julie A. Kmec; Sheryl L. Skaggs

Sociological Forum	2009	3	Contemporary social theory suggests that the meaning of any object differs by how we, as social actors, respond and relate to it. The challenge for sociology lies in exploring the different strategies and practices recursively and productively embedded in these relationships. In this article, I present data from in-depth interviews with 20 home-based employees to illustrate how these individuals interact with familiar objects in their surroundings to form anchor points for diverse lines of conduct. Although I draw from a number of sociological theories in my analyses, I further utilize cognitive theory to outline three micro-psychological practices (i.e., routinization, goal targeting, and emotional alignment) that respondents apply in their attempt to establish the desired association between objects and identities. In this way, the article both extends previous lines of inquiry into the relationship between objects and actors, and makes a new contribution to the growing literature on culture and cognition.	1	Karen Danna Lynch

Sociological Forum. 24:1 104-134.	Sociological Forum	2009	2	A considerable body of research has found a positive relationship between parents' socioeconomic status and children's educational achievement and attainment. The predictive role of parents' socioeconomic status generally applies for most racial and ethnic groups, but that association does not always hold for groups that exhibit high levels of education, such as Asian Americans. This article considers the role of parents' education and occupation on children's educational and occupational attainment for Chinese Americans aged 18-32. The results corroborate the positive link between parents' socioeconomic status and children's educational and occupational attainments. Children of professionals command an educational and occupational advantage over children of entrepreneurs and children of manual workers. Yet, the children of entrepreneurs attend selective colleges and obtain professional occupations in proportions closely following those of the children of professionals. Although the educational attainments between the fathers who worked as entrepreneurs and those fathers engaged in manual work were comparable, it was the children of entrepreneurs who surpassed the children of manual workers with respect to educational and occupational achievement and attainment. This suggests that immigrant entrepreneurship contributes in the upward educational and occupational mobility of the children of entrepreneurs.	2	Dae Young Kim; Veena S. Kulkarni
Bjarnason, Thoroddur. 2009. 'Anomie Among European Adolescents: Conceptual and Empirical Clarification of a Multilevel Sociological Concept.' Sociological Forum. 24:1 135-161.	Sociological Forum	2009	2	Anomie is a complex, dynamic concept that refers simultaneously to a social state and an individual state of mind. Generations of sociologists have attempted to clarify, extend, and measure the concept at various levels of analysis. This article summarizes these developments around the twin concepts of exteriority and constraint. Exteriority refers to experiencing the social world as an objective, predictable reality, while constraint refers to the extent to which one experiences a personal commitment to the demands and expectations of society. The Anomie Scale of Exteriority and Constraint (ASEC) is presented and tested across various psychological and social outcomes among adolescents in 18 European countries. Exteriority is found to be primarily associated with more depression and less self-esteem, while constraint is associated with a lower probability of daily smoking, illicit drug use, truancy, and suicide attempts. Societal anomie is higher in eastern European countries and it has a strong negative correlation with GDP per capita and a marginally positive correlation with GDP growth. Societal anomie is also associated with higher baseline levels of depression, self-esteem, and illicit drug use. These results lend strong support to the theoretical construct of anomie as exteriority and constraint.	1	Thoroddur Bjarnason

Sociological Perspectives	2009	5	Human social life is messy, and as a result the practice of sociology is filled with tension, contradiction, conflict, and ambiguity. As a discipline, sociology has generated excellent theories and methodologies for dealing with this complexity. This presidential address suggests that the impact and resonance of sociological knowledge is enhanced further when we open ourselves to the tensions and contradictions we experience personally in our work as sociologists. Critical engagement with these personal conflicts deepens our understanding of the social subject and enriches the sociological imagination. Using the method of ``auto-historia,'' the author describes some of her own experiences of `` going deeper into the contradictions'' and the significance of this process for her professional evolution.	1	Jodi O'Brien
Mencken, F., Christopher Bader & Elizabeth Embry. 2009. 'in God We Trust: Images of God and Trust in the United States Among the Highly Religious.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:1 23-38.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	11	In this analysis, the authors use Greeley's ``religion as poetry'' model to frame an analysis of images of God and trust among the highly religious. Using the 2005 Baylor Religion Survey, the authors regress four ordinal measures of social trust on two images of God measures and a bank of religion and demographic controls. The authors find that having a loving image of God creates greater levels of trust in all four measures among the highly religious. They also find that having an image of God as angry creates less trust in all four measures of trust. Implications for theory and research on trust and civic engagement are discussed in the conclusion.	3	F. Carson Mencken; Christopher Bader; Elizabeth Embry
Berg, Justin. 2009. 'White Public Opinion Toward Undocumented Immigrants: Threat and Interpersonal Environment.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:1 39-58.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	11	Public opinion toward undocumented immigration is discussed in the popular media yet receives less attention in the social science literature. With data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U. S. Census, and the General Social Survey, this study examines whites' immigration opinions in 1996 and 2004. The results indicate that in 1996 whites who lived in areas with greater unemployment were more likely to favor government action against undocumented immigrants, while in 2004 whites who lived in areas with more Latino residents were less likely to favor such action. Whites who are embedded in educated networks and networks with racially different contacts are more likely to be sympathetic toward undocumented immigrants. Older networks were associated with restrictionist opinions. The interpersonal environment appears to remain consequential for whites, even if they have no contact with undocumented immigrants. This study finds that opinion formation results from broad demographic and small interpersonal structures.	1	Justin Allen Berg
Grant, Don, Kathleen O'Neil & Laura Stephens. 2009. 'Pluralistic Ignorance Among Assembled Peers.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:1 59-79.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	0	Sociologists have long been interested in pluralistic ignorance-situations where a majority of individuals assume that most of their peers think differently than themselves when, in fact, their attitudes are similar. Recently, sociologists have suggested that pluralistic ignorance is especially likely to occur when peers are gathered together and may explain why group members often refrain from discussing their ultimate concerns with each other. However, researchers have not indicated what factors besides physical proximity might create pluralistic ignorance. Nor have they employed methods that can specify how causal factors combine to produce multiple routes to pluralistic ignorance. To remedy this situation, this article suggests several factors that may make others' opinions more or less transparent. It also proposes an analytical strategy that can identify which combinations of these factors are associated with misperceptions and illustrates how it might be applied. Implications of this study for future research are discussed.	3	Don Grant; Kathleen O'Neil; Laura Stephens
Lindemann, Danielle. 2009. 'From Fire and Brimstone to Property Values: the Changing Style of Arguments Against Pornographic Industries, Atlanta, 1969-1997.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:1 81-101.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	1	Previous literature on moral reform has, with some notable exceptions, focused on the generation of moralistic sentiment, rather than the rhetoric through which it is deployed. This analysis adds an important coda to this literature by drawing further attention to the distinction between content and style when assessing moral-reform arguments. Examining every argument ( N = 540) made against a pornographic business in Atlanta, Georgia, from 1969 to 1997, as indexed by articles in the city's major newspaper, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, it argues that the tendency to frame antipornography arguments in instrumental terms exists throughout the years of the study, but it becomes more pronounced over time. A compelling explanation for the shift in rhetoric is that individuals still valued morality in the 1980s and 1990s but framed their arguments in ways that maximized their efficacy, policy wise. Implications of these findings for broader sociological issues are discussed.	1	Danielle Lindemann
Adams, Josh. 2009. 'Bodies of Change: a Comparative Analysis of Media Representations of Body Modification Practices.' Sociological Perspectives. 52:1 103-129.	Sociological Perspectives	2009	9	This article examines how mainstream media frame and represent cosmetic surgery, tattooing, and body piercing as methods of body modification. Through an analysis of seventy-two newspaper articles on cosmetic surgery, tattooing, and body piercing, this article shows how cosmetic surgery and tattooing are positively presented as consumer lifestyle options, while piercing is often negatively framed as an unhealthy and problematic practice. Similarly, findings indicate that risks associated with cosmetic surgery and tattooing are frequently downplayed, as are tattooing's associations with deviance, while the potential risks related to body piercing are overemphasized. Gender is also a prominent framing device, typically as a method of reinforcing normative appearance expectations. This article concludes by discussing how these framing techniques reflect preexisting social understandings of body modification practices while simultaneously informing and shaping the broader public opinion.	1	Josh Adams
Uggen, Christopher & Chika Shinohara. 2009. 'Sexual Harassment Comes of Age: a Comparative Analysis of the United States and Japan.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:2 201-234.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	5	Public consciousness of sexual harassment, or sekuhara, emerged much later in Japan than in the United States. This article, the first comparative study of sexual harassment in the two nations, explores how consciousness of a new legal category diffuses across nations and begins to take root in younger cohorts. Analyses of the U.S. General Social Survey and the Japanese Survey on Working Women's Consciousness show how age cohorts entering the labor force following major equal opportunity legislation report more sexual harassment than do older cohorts. We first conduct a separate nation-specific analysis and then pool the data sets to test for national differences with cross-product interaction terms. The effects of age, income, and job satisfaction all differ significantly between the United States and Japan. Family and life course factors are also important predictors, particularly in Japan. We interpret these results based on the extant literature on sexual harassment, legal consciousness over the life course, and comparative research on workplace behaviors.	2	Christopher Uggen; Chika Shinohara
Weitzer, Ronald & Rod Brunson. 2009. 'Strategic Responses to the Police Among Inner-city Youth.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:2 235-256.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	6	Research on police-citizen relations is largely focused on how police officers treat citizens, with much less attention given to how citizens behave toward officers. Several studies report that citizens' demeanor affects the way they are treated by police, but researchers have neglected the larger question of how citizens manage their contacts with officers more generally, outside the parameters of face-to-face encounters. The question is particularly salient for young males living in high-crime, inner-city neighborhoods-many of whom have frequent, negative contacts with or observations of the police. This article examines the contours of the youths' strategic responses to the police, drawing on in-depth interviews conducted in disadvantaged neighborhoods in St. Louis. Our analysis draws on Hirschman's framework of exit, voice, and loyalty as options available to individuals when dealing with problematic organizations.	2	Ronald Weitzer; Rod K. Brunson
Levine, Judith. 2009. 'It's a Man's Job, or So They Say: the Maintenance of Sex Segregation in a Manufacturing Plant.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:2 257-282.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	3	Following Reskin's call for case studies that investigate how inequality is maintained, this article investigates the mechanisms that limit women's mobility into traditionally male job titles in a manufacturing plant and the barriers to women's resistance of these mechanisms. The article demonstrates the ways in which formal structures, such as departmental design and promotion procedures, combine with informal social interactions in maintaining sex segregation in the plant's job titles and departments. Blocked opportunity promotes competition for social rewards and animosity between mobile and immobile women, which divide women. Coupled with allegiances across gender lines, these divisions undermine the potential for solidarity among female workers, making resistance to gender-based barriers unlikely.	1	Judith A. Levine
Hohle, Randolph. 2009. 'the Body and Citizenship in Social Movement Research: Embodied Performances and the Deracialized Self in the Black Civil Rights Movement 1961-1965.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:2 283-307.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	3	In political and cultural theory, the body has been central to our understandings of political power, yet, the body remains absent in social movement research. This article examines the role of the body in social movements, focusing on how social movements shape bodily postures and techniques of affective self-mastery to represent idealized citizenship. Based on archival data and the concepts of performativity and performance, I use the cases of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference's Citizenship Schools and Role-Playing Simulations and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's Community Centers to show how the deracialized body was materialization of liberal civic culture that sought to: (1) severe identification with the racial group in favor of identifying with an idealized national identity; and (2) change what counts as good citizenship to change who counts as good citizens. I analyze the movement's pedagogy focusing on the ritualized repetition of embodied movements that deracialized the black political body by embedding idealized citizenship into bodily postures, which increased the probability for a successful performance. Although the deracialized body was vital to the passage of the national legislation, it served to hide geographical and economic differences within the black population, producing the false correlation of national policy change with local change.	1	Randolph Hohle
Meier, Ann & Gina Allen. 2009. 'Romantic Relationships From Adolescence to Young Adulthood: Evidence From the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:2 308-335.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	20	Theories of romantic relationship development posit a progression of involvement and intensity with age, relationship duration, and experience in romantic relationships. Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study tests these propositions by considering relationship type and patterns of relationships over the course of adolescence and their influence on relationship formation in young adulthood. Results confirm recent theories of relationship progression and the findings of smaller-scale empirical studies. Moreover, the findings add depth to debates on racial differences in relationship formation and demonstrate the developmental currency of adolescent relationship experience for young-adult relationship formation. Rather than being trivial or fleeting, adolescent romantic relationships are an integral part of the social scaffolding on which young-adult romantic relationships rest.	2	Ann Meier; Gina Allen
Ortiz, Susan & Vincent Roscigno. 2009. 'Discrimination, Women, and Work: Processes and Variations by Race and Class.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:2 336-359.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	9	Research on gender and workplace stratification has made clear that persistent employment, wage, and mobility gaps exist, and that discrimination at organizational and interactional levels is playing a role. Few studies, however, have been able to directly capture processes involved. In this article, we draw on unique qualitative and quantitative data pertaining to verified cases of workplace sex and race discrimination (1988 to 2003), and analyze the discriminatory experiences of African-American and white women across various occupational statuses. Notable are high levels of discriminatory firing for both groups, but higher instances of race-based promotional discrimination for black women-a pattern partially linked to their disparate concentration in sex-segregated workplaces and in positions of lower occupational prestige. Our qualitative immersion into case materials reveals influential mechanisms and employer justifications, unique manifestations of differential treatment on the job, and the use of ``soft skill'' criteria in gatekeeper decision making. We conclude by discussing important dimensions of workplace discrimination for women, variations by social class and race status, and how complexities of status matter for what women experience and gatekeeper behavior.	2	Susan Y.

Draus, Paul. 2009. 'Substance Abuse and Slow-motion Disasters: the Case of Detroit.' Sociological Quarterly. 50:2 360-382.	Sociological Quarterly	2009	3	In this article, I focus on problem substance use as one outcome of an underlying, ``slow-motion disaster'' caused by the long-term collision between corrosive structural processes, counterproductive social policies, and vulnerable populations. Using the city of Detroit as an illustration, I offer an original conceptual model for linking the causes and cascading consequences of slow-motion disasters. This model highlights the embedded connections between structural factors, such as racial segregation and systemic unemployment, and multiple destructive outcomes, including health and crime disparities, as well as problem substance use. Finally, I conclude that sociological researchers must engage with broader publics and diverse coalitions if they are to contribute to an alternative social policy-a holistic, regional ``disaster response''-that takes multiple layers of causality into account, and addresses the core of vulnerabilities that make such disasters possible.	1	Paul J.

Molm, Linda, David Schaefer & Jessica Collett. 2009. 'Fragile and Resilient Trust: Risk and Uncertainty in Negotiated and Reciprocal Exchange.' Sociological Theory. 27:1 1-32.	Sociological Theory	2009	19	Both experimental and ethnographic studies show that reciprocal exchanges (in which actors unilaterally provide benefits to each other without formal agreements) produce stronger trust than negotiated exchanges secured by binding agreements. We develop the theoretical role of risk and uncertainty as causal mechanisms that potentially explain these results, and then test their effects in two laboratory experiments that vary risk and uncertainty within negotiated and reciprocal forms of exchange. We increase risk in negotiated exchanges by making agreements nonbinding and decrease uncertainty in reciprocal exchanges by having actors communicate their intentions. Our findings support three main theoretical conclusions. (1) Increasing risk in negotiated exchange produces levels of trust comparable to those in reciprocal exchange only if the partner's trustworthiness is near-absolute. (2) Decreasing uncertainty in reciprocal exchange either increases or decreases trust, depending on network structure. (3) Even when reciprocal and negotiated exchanges produce comparable levels of trust, their trust differs in kind, with reciprocal exchange partners developing trust that is more resilient and affect-based.	3	Linda D.

Perry, Pamela & Alexis Shotwell. 2009. 'Relational Understanding and White Antiracist Praxis.' Sociological Theory. 27:1 33-50.	Sociological Theory	2009	2	In this article, we argue that, in order for white racial consciousness and practice to shift toward an antiracist praxis, a relational understanding of racism, the ``self,'' and society is necessary. We find that such understanding arises from a confluence of propositional, affective, and tacit forms of knowledge about racism and one's own situatedness within it. We consider the claims sociologists have made about transformations in racial consciousness, bringing sociological theories of racism into dialogue with research on whiteness and antiracism. We assert that sociological research on white racism and ``whiteness'' tends to privilege propositional and tacit/common sense knowledge, respectively, as critical to shifting white racial consciousness. Research on antiracism privileges affective knowledge as the source of antiracist change. We examine some of Perry's recent ethnographic research with white people who attended either multiracial or majority white high schools to argue that the confluence of these three types of knowledge is necessary to transform white racial praxis because it produces a relational understanding of self and ``other,'' and, by extension, race, racism, and antiracist practice.	2	Pamela Perry; Alexis Shotwell
Fuhse, Jan. 2009. 'the Meaning Structure of Social Networks.' Sociological Theory. 27:1 51-73.	Sociological Theory	2009	21	This essay proposes to view networks as sociocultural structures. Following authors from Leopold von Wiese and Norbert Elias to Gary Alan Fine and Harrison White, networks are configurations of social relationships interwoven with meaning. Social relationships as the basic building blocks of networks are conceived of as dynamic structures of reciprocal (but not necessarily symmetric) expectations between alter and ego. Through their transactions, alter and ego construct an idiosyncratic ``relationship culture'' comprising symbols, narratives, and relational identities. The coupling of social relationships to networks, too, is heavily laden with meaning. The symbolic construction of persons is one instance of this coupling. Another instance is the application of social categories (like race or gender), which both map and structure social networks. The conclusion offers an agenda for research on this ``meaning structure of social networks.''.	1	Jan A. Fuhse
Halpin, Michael, Melanie Phillips & John Oliffe. 2009. 'Prostate Cancer Stories in the Canadian Print Media: Representations of Illness, Disease and Masculinities.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:2 155-169.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	4	Despite the popularity of print media as an information source for men with prostate cancer, the representation of prostate cancer within this medium remains relatively understudied. This article details the findings from an analysis of prostate cancer articles published in two Canadian national newspapers, The Globe and Mail and the National Post, from January 2001 through to December 2006. The 817 prostate cancer articles published during this period were retrieved and reviewed using manifest and latent analyses. Three article categories, illness perspectives, medical perspectives and supplementary were identified in the manifest analysis. The latent analysis was guided by the connections between masculinities and prostate cancer in the newspapers' stories. Findings indicated a low frequency of articles that substantively discussed prostate cancer and that the descriptive content reproduced hegemonic masculine ideals, such as competition and stoicism. The presentation of a truncated illness trajectory and privileging of the curative aspects of biomedicine also depicted medicalised male bodies. Any discussion on the negative effects of treatment or explicit references to marginalised forms of masculinity was conspicuously absent. These findings support how representations of prostate cancer in Canadian newspapers predominately replicate detrimental ideologies and perspectives of men's health.	3	Michael Halpin; Melanie Phillips; John L.

Horne, Judith & Sally Wiggins. 2009. 'Doing Being `on the Edge': Managing the Dilemma of Being Authentically Suicidal in an Online Forum.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:2 170-184.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	16	Those who attempt suicide have often been described as `crying for help', and there are implications if such cries are not taken seriously. This paper examines how users of an Internet forum for `suicidal thoughts' work up their authenticity in their opening posts, and how these are responded to by fellow forum users. Data were taken from two Internet forums on suicide over a period of one month and were analysed using discursive psychology. The analysis demonstrates that participants display their authenticity through four practices: narrative formatting, going `beyond' depression, displaying rationality and not explicitly asking for help. Furthermore, both initial and subsequent posts worked up identities as being psychologically `on the edge' of life and death. The analysis suggests that the forum in part works as a site for suicidal identities to be tested out, authenticated and validated by individuals. We conclude with some suggestions for the supportive work of suicide `postvention'.	2	Judith Horne; Sally Wiggins
Bottorff, Joan, Jenny Radsma, Mary Kelly & John Oliffe. 2009. 'Fathers' Narratives of Reducing and Quitting Smoking.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:2 185-200.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	12	Despite much attention on women's efforts to reduce or stop smoking during pregnancy and postpartum, less attention has been directed to fathers' experiences in modifying their smoking. Using narrative methods, interviews with 29 new fathers were examined to identify different ways in which men approached reducing or quitting smoking. Four storylines were identified: the cold turkey storyline framed quitting smoking as a snap decision with no need for support or smoking cessation aids; the planned reduction storyline focused on building up reasons to quit and developing detailed strategies to enhance the likelihood of success; the baby as the patch storyline dramatised how the baby displaced the need to smoke, increased motivation for cessation and enhanced success; and, finally, a story of forced reduction that highlighted difficulties with smoking cessation for a highly addicted smoker and the tension and conflict this created in his relationship with his partner. Common to all the storylines was the men's reluctance to rely on smoking cessation resources; instead, self-reliance, willpower, and autonomy figured more prominently in their narratives. The findings from this study support developing gender-sensitive tobacco reduction interventions for fathers who smoke.	4	Joan L. Bottorff; Jenny Radsma; Mary Kelly; John L. Oliffe
Ceci, Christine & Mary Purkis. 2009. 'Bridging Gaps in Risk Discourse: Home Care Case Management and Client Choices.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:2 201-214.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	5	This paper examines, and problematises, a well-entrenched conceptualisation of how home care case management practice works - that is, that case managers offer alternatives, and clients make choices. This understanding of practice is reinforced by organisational policy that states that clients have the right to live at risk if that is their choice. Analysis of data from a field study of home care practice in a western Canadian city, drawing predominantly on case managers' accounts of actual practice situations, underscores the limitations of such a view, and suggests that conceptualising such practices as ongoing and fragile negotiations between freedom and security offers a more useful frame for thinking through the distance and difference between current home care policy and practice and what people might actually need.	2	Christine Ceci; Mary Ellen Purkis
Delormier, Treena, Katherine Frohlich & Louise Potvin. 2009. 'Food and Eating as Social Practice - Understanding Eating Patterns as Social Phenomena and Implications for Public Health.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:2 215-228.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	26	Globally, public health agencies recognise obesity trends among populations as a priority. Explanations for population obesity patterns are linked to obesogenic environments and societal trends which encourage patterns of overeating and little physical activity. However, obesity prevention and nutrition intervention focus predominantly on changing individual level eating behaviours. Disappointingly, behaviour-based nutrition education approaches to changing population eating patterns have met with limited success. Sociological perspectives propose that underlying social relations can help explain collective food and eating patterns, and suggest an analysis of the sociocultural context for understanding population eating patterns. We propose a theoretical framework for the examination of eating patterns as social phenomena. Giddens' structuration theory, in particular his concept of social practices understood as an interplay of `agency' and `social structure' (rules and resources), is used to study food choice patterns. We discuss the application of these concepts for understanding routine food choice practices of families, elaborating how rules and resources configure the enabling or constraining conditions under which actors make food choices. The framework assists in characterising how social structural properties are integral to food choice practices, and could direct attention to these when considering nutrition interventions aimed at changing population eating patterns.	3	Treena Delormier; Katherine L.

'the Impact of Pay-for-performance on Professional Boundaries in Uk General Practice: an Ethnographic Study.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:2 229-245.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	15	The 2004 new General Medical Services (nGMS) contract exemplifies trends across the public services towards increased definition, measurement and regulation of professional work, with general practice income now largely dependent on the quality of care provided across a range of clinical and organisational indicators known collectively as the `Quality and Outcomes Framework' (QOF). This paper reports an ethnographically based study of the impact of the new contract and the financial incentives contained within it on professional boundaries in UK general practice. The distribution of clinical and administrative work has changed significantly and there has been a new concentration of authority, with QOF decision making and monitoring being led by an internal QOF team of clinical and managerial staff who make the major practice-level decisions about QOF, monitor progress against targets, and intervene to resolve areas or indicators at risk of missing targets. General practitioners and nurses, however, appear to have accommodated these changes by re-creating long established narratives on professional boundaries and clinical hierarchies. This paper is concerned with the impact of these new arrangements on existing clinical hierarchies.	7	Suzanne Grant; Guro Huby; Francis Watkins; Kath Checkland; Ruth McDonald; Huw Davies; Bruce Guthrie
O'Reilly, Michelle, Mary Dixon-Woods, Emma Angell, Richard Ashcroft & Alan Bryman. 2009. 'Doing Accountability: a Discourse Analysis of Research Ethics Committee Letters.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:2 246-261.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	6	Research ethics committees (RECs) are charged with adjudicating the ethical status of research projects, and determining the conditions necessary for such projects to proceed. Both because of their position in the research process and because of the controversial nature of ethical judgements, RECs' views and decisions need to be accountable. In this paper we use techniques of discourse analysis to show how REC decision letters `do' accountability. Using a sample of 260 letters from three datasets, we identify a range of discursive devices used in letters written by RECs. These include drawing attention to: the process behind the decision, including its collaborative nature; holding the applicants accountable, by implying that any decision made by the REC can be attributed to the performance of the applicants; referring to specialist expertise; and calling upon external authorities. These tactics `do' accountability by showing that routines of ethical assessment have been enacted, by establishing the factuality of claims, and by managing questions of fault and blame attribution. They may, however, also risk undermining legitimacy by failing to acknowledge the inherent contestability of ethical decision making or the limited nature of the cultural authority accorded to RECs, and thus may appear as an illegitimate exercise of power.	5	Michelle O'Reilly; Mary Dixon-Woods; Emma Angell; Richard Ashcroft; Alan Bryman
Iedema, Rick, Christine Jorm, John Wakefield, Cherie Ryan & Stewart Dunn. 2009. 'Practising Open Disclosure: Clinical Incident Communication and Systems Improvement.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:2 262-277.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	5	This article explores the way that professionals are being inducted into articulating apologies to consumers of their services, in this case clinicians apologising to patients. The article focuses on the policy of Open Disclosure that is being adopted by health care organisations in the US, Canada, the UK and Australia and other nations. Open Disclosure policy mandates `open discussion of clinical incidents' with patient victims. In Australia, Open Disclosure policy implementation is currently being complemented by intensive staff training, involving simulation of apology scenarios with actor-patients. The article presents an analysis of data collected from such training sessions. The analysis shows how simulated apologising engages frontline staff in evaluating the efficacy of their disclosures, and how staff may thereby be inducted into reconciling their affective and reflexive sensibilities with their organisational and professional responsibilities, and thereby produce the required organisational apology. The article concludes that Open Disclosure, besides potentially relaxing tensions between clinicians and consumers, may also affect how staff experience and enact their role in the overall system of health care organisation.	5	Rick Iedema; Christine Jorm; John Wakefield; Cherie Ryan; Stewart Dunn
Jutel, Annemarie. 2009. 'Sociology of Diagnosis: a Preliminary Review.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 31:2 278-299.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2009	59	Diagnoses are the classification tools of medicine, and are pivotal in the ways medicine exerts its role in society. Their sociological study is commonly subsumed under the rubrics of medicalisation, history of medicine and theory of disease. Diagnosis is, however, a powerful social tool, with unique features and impacts which deserve their own specific analysis. The process of diagnosis provides the framework within which medicine operates, punctuates the values which medicine espouses, and underlines the authoritative role of both medicine and the doctor. Diagnosis takes place at a salient juncture between illness and disease, patient and doctor, complaint and explanation. Despite calls for its establishment, almost two decades ago (Brown 1990), there is not yet a clear sociology of diagnosis. This paper argues that there should be, and, as a first step, draws together a number of threads of medical sociology that potentially contribute to this proposed sociology of diagnosis, including the place of diagnosis in the institution of medicine, the social framing of disease definitions, the means by which diagnosis confers authority to medicine, and how that authority is challenged. Through this preliminary review, I encourage sociology to consider the specific role of diagnosis in view of establishing a specific sub-disciplinary field.	1	Annemarie Jutel
Adamczyk, Amy. 2009. 'Socialization and Selection in the Link Between Friends' Religiosity and the Transition to Sexual Intercourse.' Sociology of Religion. 70:1 5-27.	Sociology of Religion	2009	8	Although much research has examined how friends influence teens' sexual behaviors, little attention has been given to the association between friends' religiosity and coital debut. This study looks at the processes that could produce this association, examining whether friends' religiosity influences the transition to sexual intercourse and whether teens sort into friendship groups on the basis of consistency between their virginity status and their Mends' religious attitudes. Using two waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this paper finds that friends' religiosity influences respondents' coital debut even after accounting for the proportion of friends who have had sex. Likewise, teens who delay their coital debut tend to switch to more religious friends, while teens who have had their coital debut tend to switch to less religious friends. These findings add to a growing body of research on the relationship between religious contextual effects and individual behavior.	1	Amy Adamczyk
Burdette, Amy & Terrence Hill. 2009. 'Religious Involvement and Transitions Into Adolescent Sexual Activities.' Sociology of Religion. 70:1 28-48.	Sociology of Religion	2009	13	Using two waves of data from the National Survey of Youth and Religion (2002, 2005), a national probability sample of 3,290 adolescents ages 13 to 17, we test whether religious involvement (church attendance, religious salience, private religiosity, and family religiosity) is associated with delayed transitions into sexual activities (sexual touching, oral sex, and sexual intercourse). We also consider whether the rate of these transitions varies according to important social characteristics (age, gender, and race/ethnicity). Our results suggest that multiple indicators of religious involvement (especially religious salience) are associated with delayed transitions into selected sexual activities. We also find that the rate of transition into sexual activities associated with private and family religiosity varies according to key social characteristics.	2	Amy M. Burdette; Terrence D. Hill
Tabak, Melanie & Kristin Mickelson. 2009. 'Religious Service Attendance and Distress: the Moderating Role of Stressful Life Events and Race/ethnicity.' Sociology of Religion. 70:1 49-64.	Sociology of Religion	2009	5	Research findings on religiosity and mental health have been somewhat inconsistent over the years, leading researchers to examine different dimensions of religiosity to determine their individual and combined impacts on mental health. Aside from varying operationalizations of religiosity, stressful life events and race/ethnicity may be important moderators of the impact of religiosity on mental health. Secondary data analyses on a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults reveal a curvilinear relation of religious service attendance on distress. Specifically, those reporting moderate levels of service attendance also report lower levels of distress than their counterparts. Moreover, there were racial/ethnic differences with Hispanics and African Americans showing a stronger relationship between attendance and distress than non-Hispanic whites. However, there was no evidence that stressful life events interacted with attendance to explain distress.	2	Melanie A. Tabak; Kristin D. Mickelson
Mencken, F., Christopher Bader & Ye Kim. 2009. 'Round Trip to Hell in a Flying Saucer: the Relationship Between Conventional Christian and Paranormal Beliefs in the United States.' Sociology of Religion. 70:1 65-85.	Sociology of Religion	2009	5	In this paper we examine the relationship between conventional Christian and paranormal beliefs. Conventional Christian beliefs are those such as belief in Heaven, Hell, and the existence of God. Paranormal beliefs include belief in UFOs, astrology, haunting, communication with the dead, and Bigfoot. We test three hypotheses (deviance) (marginalization, small step, and compatibility) about the relationship between these two belief types with factor analysis and regression analysis. The data we use are from the Baylor Religion Survey, a national random sample collected by the Gallup Organization in fall 2005. The factor analysis results show that there are two well-defined spheres of supernatural beliefs, one conventional Christian and one paranormal. We find a net positive relationship between these two belief clusters. However, a test of the compatibility hypothesis shows that church attendance and religious tradition moderate the effects of conventional Christian beliefs on paranormal beliefs. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for theory and research.	3	F. Carson Mencken; Christopher D. Bader; Ye Jung Kim
Wesely, Jennifer. 2009. '``mom Said We Had a Money Maker'': Sexualization and Survival Contexts Among Homeless Women.' Symbolic Interaction. 32:2 91-105.	Symbolic Interaction	2009	1	This study examines the lived experiences of a group of homeless women, with particular attention to their ``sexualization'' and how this frames their interpretations of and responses to their homelessness. A symbolic interactionist approach locates the social construction of femininity with its emphasis on sexualized embodiment within larger structural conditions of gender inequality. The impact of these structural conditions intersects with homelessness for the participants in this study. In-depth interviews at a homeless shelter reveal the early sexualization that degraded and violated the women, eroding their self-worth as young girls and, later, as adults. These circumstances shaped their gendered fears and vulnerabilities and influenced the context of their survival.	1	Jennifer K. Wesely
Han, Chong-suk. 2009. 'Asian Girls Are Prettier: Gendered Presentations as Stigma Management Among Gay Asian Men.' Symbolic Interaction. 32:2 106-122.	Symbolic Interaction	2009	2	Despite the well-documented cases of racism toward gay Asian men in the gay community, there is currently little research on how gay Asian men manage racial stigma. In this article, I examine the racial stigma management strategies of gay Asian men. I examine the nature of gay racial stigma toward gay Asian men and find that they use gendered presentations to counter the stereotype that they are more feminine than gay white men. While some gay Asian men engender a hypermasculine presentation, others use a hyperfeminine presentation to trade a more-stigmatized status for one that is less stigmatizing. More important, these men actively embrace stereotypes to successfully make these transitions. This article demonstrates that stigmatized groups can manage stigma by highlighting their spoiled identities rather than attempting to minimize them.	1	Chong-suk Han
Scott, Susie. 2009. 'Reclothing the Emperor: the Swimming Pool as a Negotiated Order.' Symbolic Interaction. 32:2 123-145.	Symbolic Interaction	2009	5	This article examines the unspoken rules, routines, and rituals of the swimming pool, using ideas from negotiated order theory, Foucault, Goffman's dramaturgical theory, and symbolic interactionism. It identifies three sets of social norms: respect for personal space, respect for individuals' disciplinary regimes, and the desexualization of encounters. I show how these rules are (normally) followed or (occasionally) breached through various rituals, and examine the consequences for interaction order. The tale of ``The Emperor's New Clothes'' is used analogously to explain why actors cannot consciously attend to their precarious construction of reality, yet remain poised to defend it.	1	Susie Scott
Millard, Jennifer. 2009. 'Performing Beauty: Dove's ``real Beauty'' Campaign.' Symbolic Interaction. 32:2 146-168.	Symbolic Interaction	2009	1	Dove, a popular beauty brand, impressed some in the advertising world with its unique ``Campaign for Real Beauty'' and made others cringe. But little is known about how real women respond. ``Real'' beauty according to Dove means various shapes and sizes-flaws and all-and is the key to rebranding, rebuilding women's self-esteem, and redefining beauty standards. Drawing on interviews and focus groups with sixteen Canadian women and guided by social semiotics and dramaturgy, I examine Dove's presentation of beauty and women's reactions to it from a ``beauty as performance'' frame. This study examines processes of interpretation and finds that expressing beauty, the self, and a public image inextricably requires elements of performance.	1	Jennifer Millard
Aspers, Patrik. 2009. 'Knowledge and Valuation in Markets.' Theory and Society. 38:2 111-131.	Theory and Society	2009	13	The purpose of this theoretical article is to contribute to the analysis of knowledge and valuation in markets. In every market actors must know how to value its products. The analytical point of departure is the distinction between two ideal types of markets that are mutually exclusive, status and standard. In a status market, valuation is a function of the status rank orders or identities of the actors on both sides of the market, which is more entrenched than the value of what is traded in the market. In a market characterized by a standard, the situation is reversed; the scale of value is more entrenched than the rankings of actors in the market. In a status market actors need to know about the other actors involved as there is no scale of value for evaluating the items traded in the market independently of its buyers and sellers. In a standard market it is more important to know how to meet the standard in relation to which all items traded are valued. The article includes empirical examples and four testable hypotheses.	1	Patrik Aspers
Kim, Jaeeun. 2009. 'the Making and Unmaking of a ``transborder Nation'': South Korea During and After the Cold War.' Theory and Society. 38:2 133-164.	Theory and Society	2009	4	The burgeoning literature on transborder membership, largely focused on the thickening relationship between emigration states in the South and the postwar labor migrant populations and their descendants in North America or Western Europe, has not paid due attention to the long-term macroregional transformations that shape transborder national membership politics or to the bureaucratic practices of the state that undergird transborder claims-making. By comparing contentious transborder national membership politics in South Korea during the Cold War and Post-Cold War eras, this article seeks to overcome these limitations. In both periods, the membership status of colonial-era ethnic Korean migrants in Japan and northeast China and their descendants was the focus of contestation. The distinctiveness of the case-involving both a sustained period of colonial rule and a period of belated and divided nation-state building interwoven with the Cold War-highlights the crucial importance of three factors: (1) the dynamically evolving macro-regional context, which has shaped transborder national membership politics in the region in distinctive ways; (2) the essentially political, performative, and constitutive nature of transborder nation-building; and (3) the role of state registration and documentation practices in shaping the contours of transborder national membership politics in the long run. By incorporating Korea-and East Asia more broadly-into the comparative study of transborder nation-building, this article also lays the groundwork for future cross-regional comparative historical studies.	1	Jaeeun Kim
Wang, Junmin. 2009. 'Global-market Building as State Building: China's Entry Into the Wto and Market Reforms of China's Tobacco Industry.' Theory and Society. 38:2 165-194.	Theory and Society	2009	4	This article analyzes how China's increasing engagement in the global market induced significant institution-building in China's tobacco industry and enabled a power shift from the local authorities to the central authority in controlling this market. During this process of ``getting onto the international track,'' the central government reorganized the industrial tobacco systemand broke up the ``monopolies'' set up by local governments in order to enhance the competitive capacities of China's tobacco industry in the global market. Given such a concrete institutional change in China's tobacco industry, I propose the theory of `` global-market building as state building'' to explain the interactions among the global market, the nation-states, and the domestic market-building projects. I suggest that nation-states strategically seek to engage themselves in the global market and that, under certain circumstances by taking advantage of their global market engagement, the nation-states can enhance their abilities to govern the domestic market.	1	Junmin Wang
Patil, Vrushali. 2009. 'Contending Masculinities: the Gendered (re) Negotiation of Colonial Hierarchy in the United Nations Debates on Decolonization.' Theory and Society. 38:2 195-215.	Theory and Society	2009	3	The emergence of legal decolonization in the mid-twentieth century, as evidenced by the 1960 United Nations Declaration on the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and Peoples, is often understood through the lens of race and the disruption of racial hierarchy. If we take seriously the transnational feminist contention that the colonial racial order was also gendered, however, how might this perspective shift our understanding of decolonization? In this article, I explore the debates on decolonization that take place in the UN General Assembly from 19461960 that lead to the 1960 Declaration from a transnational feminist perspective to answer this question. Specifically, I use comparative historical and discourse methods of analysis to explore how colonialists and anti-colonialists negotiate the onset of legal decolonization, focusing especially on how colonialist hierarchies of race, culture, and gender are addressed in these debates. I argue that, on the one hand, colonialists rely on a paternalist masculinity to legitimate their rule (i.e., our dependencies require our rule the way a child requires a father). In response, anti-colonialists reply with a resistancemasculinity (i.e., ``colonialism is emasculating;'' ``decolonization is necessary for a return of masculine dignity''). I argue that decolonization in the United Nations transpires via contentions among differentially racialized masculinities. Ultimately, a transnational feminist perspective that centers the intersection of race and gender offers a richer analysis than a perspective that examines race alone.	1	Vrushali Patil
Willer, Robb. 2009. 'Groups Reward Individual Sacrifice: the Status Solution to the Collective Action Problem.' American Sociological Review. 74:1 23-43.	American Sociological Review	2009	58	One of sociology's classic puzzles is how groups motivate their members to set aside self-interest and contribute to collective action. This article presents a solution to the problem based on status as a selective incentive motivating contribution. Contributors to collective action signal their motivation to help the group and consequently earn diverse benefits from group members in particular higher status and these rewards encourage greater giving to the group in the future. In Study 1, high contributors to collective action earned higher status, exercised more interpersonal influence, were cooperated with more, and received gifts of greater value. Studies 2 and 3 replicated these findings while discounting alternative explanations. All three studies show that giving to the group mattered because it signaled an individual an motivation to help the group. Study 4 finds that participants who received status for their contributions subsequently contributed more and viewed the group more positively. These results demonstrate how the allocation of respect to contributors shapes group productivity and solidarity, offering a solution to the collective action problem.	1	Robb Willer
Ridgeway, Cecilia, Yan Li, Kristan Erickson, Kristen Backor & Justine Tinkler. 2009. 'How Easily Does a Social Difference Become a Status Distinction? Gender Matters.' American Sociological Review. 74:1 44-62.	American Sociological Review	2009	15	Are people quick to adopt status beliefs about a social difference that lead them to treat others unequally? In a test of status construction theory, two experiments show that men and women form equally strong status beliefs from only two encounters with others. Men act powerfully on these new beliefs in their next encounters with others but women do not, possibly because women Ace greater social risks for acting oil ambiguous status advantages. Women are just as likely as men, however, to treat someone unequally on the basis of an established status distinction. This suggests that men are first movers in the emergence of status distinctions, but women eventually adopt the distinctions as well. Our results show that people readily transform social differences into status distinctions-distinctions that act as formidable forces of inequality.	5	Cecilia L. Ridgeway; Yan E. Li; Kristan G.

Sauder, Michael & Wendy Espeland. 2009. 'the Discipline of Rankings: Tight Coupling and Organizational Change.' American Sociological Review. 74:1 63-82.	American Sociological Review	2009	64	This article demonstrates that value of Foucault's conception of discipline for understanding organization responses to rankings. Using a case study of law schools, we explain why rankings have permeated law schools so extensively and why these organizations have been unable to buffer these institutional pressures. Foucault's depiction of two important processes, surveillance and normalization, show how rankings change perceptions of legal education through both coercive and seductive means. This approach advances organizational theory by highlighting conditions that affect the prevalence and effectiveness of buffering. Decoupling is not determined solely by the external enforcement of institutional pressures or the capacity of organizational actors to buffer or hide some activities. Members' tendency to internalize these pressures, to become self-disciplining, is also salient. Internalization is fostered by the anxiety that rankins produce, by their allure for the administrators who try to manipulate them, and by the resistance they provoke. Rankings are just one example of the public measures of performance that are becoming increasingly influential in many institutional environments, and understanding how organizations respond to these measures is a crucial task for scholars.	2	Michael Sauder; Wendy Nelson Espeland
Walker, Edward. 2009. 'Privatizing Participation: Civic Change and the Organizational Dynamics of Grassroots Lobbying Firms.' American Sociological Review. 74:1 83-105.	American Sociological Review	2009	18	This article highlights the shifting boundaries between the public and private spheres in advanced capitalist societies through an examination of grassroots lobbying firms. These organizations, which became a fixture in U.S. politics in the 1970s and have grown in number and prominence since, subsidize public participation on behalf of corporations, industry groups, and associations using direct mail, telephoning, and by mobilizing members and stakeholders. I examine the dynamics of this organizational population whose existence calls attention to broad transformations in civil society-with reference to dramatic growth in the organizational populations of civic and trade associations. Results, derived from a Generalized Estimating Equation panel regression of firm founding events across U.S. regions from 1972 to 2002, suggest that the increasing formal organization of civil society has supported the development of a field of organizations that subsidize participation. These organizations do so, however, in a manner that restricts the development of social capital and civic skills while augmenting the voice of private interests in public and legislative discourse.	1	Edward T.

Weber, Klaus, L. Thomas & Hayagreeva Rao. 2009. 'From Streets to Suites: How the Anti-biotech Movement Affected German Pharmaceutical Firms.' American Sociological Review. 74:1 106-127.	American Sociological Review	2009	36	How do social movements affect decisions within corporations, such as the commercialization of new technologies? We suggest that the effect of movement activism is conditioned by the internal polity and therefore, varies across organizations. This article examines how the anti-genetic movement in Germany during the 1980s affected six domestic pharmaceutical firms' commercialization of biotechnology We develop a process model of how movements penetrate the relatively closed polity of private organizations. External contestation weakened the position of internal champions of biotechnology, precipitated divisions among organizational elites, and undermined collective commitment to the technology The movement also increased perceptions of investment uncertainty but the consequences of this uncertainty depended on organizational logics of decision making. As a result, investments in some firms were tilted away from domestic biotechnology projects. The model also explains this variation in organization-level outcomes of movement contestation.	3	Klaus Weber; L. G. Thomas; Hayagreeva Rao
Bandelj, Nina. 2009. 'the Global Economy as Instituted Process: the Case of Central and Eastern Europe.' American Sociological Review. 74:1 128-149.	American Sociological Review	2009	16	I argue that economic globalization, indicated by the tremendous rise in world foreign direct investment (FDI) in recent decades, is not driven simply by investor considerations of economic risk and return, but is significantly shaped by the construction of demand for foreign capital by receiving states. States signal this demand through the levels of formal and substantive legitimacy they grant to FDI They institutionalize globalization in formal rule as a normatively desirable development strategy. States substantiate this commitment by providing domestic and foreign actors with ideational and organizational resources to facilitate FDI To illustrate this argument, I use the case of Central and Eastern Europe, which was large v closed to global capital before the collapse of Communism. Analyses of quantitative and qualitative data show that substantive legitimacy granted to FDI by host states, more than formal regulations, determined the size of foreign capital flows into postsocialist countries in the first decade of market reform. These findings point to social foundations of macroeconomic trends beyond the re instrumental considerations of risk and return privileged in previous research.	1	Nina Bandelj
Hsu, Greta, Oezgecan Kocak & Michael Hannan. 2009. 'Multiple Category Memberships in Markets: an Integrative Theory and Two Empirical Tests.' American Sociological Review. 74:1 150-169.	American Sociological Review	2009	47	This article examines the effects of market specialization on economic and social outcomes. Integrating two perspectives, we explore why products that span multiple categories suffer social and economic disadvantages. According to the audience-side perspective, audience members refer to established categories to make sense of products. Products that incorporate features from multiple categories are perceived to be pool fits Mill category expectations and less appealing than category specialists. The producer-side view holds that spanning categories reduces one ability to effectively target each category's audience, which decreases appeal to audience members. Rather than treating these as rival explanations, A,e propose that both processes matter and offer a systematic, integrated account of how penalties arise as a consequence of audience-side and producer side processes. We analyze data from two dissimilar contexts, eBay auctions and U.S. future-film projects, to test the central implications of our theory Together these tests provide support for our integrated approach and suggest that both processes contribute to the penalties associated with category spanning.	3	Greta Hsu; Oezgecan Kocak; Michael T.

A'Hearn, Brian, Franco Peracchi & Giovanni Vecchi. 2009. 'Height and the Normal Distribution: Evidence From Italian Military Data.' Demography. 46:1 1-25.	Demography	2009	6	Researches modeling historical heights have typically relied on the restrictive assumption of a normal distribution, only, the mean of which is affected by age, income, nutrition, disease, and similar influenced. To avoid these restrictive assumptions, we develop a new semiparametric approach in which covariates are allowed to of height the entire distribution without imposing any parametric shape. We apply our method to a new database of height distributions for Italian provinces, drawn from conscription records, of unprecedented length and geographical disaggregation. Our method allows us to standardize distributions to a single age and calculate moments of the distribution that are comparable through time. Our method also allows us to generate counterfactual distributions for. a range of ages, front which we derive age-height profiles. These profiles reveal how, the adolescent growth spurt (AGS) distorts the distribution of stature, and they document the earlier and earlier onset of the AGS as living conditions improved over the second half of the nineteenth century. Our new estimates of provincial mean height also reveal a previously unnoticed ``regime switch'' from regional convergence to divergence in this period.	3	Brian A'Hearn; Franco Peracchi; Giovanni Vecchi
Reither, Eric, Robert Hauser & Karen Swallen. 2009. 'Predicting Adult Health and Mortality From Adolescent Facial Characteristics in Yearbook Photographs.' Demography. 46:1 27-41.	Demography	2009	12	Several important longitudinal studies in the social sciences have omitted biomarkers that are routinely, recorded today, including height and weight. To account for this shortcoming in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS). an 11-point scale was developed to code high school senior class yearbook photographs of WLS participants for relative body, mass (RBM). Our analyses show, that although imperfect. the RBM scale is reliable (alpha (sic) 91) and meets several criteria of validity as a measure of body mass. Measured at ages 17 18, the standardized relative body mass index (SRBMI) was moderately correlated (r=31) with body index (BMI) at ages 53 54 and with maximum BMI reported between ages 16 and 30 (r = 48). Overweight adolescents (>= 90th percentile of SRBMI) were about three times more likely than healthy-weight adolescents (10th 80th percentile of SRBMI) to be obese in adulthood and, as a likely, significantly more likely to report health problems such as; chest pain and diabetes. Overweight adolescents also suffered a twofold risk of premature death from all nonaccidental causes as well as a fourfold risk of heart disease mortality. The RBM scale has removed a serious obstacle to obesity research and lifelong analysis of health in the WLS. We suggest that other longitudinal studies may, also he able to obtain photos of participants at younger ages and thus gain a prospectively useful substitute for direct measures of body mass.	3	Eric N.

Ueyama, Mika & Futoshi Yamauchi. 2009. 'Marriage Behavior Response to Prime-age Adult Mortality: Evidence From Malawi.' Demography. 46:1 43-63.	Demography	2009	5	This article examines the effect of AIDS-related mortality, of the prime-age adult population on marriage behavior among women in Malawi. A rise in prime-age adult mortality increases risks associated with the search for a marriage partner in the marriage market. A possible behavioral change in the marriage market in response to an increase in prime-age adult mortality, is to marry earlier to avoid exposure to HIV/AIDS risks. Me test this hypothesis by using micro data from Malawi, where prime-age adult mortality has drastically , increased. In the analysis, we estimate the probability of prime-age adult mortality that sample women have observed during their adolescent period by utilizing retrospective information on deaths of their siblings. Empirical analysis shows that excess prime-age adult mortality in the local marriage market lowers the marriage age for females and shortens the interval between the first sex and first marriage.	2	Mika Ueyama; Futoshi Yamauchi
Rendall, Michael, Mark Handcock & Stefan Jonsson. 2009. 'Bayesian Estimation of Hispanic Fertility Hazards From Survey and Population Data.' Demography. 46:1 65-83.	Demography	2009	1	Previous studies have demonstrated both large gains in efficiency and reductions in bias by incorporating population information in regression estimation with sample survey data. These studies, however, assumed that the population values are exact. This assumption is relaxed here through a Bayesian extension of constrained maximum likelihood estimation applied to U.S. Hispanic fertility. The Bayesian approach allows for the use of both auxiliary survey data and expert judgment in making adjustments to published Hispanic Population fertility rates, and for the estimation of uncertainty about these adjustments. Compared with estimation from sample survey data only, the Bayesian constrained estimator results in much greater precision in the age pattern of the baseline fertility hazard and therefore of the predicted values for any given combination of socioeconomic variables. The use of population data in combination with survey data may therefore be highly advantageous even when the population data are known to have significant levels of nonsampling error.	3	Michael S.

Brown, Susan & Wendy Manning. 2009. 'Family Boundary Ambiguity and the Measurement of Family Structure: the Significance of Cohabitation.' Demography. 46:1 85-101.	Demography	2009	25	We used data from the first wave of the National Longitudinal Stuck of Adolescent Health to examine family boundary ambiguity in adolescent and mother reports of family structure and found that the greater the family complexity, the more likely adolescent and mother reports of family structure were discrepant. This boundary ambiguity in reporting was most pronounced for cohabiting stepfamilies. Among mothers who reported living with a cohabiting partner only one-third of their teenage children also reported residing in a cohabiting stepfamily. Conversely, for those adolescents who reported their family structure as a cohabiting stepfamily just two-thirds of their mothers agreed. Levels of agreement between adolescents and mothers about residing in a two-biological-parent family, single-mother family, or married stepfamily were considerably higher Estimates of the distribution of adolescents across family structures vary according to whether adolescent mother or combined reports are used Moreover the relationship between family structure and family processes differed depending on whose reports of family structure were used and boundary ambiguity was associated with several key family processes. Family boundary ambiguity presents an important measurement challenge for family scholars.	2	Susan L. Brown; Wendy D. Manning

Demography. 46:1 103-125.	Demography	2009	42	In this article we use newly developed statistical methods to examine the generative processes Mal give rise to widespread patterns in friendship networks. The methods incorporate both traditional demographic measures on individuals (age, sex, and race) and network measures for structural processes operating on individual, dyadic, and triadic levels. We apply the methods to adolescent friendship networks in 59 U.S. schools from the National Longitudinal Survey, of Adolescent Health (Add Health). We model friendship formation as a selection process constrained by individuals' sociality (propensity to make friends), selective mixing in dyads (friendships within race, grade, or sex categories are differentially, likely, relative to cross-category friendships), and closure in triads (a friendly friends are more likely, to become friends), given local population composition. Blacks are generally, the most cohesive racial category, although when whites are in the minority, they display stronger selective mixing than do blacks when blacks are in the minority. Hispanics exhibit disassortative selective mixing under certain circumstances; in other cases, they, exhibit assortative mixing but lack the higher order cohesion common in other groups. Grade levels are always highly cohesive, while females form triangles more than males. We conclude with a discussion of how network analysis may, contribute to our understanding of sociodemographic structure and the processes that create it.	3	Steven M. Goodreau; James A.

Demography	2009	11	The 2004 hurricane season was the worst in Florida history,, with four hurricanes causing at least 47 deaths and some \$45 billion in damages. To collect information on the demographic impact of those hurricanes, we surveyed households throughout the state and in the local areas that sustained the greatest damage. We, estimate that one-quarter of Florida's population evacuated prior to tit least one hurricane; in some areas, well over one-half the residents evacuated at least once, and many evacuated several times. Most evacuees stayed with family of friends and were away from home for only a few days. Using logistic regress ion analysis, we found that the strength of the hurricane and the vulnerability of the housing unit had the greatest impact on evacuation behavior additionally, several demographic variables had significant effects on the probability of evacuating and the choice of evacuation lodging (family/friends, public shelters, or hotels/motels). With continued population growth in coastal areas and the apparent increase in hurricane activity caused by global warming, threats posed by hurricanes are rising in the United States and throughout the world We, believe the present study will help government officials plan more effectively for future hurricane evacuations.	2	Stanley K.

Demography	2009	16	This article uses longitudinal data,for, the United States and Great Britain to examine the impact of residential mobility, and childbirth oil the earnings of women, their family, earnings, and the related division of earnings by gender. This project is the first to compare explicitly the impact of childbirth and family migration oil women., earnings. and it extends prior cross sectional and longitudinal studies oil isolated countries by providing a direct contrast between two major using comparable measures. The results indicate that families respond in similar ways in both countries to migration and childbirth. In response to both migration and childbirth, women's earnings fall at the time of the event and recover slowly afterward, but the magnitude of the impact is roughly twice as large for childbirth as for migration. However, migration-but not the birth of a child is also associated with a significant increase in total family, earnings because of increased husbands' earnings. As a result, the effect of migration on the relative earnings of wives to husbands is similar to the effect of childbirth. These results suggest that family migration should he given consideration in the literature on the gender earnings gap.	4	Thomas J. Cooke; Paul Boyle; Kenneth Couch; Peteke Feijten

Demography	2009	6	In the 1990s, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Costa Rica, and Brazil passed dual citizenship laws granting their expatriates the right to naturalize in the receiving country, without losing their nationality of origin. I estimate the effects of these new laws oil naturalization rates and labor market outcomes ill the United States. Based on data from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. censuses, I find that immigrants recently, granted dual nationality rights are more likely to naturalize relative to migrants from other Latin American countries. They also experience relative employment and earnings gains, together with drops in welfare use, suggesting that dual citizenship rights not only, increase the propensity to naturalize hilt may also promote economic assimilation. The effects of dual citizenship oil improved economic performance, if mediated through naturalization, are consistent with American citizenship conferring greater economic opportunities.	1	Francesca Mazzolari
Wingfield, Adia. 2009. 'Racializing the Glass Escalator Reconsidering Men's Experiences With Women's Work.' Gender \& Society. 23:1 5-26.	Gender \& Society	2009	18	Many men who work in women's professions experience a glass escalator effect that facilitates their advancement and upward mobility within these fields. Research finds that subtle aspects of the interactions, norms, and expectations in women's professions push men upward and outward into the higher-status, higher-paying, more ``masculine'' positions within these fields. Although most research includes minority men, little has explicitly considered how racial dynamics color these men's encounters with the mechanisms of the glass escalator. In this article, the author examines how intersections of race and gender combine to shape experiences for minority men in the culturally feminized field of nursing and finds that the upward mobility implied by the glass escalator is not uniformly available to all men who do ``women's work.'' The author concludes that the glass escalator is a racialized concept and a gendered one and considers the implications of this for future studies of men in feminized occupations.	1	Adia Harvey Wingfield
Heath, Melanie. 2009. 'State of Our Unions Marriage Promotion and the Contested Power of Heterosexuality.' Gender \& Society. 23:1 27-48.	Gender \& Society	2009	7	Marriage promotion is a government strategy aimed at ensuring that children are raised in married, heterosexual families, preferably by their biological parents. This article places critical heterosexuality studies in dialogue with feminist state theory to examine marriage promotion as a reaction of the gendered and sexualized state to crisis tendencies of institutionalized heterosexuality. Drawing on the first in-depth study of marriage promotion politics, the author examines polycentric state practices that seek to stabilize the norm of the white, middle-class, heterosexual family. While explicit policy concerns focus on race and class, state-sponsored marriage workshops teach about gender hierarchy to rehearse an implicit ideology of marital heterosexuality. In contrast to feminist state theories that present a monolithic, top-down model of state control, the author offers a more nuanced examination of the relationship between macro and micro levels of power and their uneven consequences for social change.	1	Melanie Heath

Gender \& Society	2009	8	Based on a multiyear study, this article analyzes the reproduction of adult gender segregation in two youth-sports organizations in which most men volunteers become coaches and most women volunteers become ``team moms.'' We use interviews and participant observation to explore how these gender divisions are created. While most participants say the divisions result from individual choices, our interviews show how gendered language, essentialist beliefs, and analogies with gendered divisions of labor in families and work-places naturalize this division of labor. Observation reveals how patterned, informal interactions reproduce ( and occasionally challenge) it as well. We show how ( mostly) nonreflexive informal interactions at the nexus of three gender regimes-youth sports, families, and workplaces-produce a gender formation with two interrelated characteristics: an ascendant professional class gender ideology that we call ``soft essentialism'' and a ``gender category sorting system'' that channels most men into coaching and most women into being ``team moms.''	2	Michael A.

This different type of regular status involves the assumption of identification in a more ethereal subculture, in the context of more rarified time and space anchors. This article examines a specific gaming culture, ``Magic: The Gathering,'' as an emergent and structured sequence of accomplishments in which individual participants and competitors cooperate to create and maintain specialized forms of competition, interaction, and commerce. One coauthor, assuming the identity of Playa', observed the assumption and creation of regular identities that provided a foundation for the ongoing competitive and cooperative sequences and accomplishments.	2	Patrick T.

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	0	This article explores the complex and contradictory dynamics of client resistance to organizational rules and staff definitions in a nonprofit microenterprise development program. Micro-Enterprise, Inc. offers training and small loans to economically disadvantaged individuals who want to operate very small businesses. Although claiming to avoid the judgmental aspects of past social welfare programs, program staff recruited the ``right type'' of client. Individuals who did not conform to these classifications were disadvantaged in the program. Yet, clients were far from passive in these matters. They used fluid and convergent strategies to accommodate, reconstruct, and resist the dominant program discourse. Some strategies were individualistic whereas others were more collective; some strategies produced organizational change; others reinforced negative views of the poor. Over time, concerns about client resistance and funders' perceptions led to a series of program changes. These changes reduced the opportunities for collective client resistance to organizational rules and staff control. These findings also reveal the situated nature of resistance strategies.	3	Nancy C.

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	27	In this article we review ethnographic research on the Internet and computer-mediated communication. The technologically mediated environment prevents researchers from directly observing research participants and often makes the interaction anonymous. In addition, in the online environment direct interaction with participants is replaced by computer-screen data that are largely textual, but may include combinations of textual, visual, aural, and kinetic components. We show how the online environment requires adjustments in how ethnographers define the setting of their research, conduct participant observation and interviews, obtain access to settings and research subjects, and deal with the ethical dilemmas posed by the medium.	4	Angela Cora Garcia; Alecea I.

Blackstone, Amy. 2009. 'Doing Good, Being Good, and the Social Construction of Compassion.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 38:1 85-116.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	2	Activists and volunteers in the United States face the dilemma of having to negotiate the ideals of American individualism with their own acts of compassion. In this article, I consider how activists and volunteers socially construct compassion. Data from ethnographic research in the breast cancer and antirape movements are analyzed. The processes through which compassion is constructed are revealed in participants' actions and in their identities. It is through their actions (or ``doing good'') and their perceptions and presentations of themselves (''being good'') that participants construct compassion as a gendered phenomenon. Together, the processes of doing good and being good raise questions about the extent to which participants' acts of compassion are or can be transformative in a way that promotes the social change which activists and volunteers seek.	1	Amy Blackstone
Purser, Gretchen. 2009. 'the Dignity of Job-seeking Men Boundary Work Among Immigrant Day Laborers.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 38:1 117-139.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2009	6	Drawing on interviews and comparative ethnographic fieldwork in two day labor hiring sites ( a street corner labor market and a ``regulated'' day labor worker center), this article examines the discourses through which Latino immigrant day laborers make sense of, and find dignity within, their ongoing quest for work. My findings reveal a clear pattern of ``boundary work'' along the center/street divide, wherein each group of day laborers asserts its dignity and masculinity by repudiating what they construe to be the feminine submission exemplified by the other group. I argue that gender both shapes and is shaped through the articulation of these moral boundaries and show how workers' struggle to attain dignity-in this case, via strategies of social differentiation and distinction-can act against the formation of a collective identity.	1	Gretchen Purser

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	6	The aim of this paper is to examine variations in the combination of social roles during times of social change. We specify a latent class approach to examine role configurations for individuals in their early 30s, establishing a typology of how work- and family-related roles combine within individuals born 12 years apart and examine their antecedents. Drawing on data collected for two British Birth Cohorts born in 1958 (N = 10,706) and 1970 (N = 11,005), we provide empirical evidence of both consistency and change in life course patterns. Findings are discussed in terms of destandardization, differentiation, and individualization of the life course in times of social change and their implications for family research within a life course perspective.	4	Andy Ross; Ingrid Schoon; Peter Martin; Amanda Sacker
Nomaguchi, Kei. 2009. 'Change in Work-family Conflict Among Employed Parents Between 1977 and 1997.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:1 15-32.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	16	Using data from two national surveys (N = 2,050), this paper examines what accounts for the increase in the sense of work-family conflict among employed parents between 1977 and 1997. Decomposition analysis indicates that the increases in women's labor force participation, college education, time pressure in completing one's job, and the decline in free time were related to the increase. Fathers in dual-earner marriages experienced a particular increase in work-family conflict. With the same amount of time spent with children, parents felt greater work-family conflict in 1997 than in 1977. Although masked by the overall increase, some trends, such as the increases in intrinsic job rewards, time with children, and egalitarian gender attitudes, contributed to a decline in work-family conflict.	1	Kei M.

Dribe, Martin & Maria Stanfors. 2009. 'Does Parenthood Strengthen a Traditional Household Division of Labor? Evidence From Sweden.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:1 33-45.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	14	Parenthood is often considered a major factor behind gender differences in time allocation, especially between paid work and housework. This article investigates the impact of parenthood on men's and women's daily time use in Sweden and how it changed over the 1990s. The analysis is made using time diary data from the Multinational Time Use Survey (MTUS; N = 13,729) and multivariate Tobit regressions. The results indicate that while parenthood in 1990 - 1991 clearly strengthened the traditional gender division of labor in the household, this was much less the case in 2000 - 2001, when parenthood affected men and women in a more similar way.	2	Martin Dribe; Maria Stanfors

Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:1 46-60.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	18	The current study utilized an ecological framework to examine the longitudinal interrelations among Latino adolescents' (N = 323) cultural orientation (i.e., ethnic identity and enculturation), familial ethnic socialization experiences, and generational status. Findings indicated that ethnic identity and enculturation were both predicted by adolescents' generational status, although some of these relations were indirect via the relation between generational status and familial ethnic socialization. Findings underscore the importance of examining the dimensions of cultural orientation independent of one another and considering the central role of familial socialization practices in these processes. Moreover, the current work provides direction for further theoretical work to advance our understanding of the unique aspects of cultural orientation.	4	Adriana J. Umana-Taylor; Edna C.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	22	Family stress theory can explain associations between contextual stressors and parenting. The theory, however, has not been tested among Mexican Americans or expanded to include cultural-contextual risks. This study examined associations between neighborhood, economic, and acculturative stressors and parenting behaviors in a sample of 570 two-parent Mexican American families. Results support the negative impact of economic stress on parenting through parental depressive symptoms. Neighborhood stress influenced fathers' depressive symptoms and parenting, but not mothers'. The effects of acculturative stress were inconsistent. Results suggest that contextual stressors common to Mexican American families impact parenting behaviors through parental depression.	4	Rebecca M. White; Mark W. Roosa; Scott R. Weaver; Rajni L.

Samuels, Gina. 2009. '``being Raised by White People'': Navigating Racial Difference Among Adopted Multiracial Adults.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:1 80-94.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	22	There are increasing numbers of multiracial families created through marriage, adoption, birth, and a growing population of multiracial persons. Multiracials are a hidden but dominant group of transracially adopted children in both the United Kingdom and the United States. This paper introduces findings from an interpretive study of 25 transracially adopted multiracials regarding a set of experiences participants called ``being raised by White people.'' Three aspects of this experience are explored: (1) the centrality yet absence of racial resemblance, (2) navigating discordant parent-child racial experiences, and (3) managing societal perceptions of transracial adoption. Whereas research suggests some parents believe race is less salient for multiracial children than for Black children, this study finds participants experienced highly racialized worlds into adulthood.	1	Gina Miranda Samuels
Zhang, Yuanting & Jennifer Van. 2009. 'Marital Dissolution Among Interracial Couples.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:1 95-107.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	20	Increases in interracial marriage have been interpreted as reflecting reduced social distance among racial and ethnic groups, but little is known about the stability of interracial marriages. Using six panels of Survey of Income and Program Participation (N = 23,139 married couples), we found that interracial marriages are less stable than endogamous marriages, but these findings did not hold up consistently. After controlling for couple characteristics, the risk of divorce or separation among interracial couples was similar to the more-divorce-prone origin group. Although marital dissolution was found to be strongly associated with race or ethnicity, the results failed to provide evidence that interracial marriage per se is associated with an elevated risk of marital dissolution.	2	Yuanting Zhang; Jennifer Van

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	11	This paper examines the role of religion in adolescence for shaping subsequent family formation. Data were drawn from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (N = 13,895). We explored the role of three dimensions of religious life-affiliation, attendance, and religious fervor-both singly and in combination for the transition to either marriage or cohabitation. Although each dimension predicted subsequent union formation, it was the particular combination of these dimensions that was important for understanding the likelihood of cohabiting. We also found evidence that patterns of religious identity, attendance, and fervor in adolescence were associated with the length of cohabitation, the likelihood of the cohabitation ending in marriage, and beliefs about the purpose of cohabitation.	2	David Eggebeen; Jeffrey Dew
Mollborn, Stefanie. 2009. 'Norms About Nonmarital Pregnancy and Willingness to Provide Resources to Unwed Parents.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:1 122-134.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	10	Contested social norms underlie public concern about adults' and teenagers' nonmarital pregnancy. The original, vignette-based National Pregnancy Norms Survey (N = 812) measures these norms and related sanctions. Descriptive analyses report embarrassment at the prospect of a nonmarital pregnancy by age and gender of hypothetical prospective parents and age, race or ethnicity, and socioeconomic status of respondents. Multivariate analyses show that embarrassment about nonmarital pregnancy is frequently weak but much stronger when prospective parents are teenagers. Embarrassment predicts respondents' hypothetical sanctions of a new parent in their family by withholding several types of needed material resources. Because research has shown that such resources affect education and income, this study helps explain how violating norms might lead to negative outcomes among unmarried parents.	1	Stefanie Mollborn

Clustered regression analyses show that, as expected, cohabiting persons have less contact with family members. Results are consistent with the selection perspective, which attributes the lower levels of contact to background characteristics, influencing the orientation of the cohabiting toward family. The uncertainty perspective, which attributes the lower levels of contact with the parents of the partner to the greater uncertainty regarding the stability of cohabiting relationships, is partially supported.	2	Martijn J.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	18	Using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Survey (N = 2,954), a birth cohort study, this work examines how gains in earnings and income are associated with marriage and subsequent childbearing for low-income couples. Using change models, results indicate that positive changes in earnings, controlling for baseline levels of earnings, were associated with greater odds of marriage. Cohabiting couples who became poor were associated with a 37\% decrease in marriage likelihood. Neither earnings nor income was affiliated with additional fertility. Results are consistent with the Financial Expectations and Family Formation theory, which posits that positive economic circumstances are necessary for marriage, but are not associated with subsequent childbearing.	1	Christina M.

Ward, Russell, Glenna Spitze & Glenn Deane. 2009. 'the More the Merrier? Multiple Parent-adult Child Relations.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:1 161-173.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	12	Although parent-adult child ties are generally positive, most parents have multiple children whose relations may yield collective ambivalence combining higher and lower quality. Little research has investigated these multiple relations. NSFH respondents aged 50+ with adult children (N = 2,270) are used to assess patterns of quality and contact across multiple children in the same family. This illuminates mixed experiences, especially for lowest quality and contact across children, contributing to collective ambivalence in parent-adult child relations within families. Having more children increases prevalence of both positive and negative relations. Stepchildren exhibit more negative relations than nonstepchildren, even in the same family. Mothers have more positive but not more negative relations than fathers, but mothers have more negative relations with stepchildren.	3	Russell A. Ward; Glenna Spitze; Glenn Deane
Xie, Yu & Haiyan Zhu. 2009. 'Do Sons or Daughters Give More Money to Parents in Urban China?.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:1 174-186.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	7	The patriarchal structure of the traditional Chinese family suggests that sons, more than daughters, provide financial support to elderly parents. The norm of receiving support in old age primarily from sons, however, may have been undermined by dramatic demographic, economic, and cultural changes occurring over the last several decades in China, especially in urban areas. We examine gender differences in adult children's financial support to parents using a recent data set (''Study of Family Life in Urban China'') collected in 1999 (N = 1,801). The results show that married daughters, especially those living with parents, provide more financial support to parents than married sons do. This significant gender difference can be primarily explained by daughters' resources, such as education and income.	2	Yu Xie; Haiyan Zhu

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	19	This study addresses the hypothesis that the relationship between parental psychological control and autonomy-support depends on how autonomy-support is conceptualized, that is, in terms of promotion of independence or in terms of promotion of volitional functioning. Questionnaires tapping into psychological control and these two types of autonomy-support were administered to a sample of 495 emerging adults. Cluster analysis revealed that, whereas parental promotion of independence may or may not co-occur with psychological control, high parental promotion of volitional functioning systematically goes together with low psychological control and vice versa. Differences between clusters in terms of adjustment were mainly driven by differences in psychological control and promotion of volitional functioning and to a lesser extent by differences in promotion of independence.	3	Bart Soenens; Maarten Vansteenkiste; Eline Sierens

Mobilization	2009	15	Most scholars of social movements agree that since the 1960s protest policing in the United States has decreased in severity. Yet this characterization runs counter to sociolegal arguments that virtually all forms of state social control have become more forceful. We maintain that both of these arguments obfuscate what is really of essence to policing of protest: the character of the protest event and the level of threat posed to police. We examine U. S. protest policing over the 1960-1990 period and show that while it is generally true that aggressive policing is less likely following the 1960s, threatening protests are always policed aggressively, regardless of the period. The findings suggest that general claims about the increasing or decreasing severity of policing over time are less useful than are arguments about the character of the protest event and the level of threat posed to police officers.	2	Sarah A.

Braun, Robert & Rens Vliegenthart. 2009. 'Violent Fan Fluctuations: a Diffusion Perspective to Explain Supporters' Violence.' Mobilization. 14:1 23-44.	Mobilization	2009	4	In this article, we address the question of how diffusion mechanisms predict the level of violence among soccer fans. We embed possible causes of violent fan behavior in a theoretical framework of diffusion, as social movement scholars deploy it to study other instances of collective violence. Four possible diffusion explanations are examined: social status of transmitters (both other fan-sides as well as soccer players), status similarity of adopter and transmitter, direct ties as captured by geographical distance, and indirect ties as measured by media coverage. These explanations are tested for the occurrence of violence around soccer matches in the Netherlands during the period 2001-2005. We employ a pooled complementary log-log analysis of fourteen teams over two hundred match weeks and control for repression, city size, and several match characteristics. We find considerable evidence for three of the four proposed explanations and demonstrate that aggressive play on the pitch, hooliganism by fan-sides with similar status, and media coverage are significant explanatory factors for the evolution of fan violence.	2	Robert Braun; Rens Vliegenthart

Mobilization	2009	5	Research on movement political success has grown measurably, yet few studies consider the role of framing in bringing about challenger victories. Existing investigations taking collective action framing into account typically consider only whether movement frames with broad cultural resonance are more convincing to policymakers. This study examines other qualities of movement frames to uncover argumentative forms that allow activists to persuade lawmakers to alter policy. I examine efforts by organized U.S. women in the early twentieth century to persuade state legislators to broaden jury laws to seat women jurors. Quantitative analyses reveal that jury frames that (a) define the problem of excluding women as serious and broad in scope, (b) provide a clear rationale for supporting activist demands, and (c) offer concrete evidence to support the frame's claim are likelier to convince lawmakers. The status of the frame's articulators and the quantity of movement framing are not predictors of movement success.	1	Holly J. McCammon
Valocchi, Stephen. 2009. 'the Importance of Being ``we'': Collective Identity and the Mobilizing Work of Progressive Activists in Hartford, Connecticut.' Mobilization. 14:1 65-84.	Mobilization	2009	3	This article examines the ways that collective identity influences the mobilizing work activists perform in a wide variety of progressive activities in Hartford, Connecticut, as reported in open-ended life history interviews. Using a collective identity typology based on ideology, organization, and biography, the analysis demonstrates the variety of ways in which these different ``group allegiances'' affect how activists raise consciousness, choose strategies and goals, pursue allies, and build coalitions. These myriad differences in mobilizing by activists with different collective identities within the same movement sector speak to the flexibility of social movement structures and to the importance of activist identity in maneuvering within those structures.	1	Stephen Valocchi
Inclan, Maria. 2009. 'Sliding Doors of Opportunity: Zapatistas and Their Cycle of Protest.' Mobilization. 14:1 85-106.	Mobilization	2009	2	Using a cross-sectional time-series event-count model, this study analyzes the effects of local, national, and international variables on pro-Zapatista protests across the 111 localities (municipios) of Chiapas over a ten-year period (1994-2003). Protests were more likely to occur in localities with previous protest activity, a closed political system, and a larger presence of the military. Local and national electoral openings, as well as a larger local and national presence of the Zapatistas' presumed political ally, the Partido de la Revolucion Democratica (PRD), had a negative relationship with protest activity. Specific openings to the Zapatistas also worked as protest depressants. International attention did not show any significant effect on Zapatista protest activity. However, these institutional and specific openings were only ephemeral opportunities in that they did not translate into substantive concessions for the movement. They appear to have decreased the strength of the Zapatista protest cycle, while the international attention to the movement did not show any significant effect on it.	1	Maria Inclan
Zhao, Dingxin. 2009. 'Organization and Place in the Anti-us Chinese Student Protests After the 1999 Belgrade Embassy Bombing.' Mobilization. 14:1 107-129.	Mobilization	2009	0	While early studies of participant mobilization in contentious politics stress the roles of organizations and networks in mobilization, more recent scholarship emphasizes the importance of place. This article treats organization-based mobilization and place-based mobilization as two mechanisms of participant mobilization and tries to find a way to understand the relationships between them. By examining different styles of student mobilization during the 1999 anti-U.S. protests at three Beijing universities, each with similarly built environments and spatial student routines, this article shows that the built environment played a crucial role in student mobilizations where there was less organizational involvement, and a small role when mobilization processes were more organized. In short, less-organized protests may be compelled to rely on placed-based mobilization tactics.	1	Dingxin Zhao
Lizardo, Omar & Sara Skiles. 2009. 'Highbrow Omnivorousness on the Small Screen? Cultural Industry Systems and Patterns of Cultural Choice in Europe.' Poetics. 37:1 1-23.	Poetics	2009	12	To date, Peterson and Kern's (1996) ``highbrow omnivorousness'' hypothesis has been examined mainly for the case of musical taste. In this paper we attempt to extend this framework to a relatively unexplored cultural domain, that of television consumption. Using data from the 2001 Eurobarometer we hypothesize that highbrows will be more likely to consume a wide variety of other forms of popular culture, namely television programming. The results fail to unambiguously confirm the highbrow omnivorousness hypothesis: in some EU countries, highbrows consume a wider variety of television programming than nonhighbrows, in other countries, highbrows are indistinguishable from non-highbrows, while in a third group of countries, highbrows arc snobbier than non-highbrows in their television consumption choices. We attempt to explain this cross-national heterogeneity in the hi ghbrow/non-highbrow difference in television consumption using DiMaggio's (1977) organizational theory of culture production. In our ``contingent highbrow omnivorousness'' framework, we propose that in commercialized, profit-oriented cultural industry systems. highbrow snobbery rather than omnivorousness will be the norm. In relatively less commercialized, profit-oriented contexts, highbrow the snobbery effect will be weaker. Classifying countries by the degree of market orientation of the television production field yields results that are consistent with this hypothesis.	2	Omar Lizardo; Sara Skiles
Crossley, Nick. 2009. 'the Man Whose Web Expanded: Network Dynamics in Manchester's Post/punk Music Scene 1976-1980.' Poetics. 37:1 24-49.	Poetics	2009	10	The Manchester (UK) music scene has been extremely important in the development of independent and alternative music within Europe. As such it has been the topic of two major films. It is commonly held that the Manchester scene `took off' in the late 1970s. This paper observes that its `take off' was facilitated by the formation of a network between a critical mass of key social actors. The aim of the paper is to demonstrate this process of network formation and to seek to contribute to its explanation by identifying the key mechanisms (of network formation) involved. The paper uses formal social network analysis to map the network in question and to demonstrate its growth. It uses a more straightforward historical-sociological approach, which is qualitative and archival in nature, to identify the salient mechanisms. The paper adds an interesting and important case study to the existing literature on music scenes and also suggests a novel way for both advancing research on music scenes and further extending the use of social network analysis (and network analytic concepts) in relation to the arts. Finally, it makes an important empirical contribution to the newly emerging area of `network dynamics'.	1	Nick Crossley
Kopiez, Reinhard, Andreas Lehmann & Janina Klassen. 2009. 'Clara Schumann's Collection of Playbills: a Historiometric Analysis of Life-span Development, Mobility, and Repertoire Canonization.' Poetics. 37:1 50-73.	Poetics	2009	1	Clara Schumann's (1819-1896) important influence on concert life and piano performance throughout the 19th century can still be felt in our times. Virtually all concerts Clara gave between 1828 (at age 9) and 1891 (at age 71) are documented in a historically unique collection of over 1300 printed concert program leaflets (playbills). Combining an historiometric approach with musicological methods, we analyzed those data descriptively and theoretically from the perspective of repertoire canonization. The aim of this study was to document details of Clara's life-time career as a concert pianist, to study her repertoire development in the context of critical life events and personal aesthetic beliefs, and to establish some first comparisons with data from other performers of the time. This study complements existing research on programming and canonization by explaining the cumulative effects of an individual performer's programming decisions. First, the playbills were entered into a database and prepared for computer-assisted analysis. From the 20,000 program entries we extracted those 536 solo piano and chamber music pieces which Clara had performed. Analyses showed that the yearly frequency of concerts reflected her personal circumstances and critical life events. Although Clara performed works by almost 40 composers, the most frequently performed four composers (R. Schumann, Mendelssohn, Beethoven, and Chopin) comprised 70\% of all performances. Furthermore, although she performed in 160 cities, 50\% of her concerts took place in only seven major cities which represented international (London, Leipzig, Vienna) and national (Berlin, Dresden, Hamburg, Frankfurt) music centers. Finally, her influential role in the canonization of classical piano music can be explained by biographical circumstances which resulted in particular choices of traditionalist repertoire after Robert Schumann's death (1856). This included decreasing program diversity after 1870 and the avoidance of contemporary composers, such as Liszt, Brahms, Grieg, Tchaikovsky or Saint-Saens.	3	Reinhard Kopiez; Andreas C.

Poetics	2009	5	This article examines how curriculum content in secondary education has developed at the meso- and micro-levels. It does so via the case of Dutch literary education between 1968 and 2000. Textbooks and teachers may wish to focus on literary authors because of their alleged artistic merits or rather strive for literary authors considered likable by students. To examine this issue, we analyze the content of textbooks as well as teachers' usage of them. Results show author representation in textbooks increasingly resembles students' reading preferences at the expense of selections made by literary experts. At the same time, teachers have increasingly adopted textbooks that regarded students' preferences the most. These trends seem to be the result of changes in the student population rather than teachers' professional characteristics.	2	Marc Verboord; Kees Rees

Population Research and Policy Review	2009	2	Dynamic social networks, a key concept in modern social science research, are beginning to play a major role in understanding the ways in which individuals and communities respond to disasters. The authors of this paper review the relevant theory and research regarding how crises cause change in social networks, and how those changes may or may not facilitate recovery, as a function of the kinds of changes that occur. It applies the In/Out/Seeker/Provider (IOSP) framework to identify categories in which we might study disasters and the impact both on the networks and the impacts to the networks. This paper details options for applying social network analysis to research of both pre- and post-disaster settings and concludes by framing a research agenda for the future study of the dynamics of network change following a disaster.	4	Danielle M.

Population Research and Policy Review	2009	2	We assess governmental and non-governmental responses to disasters using primary data of Hurricane Katrina survivors along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Non-governmental sources include nonprofit relief groups, faith-based organizations, and survivors' self-identified social networks. We assess the impact of these governmental and non-governmental relief efforts on survivors' economic, psychological, physical, and social effects from the disaster. Our results show that social isolation significantly increases perceptions of disaster disturbance and decreases perceived rates of disaster relief. Additionally, survivors perceive that social networks provide greater sources of psychological, financial and social disaster relief than government sources. However, survivors' social networks decay sharply in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, and they do not appear to fully recover a year from the disaster. These social networks themselves are not fully resilient to a disaster.	4	Richard Forgette; Bryan Dettrey; Mark Van; David A. Swanson
Hori, Makiko, Mark Schafer & David Bowman. 2009. 'Displacement Dynamics in Southern Louisiana After Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:1 45-65.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	6	We describe displacement dynamics in Louisiana approximately 1 year after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Policy-makers and service-providers require a more detailed understanding of displacement in order to provide for geographically dispersed populations. Census estimates of net change are often insufficient because they fail to capture the broad range of movement of people. Therefore, we draw upon original data to more fully describe patterns of movement across and within parish lines in southern Louisiana. The 2006 Louisiana Health and Population Survey (LHPS) was commissioned by the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals and the Louisiana Recovery Authority to provide information on population dispersion and related health characteristics in and around hurricane-affected regions. Our paper utilizes this unique dataset to describe three distinct dimensions of displacement dynamics: in-migration, out-migration, and intra-parish movement. These displacement dynamics add important correctives to the broader ``net effects'' commonly cited in media reports of population changes, which vastly understate the extent of displacement in the region.	3	Makiko Hori; Mark J.

The post-disaster context meant that experience from traditional survey methods often did not apply. Comparisons of advantages and disadvantages associated with each sampling method serve to inform future post-disaster research and illuminate the limits of classical research methods.	6	Tammy L.

Population Research and Policy Review	2009	1	Conducting research in the wake of a catastrophic event imposes the dual responsibilities on researchers of protecting the rights of the survivors as research subjects, while also ensuring research quality and the dissemination and application of findings. This article, based partially on the authors' experiences of conducting research in school districts following Hurricane Katrina, examines the ethical issues that arise when working with survivors, reticent organizations, and institutional review boards. Challenges experienced by researchers concerning access, informed consent, confidentiality, subject compensation, and enlisting the assistance of stressed institutions are described.	3	Carrie Y.

Lindner, Andrew. 2009. 'Among the Troops: Seeing the Iraq War Through Three Journalistic Vantage Points.' Social Problems. 56:1 21-48.	Social Problems	2009	1	During Operation Iraqi Freedom, the Pentagon introduced a program ``embedding'' journalists in military units. Embedded reporters have been widely criticized for allegedly failing to adequately cover effects of the war on Iraqi civilians, while over-emphasizing the personal lives of troops. Proponents of the embedding program argue that the program provides journalists with a detailed understanding of military culture and life on the frontline. In addition to the embedded reporters, some journalists were stationed in Baghdad and others were independent and free to roam. I argue that these three journalistic vantage points channeled reporters toward particular news content, while limiting their access to others. I hypothesize that while embedded reporters effectively presented the military experience of the war and the Baghdad-stationed reporters successfully covered the Iraqi experience of the war, the independent reporters were able to provide the most balanced coverage of the war. I demonstrate that despite the largely one-sided story presented, articles by embedded journalists were both more prominent and more widely available than coverage from other vantage points. Due to the dominance of embedded reporting, I conclude by noting that the majority of war coverage in print media heavily emphasized the soldier's experience of the war, while downplaying the effects of the invasion on the Iraqi people. By conducting a content analysis of 742 print news articles by 156 journalists from the major combat period of the war, this study offers one of the first systematic documentations of the substantive content of Iraq war coverage.	1	Andrew M.

Roscigno, Vincent, Diana Karafin & Griff Tester. 2009. 'the Complexities and Processes of Racial Housing Discrimination.' Social Problems. 56:1 49-69.	Social Problems	2009	11	Housing represents an important arena within which racial inequalities continue to manifest-a fact highlighted in housing audit studies and the substantial literature on racial residential segregation. In this article, we extend the insights of prior work by: (1) denoting the wide range of ``exclusionary'' discriminatory practices that transpire at distinct stages of the rental/sales process and that are too varied to be captured by any singular audit design; (2) analyzing something that audits simply cannot, namely discrimination that occurs within already established housing arrangements (i.e., nonexclusionary discrimination). We draw from qualitative and quantitative data truly unique to the literature, reflecting approximately 750 instances of housing discrimination discrimination verified by civil rights investigators following state and federal guidelines. Quantitative patterns denote unique and disparate vulnerability, especially for African American women, and the centrality of powerful institutional (i.e., banks, realtors, insurance companies, etc.) and more proximate actors (i.e., landlords and neighbors) in reifying racial disadvantage. Landlords are clearly on the ``front line'' with regard to both exclusionary and nonexclusionary forms. Neighbors, realtors, banks, and mortgage companies play a role as well, more or less, depending on the form of discrimination being examined. Qualitative immersion into case materials offers important insight on relevant processes pertaining to victim vulnerability and status, and how discriminatory actions themselves occur. We conclude by discussing the implications of our arguments and findings for future analyses of race and housing inequality, and for understanding stratification and its microinteractional dimensions generally.	3	Vincent J.

Ramirez, Hernan & Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo. 2009. 'Mexican Immigrant Gardeners: Entrepreneurs or Exploited Workers?.' Social Problems. 56:1 70-88.	Social Problems	2009	16	Suburban maintenance gardening is one service sector that has grown in the United States, and in many parts of the country it has become a gendered occupational niche for Mexican immigrant men. What is the social organization of this occupation and to what extent are Mexican immigrant gardeners following in the footsteps of Japanese gardeners, achieving socioeconomic mobility through gardening? Based on interviews conducted with 47 Mexican immigrant maintenance gardeners in Los Angeles, this article examines the occupational structure of this informal sector job, the social context in which it has developed, the mix of informal and formal economic transactions involved, and the strategic challenges that gardeners negotiate. The data show that there is occupational differentiation and mobility within the gardening occupation, and that mobility in the job remains dependent on combining both ethnic entrepreneurship and subjugated service work. Gendered social and human capital, together with financial and legal capital are necessary for occupational mobility. Jardineria, or suburban maintenance gardening, is analogous to the longstanding labor incorporation of female immigrant domestic workers into affluent households, but it is also indicative of a new trend: the proliferation of hybrid forms of entrepreneurship and service work and the incorporation of masculine ``dirty work'' service jobs into affluent households.	2	Hernan Ramirez; Pierrette Hondagneu-Sotelo
Simi, Pete & Robert Futrell. 2009. 'Negotiating White Power Activist Stigma.' Social Problems. 56:1 89-110.	Social Problems	2009	5	This article uses extensive ethnographic data on the U. S. white power movement ( WPM) to describe the interactional aspects of managing activist stigma in everyday settings. We describe their stigma management as a form of everyday resistance. In the face of strong cultural codes against extreme racism, they conceal their Aryan identity to avoid the constant ire, indignation, and conflict they face from others. But, concealing their activist identity creates dissonance, which they work out by exploiting opportunities to selectively disclose features of their racist self. Disclosing aspects of their Aryan self while covering the more extreme aspects creates some expressive balance, which activists experience as resistance to social constraints on identity and self-expression that they perceive. We explain variances in the degree to which WPM members conceal and disclose their identity by focusing on structural differences in the common, everyday settings of family, work, school, and other public contexts.	2	Pete Simi; Robert Futrell

Social Problems	2009	19	This paper analyzes strategies used by women in a collegiate, male-defined sport (rugby) to deal with identity dilemmas. Players challenged conventional notions of passive femininity through tough play, yet encountered sexist and homophobic stigma from outsiders. Rather than resisting and rejecting the power of this stigma, they engaged in defensive othering-subordinates distancing themselves from other subordinates and reinforcing the legitimacy of a devalued identity in the process. Specifically, the women identified with dominants, engaged in normative identification, and propped up dominants. Their identity work resulted in a ``heterosexy-fit'' identity that ultimately reinforced heterosexism and gender inequality.	1	Matthew B. Ezzell
Grattet, Ryken. 2009. 'the Urban Ecology of Bias Crime: a Study of Disorganized and Defended Neighborhoods.' Social Problems. 56:1 132-150.	Social Problems	2009	5	This article examines the neighborhood characteristics that affect bias crime and compares bias crime to other kinds of criminal offending. Two frequently asserted arguments are tested. The first argument is that bias crime is like other criminal offenses in that it is more likely to occur in communities with high levels of social disorganization. The second argument is that bias crime is unique in that it occurs as a defense against neighborhood in-migration of ethnic ``others''-the so-called ``defended neighborhoods'' argument. Findings show that accounting for the spatial distribution of bias crime requires both perspectives. Bias crime, like robbery, assault, and vandalism, is more likely to occur in neighborhoods with concentrated disadvantage and residential turnover, two of the three factors identified in social disorganization research. However, unlike other kinds of crime, holding constant attributes of disorganization, the effect of nonwhite in-migration on bias crime is greater in neighborhoods with a high percentage of white residents than communities with a low percentage of white residents. This confirms the central empirical implication of the defended neighborhoods perspective. Additional analyses show that these effects hold in analyses of specifically anti-black bias crimes and violent bias crimes. The conclusion suggests that research on social problems like bias crime should balance the emphasis on the unique features of the problem with attention to the common generative processes that the problem shares with a wider set of behaviors and outcomes.	1	Ryken Grattet
McQueeney, Krista. 2009. '``we Are God's Children, Y'all:'' Race, Gender, and Sexuality in Lesbian- and Gay-affirming Congregations.' Social Problems. 56:1 151-173.	Social Problems	2009	14	This article examines how lesbian, gay, and straight-but-affirming members of lesbian- and gay-affirming churches in the South challenged a deep-rooted Christian belief in homosexual sin. Data are taken from 200 hours of participant observation and 25 in-depth interviews in two Protestant churches: one predominantly black, working class, lesbian, and evangelical, and the other mostly white, middle class, heterosexual, and liberal. I identify three strategies lesbian, gay, and straight-but-affirming church members used to accommodate-but not assimilate-to heteronormative conceptions of the ``good Christian.'' First, some black lesbians minimized their sexuality as secondary to the Christian identity. Second, most lesbian and gay members-both black and white-normalized their sexuality by enacting Christian morals of monogamy, manhood, and motherhood. Third, a small group of black lesbian/gay and white, straight-but-affirming members moralized their sexuality as grounds for challenging homophobia in the church. Using these strategies, church members both resisted notions of homosexual sin and reproduced a ``politics of respectability'' (Warner 1999) among lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) people. Findings shed empirical light on two issues in the social problems literature: (1) the inseparability of race and gender from sexual identity; and (2) the importance of an intersectional analysis in assessing the possibilities of faith-based strategies for sexual equality.	1	Krista McQueeney
Hughes, Melanie. 2009. 'Armed Conflict, International Linkages, and Women's Parliamentary Representation in Developing Nations.' Social Problems. 56:1 174-204.	Social Problems	2009	9	Politics is arguably the arena in which gender inequality remains most pronounced. Yet in recent decades, women in some countries and regions of the world have made significant gains in legislative presence at the national level. But for women living outside of the industrialized West, we know little about the processes that facilitate their entry into politics. Through separate analyses of 36 high-income, 86 middle-income, and 63 low-income countries, I demonstrate that past models of women's political representation fail to explain variation across low-income samples. Using multiple methods, I also explore two sets of factors that may be more salient predictors of women's parliamentary representation in low-income nations: civil war and international linkages. Although historically women have been unable to consolidate gains made during wartime into post-conflict political representation, I find that certain types of civil conflict during the 1980s and 1990s positively affect women's representation in low-income nations. Longer, larger-scale wars that contest the political system or serve to alter the composition of the government have the best prospects for creating opportunities for women to gain parliamentary seats. Brief case studies of women, war, and social change in Rwanda, Mozambique, Uganda, and Tajikistan suggest that structural and cultural mechanisms may work in conjunction with political openings to produce post-conflict gains in women's political presence. Both women's lack of political representation and the tragic effects of civil war remain enduring challenges faced by the developing world, but at the intersection of these two problems, there is hope for women seeking political access.	1	Melanie M.

Teasdale, Brent & Eric Silver. 2009. 'Neighborhoods and Self-control: Toward an Expanded View of Socialization.' Social Problems. 56:1 205-222.	Social Problems	2009	9	In this article we develop and test a multi-level theory of the sources of self-control among adolescents. We argue that neighborhoods are an important structural source of self-control. We test this idea using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 9,171). Results from a multilevel structural equation model indicate that neighborhood disadvantage is a significant predictor of adolescent self-control, controlling for demographics, family characteristics, and social integration. Implications for future research on the role of neighborhood context in the development of self-control among youth are discussed. In addition, we discuss the implications for policy of multilevel theorizing.	2	Brent Teasdale; Eric Silver
Brown, Keith, Doris Hamner, Susan Foley & Jonathan Woodring. 2009. 'Doing Disability: Disability Formations in the Search for Work.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:1 3-24.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	0	Disability theorists have spent much time discussing how disability is defined. The theoretical roots for these debates reside in the medical, structural, and minority models of disability. The medical model views disability as equivalent to a functional impairment; the minority model sees a lack of equal rights as a primary impediment to social equality between able and disabled populations; and the structural model looks to environmental factors as the cause of disability. While debates over how to define disability are informative, there is currently an insufficient amount of empirical research looking at how people come to identify themselves as having a disability. Rather than focus on how disability is (or should be) defined, herein we look at how disability identities are constructed as people search for work. We show that people's interactions with employers and employment agencies have important influences on how disability identities are constructed. We borrow from the ``doing gender'' and ``racial formations'' paradigms to introduce an interactive approach to looking at how disability identities are constructed. We introduce the concept of disability formation to highlight how disability identities are continually negotiated through interactions with employment agencies and employers. Our findings are based on focus groups with 58 people who self-identified as having a disability and were working or searching for work.	4	Keith Brown; Doris Hamner; Susan Foley; Jonathan Woodring
Kwan, Samantha. 2009. 'Framing the Fat Body: Contested Meanings Between Government, Activists, and Industry.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:1 25-50.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	14	Sociologists have long recognized that social problems do not derive solely from objective conditions but from a process of collective definition. At the core of some social issues are framing competitions, struggles over the production of ideas and meanings. This article examines competing cultural meanings about the fat body. Through frame analysis of organizational materials, I map the contested field of obesity and document three cultural frames-medical frame, social justice frame, and market choice frame-as represented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance (NAAFA), and the food industry group the Center for Consumer Freedom (CCF), respectively. Using the ``framing matrix,'' I explore each frame's key signature elements and discuss its social and cultural significance. Notably, each frame leads to different outcomes for social equality and how society thinks about fat bodies, health, and public policy.	1	Samantha Kwan
Miller, Amy. 2009. '``midwife to Myself'': Birth Narratives Among Women Choosing Unassisted Homebirth.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:1 51-74.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	4	Most pregnant women in the United States today choose a normative physician-guided pregnancy followed by a medically managed hospital birth. Some, however, choose the care of a midwife during pregnancy and birth, whether in the hospital or, more rarely, at home. Despite growing research on both these paths, a third option chosen by some women has rarely been studied: a planned birth at home with neither a doctor nor a midwife assisting. In this article, I examine the stories told by women in this under-researched population to consider how they make and explain this highly unusual choice. Analysis of online birth stories and in-depth interviews with women who planned and had an unassisted homebirth reveal ways in which these women rely on competing discourses of midwifery and medicine to craft a unique sense of agency in birth.	1	Amy Chasteen Miller
Schafer, Markus. 2009. 'Parental Death and Subjective Age: Indelible Imprints From Early in the Life Course?.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:1 75-97.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	3	Past research suggests that sustaining a young identity helps adults maintain a greater sense of well-being. The experience of subjective aging, however, is not a spontaneous phenomenon, but stems from lifelong developmental experiences. Drawing from writings on the life course and self-concept, I consider how parental death in childhood shapes subjective age in adulthood. To examine the effects of maternal and paternal death on subjective age, I employ the Midlife Development in the United States Study (MIDUS). A series of linear regression analyses indicates that maternal death during childhood is associated with an older subjective age in adulthood, death of a father does not have a similar influence on subjective age, and that the effect on subjective age is stronger if maternal death occurred during childhood than during other periods of the life course. The findings highlight interconnections between timing of transitions in the life course, linked lives, and the development of self-concept. Subjective age in adulthood seems to hinge on important biographical experiences from childhood, such as parental death, though the processes differ by the gender of the deceased parent.	1	Markus H.

Ignatow, Gabriel. 2009. '``introduction: Self and Emotion.''.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:1 98-114.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	9	Though Pierre Bourdieu has been criticized for ignoring the moral dimensions of social judgments, I suggest that his habitus concept can provide a useful theoretical foundation for a sociological analysis of morality. If the habitus is revised in a way that recognizes the embodied nature of cognition, it can be treated as a foundation for moral judgments of the self and of others. A revised habitus concept can account for two processes by which moral judgments are shaped by social settings: (1) cultural influences on feelings and expressions of emotion; and (2) the ways moral metaphors are structured by embodied cognitive schemas. In both processes, universal bodily operations are employed in different configurations across cultural settings. I argue that a modified habitus concept that can account for these phenomena has significant implications for the sociological analysis of lay morality.	1	Gabriel Ignatow
Hendley, Alexandra. 2009. 'Barreras Del Lenguaje: Children's Negotiation of Adult-created Exclusionary Practices.' Sociological Inquiry. 79:1 115-134.	Sociological Inquiry	2009	0	This article explores the effects of language differences on dynamics among youth athletes. Fifteen hours of participant observation were conducted with a youth soccer team, supplemented by five interviews with the coach and with players' parents. With a cohort consisting of a Spanish- and English-speaking bilingual coach, one fully bilingual player and another partly bilingual player, two Spanish-only-speaking players, and four English-only-speaking players, there were opportunities for many different types of interactions. This article specifically focuses on how language differences served as a catalyst for the creation of exclusionary practices by the adults surrounding the team. However, these practices did not determine the team's culture; rather, there was both accommodation and resistance on the part of the players to those practices of exclusion that the adults had introduced.	1	Alexandra Hendley
Schonlau, Matthias, Arthur Soest, Arie Kapteyn & Mick Couper. 2009. 'Selection Bias in Web Surveys and the Use of Propensity Scores.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 37:3 291-318.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	16	Web surveys are a popular survey mode, but the subpopulation with Internet access may not represent the population of interest. The authors investigate whether adjusting using weights or matching on a small set of variables makes the distributions of target variables representative of the population. This application has a rich sampling design; the Internet sample is part of an existing probability sample, the Health and Retirement Study, that is representative of the U. S. population aged 50 and older. For the dichotomous variables investigated, the adjustment helps. On average, the sample means in the Internet access sample differ by 6.5 percent before and 3.7 percent after adjustment. Still, a large number of adjusted estimates remain significantly different from their target estimates based on the complete sample. This casts doubt on the common procedure to use only a few variables to correct for the selectivity of convenience samples.	4	Matthias Schonlau; Arthur Soest; Arie Kapteyn; Mick Couper
Lee, Sunghee & Richard Valliant. 2009. 'Estimation for Volunteer Panel Web Surveys Using Propensity Score Adjustment and Calibration Adjustment.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 37:3 319-343.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	12	A combination of propensity score and calibration adjustment is shown to reduce bias in volunteer panel Web surveys. In this combination, the design weights are adjusted by propensity scores to correct for selection bias due to nonrandomized sampling. These adjusted weights are then calibrated to control totals for the target population and correct for coverage bias. The final set of weights is comprised of multiple components, and the estimator of a total no longer takes a linear form. Therefore, approximate methods are needed to derive variance estimates. This study compares three variance estimation methods through simulation. The first method resembles what is used in commercial statistical software based on squared residuals. The second approach uses a variance estimator originally derived for the generalized regression estimator. The third method uses jackknife replication. Results indicate bias reduction is crucial for valid variance estimation and favor the replication method over the other approaches.	2	Sunghee Lee; Richard Valliant
Shropshire, Kevin, James Hawdon & James Witte. 2009. 'Web Survey Design Balancing Measurement, Response, and Topical Interest.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 37:3 344-370.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	5	Using data from Survey2001, we analyze how visual images embedded in a web-based survey can ( 1) reduce nonresponse in the specific case that a respondent prematurely terminates the survey and ( 2) preserve measurement validity. Page-by-page progression through the survey is modeled as a survival process with early termination seen as failure. While images had no apparent effect on the termination process, respondent interest in the survey topic was linked to early termination. These results highlight the importance of placing interest-related questions early in the survey to better control for the effects of interest-driven attrition. Moreover, these findings suggest that an interactional information system approach, one that not only collects data but also pushes relevant information to respondents, may serve to generate or maintain interest and in the process reduce survey attrition.	3	Kevin O.

Sociological Methods \& Research. 37:3 371-392.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	3	In this article, an information-processing perspective is used to explore the impact of response categories on the answers respondents provide in Web surveys. Response categories have a significant effect on response formulation in questions that are difficult to process, whereas in easier questions ( where responses are based on direct recall) the response scales have a smaller effect. In general, people with less cognitive sophistication are more affected by contextual cues. The Need for Cognition and the Need to Evaluate indexes for motivation account for a significant part of the variance in survey responding. Interactions of ability to process information and motivation combine in regulating responses for questions that are more difficult to process. The results hint at a substantial role of satisficing in Web surveys.	4	Vera Toepoel; Corrie Vis; Marcel Das; Arthur Soest
Christian, Leah, Nicholas Parsons & Don Dillman. 2009. 'Designing Scalar Questions for Web Surveys.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 37:3 393-425.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	7	This paper explores how the visual design of scalar questions influences responses in web surveys. We present the results of five experiments embedded in two web surveys of university students. We find that consistently presenting the positive end of the scale first did not impact responses but increases response times. Displaying the categories in multiple columns influence how respondents process the scale and increase response times. Separating the midpoint, ``don't know'' option, or endpoints spatially does not impact responses when the visual and conceptual midpoint align. Removing the graphical layout of the scale influences responses when lower numbers indicate more positive categories and increases response time. Finally, response times are longer for polar point scales with numeric labels, but there are no differences in responses. Overall, our results suggest that the visual design of response scales impacts measurement, but that some manipulations produce larger and more significant differences than others.	3	Leah Melani Christian; Nicholas L.

Raento, Mika, Antti Oulasvirta & Nathan Eagle. 2009. 'Smartphones an Emerging Tool for Social Scientists.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 37:3 426-454.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2009	27	Recent developments in mobile technologies have produced a new kind of device: a programmable mobile phone, the smartphone. In this article, the authors argue that the technological and social characteristics of this device make it a useful tool in social sciences, particularly sociology, social psychology, urban studies, technology assessment, and media studies. The device is willingly carried by a large fraction of people in developed countries, integrates a number of technologies for automatic observation, can be programmed to interact with the user, and can communicate with remote researchers. This allows unobtrusive and cost-effective access to previously inaccessible sources of data on everyday social behavior, such as physical proximity of people, phone calls, and patterns of movement. The authors describe three studies in human behavior that have augmented existing methods with the smartphone, two of which the authors conducted themselves. Based on their experience, the authors critically evaluate the improvements and threats to validity and reliability of smartphone-augmented methods. These approaches are rapidly becoming feasible for the social scientist, since research software for smartphones have been published in open source, which lowers the technical and economic investment needed for their utilization in research.	3	Mika Raento; Antti Oulasvirta; Nathan Eagle

Work and Occupations	2009	13	An analysis is conducted as to whether social class position matters for the negative change in subjective well-being experienced from unemployment. Theory on work identification and work conditions is used to formulate hypotheses on the differential impact on well-being of entering unemployment from different social classes. Data are analyzed from 14 waves of the British Household Panel Survey, and fixed effects methods are used. Main results are that the negative effect of job loss on subjective well-being is highest for individuals who are in the middle classes prior to becoming unemployed.	1	Signe Hald Andersen
Sengupta, Sukanya, Paul Edwards & Chin-Ju Tsai. 2009. 'the Good, the Bad, and the Ordinary Work Identities in ``good'' and ``bad'' Jobs in the United Kingdom.' Work and Occupations. 36:1 26-55.	Work and Occupations	2009	13	Much debate exists about postbureaucratic organizational forms that are sometimes felt to strengthen the polarization between good and bad jobs. Small firms provide one test in that they lack bureaucracy. Such firms from two contrasting sectors, food manufacture and the media, are used to assess, respectively, the models of good and bad jobs. Data from 66 firms and 203 employees show a mixed picture: Food jobs are bad for pay but relatively good for autonomy. Media jobs offer autonomy, but this is constrained by tight performance demands and low pay. These results help to explain why national surveys find no polarization in terms of autonomy and are explained by the economic contingencies of the two sectors. Ordinariness rather than stark polarization is the key picture.	3	Sukanya Sengupta; Paul K. Edwards; Chin-Ju Tsai

Work and Occupations	2009	1	Work and employment scholars interested in jobs and workers at the lower end of the labor market have much to learn from a recent set of volumes authored by policy scholars. These volumes focus on how shifts in the macroeconomy, work supports, and postsecondary education affect the wellbeing of workers both on and off the job. This essay identifies some of the more subtle contributions of these volumes to knowledge on the nature of employment. It explains how many of the analyses could benefit, however, from additional consideration of the jobs low-earners perform. The essay concludes by offering specific suggestions for incorporating additional measures of job conditions into policy-relevant research.	1	Susan J. Lambert
Fernandez-Mateo, Isabel. 2009. 'Cumulative Gender Disadvantage in Contract Employment.' American Journal of Sociology. 114:4 871-923.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	13	Women's wages do not grow with experience or tenure as much as men's do. Many accounts of this cumulative gender disadvantage attribute it to women's underinvestment in firm-specific skills. Yet if that were true, this disadvantage would not exist where firm-specific skills are not rewarded by the labor market. This article investigates this argument in the context of contract employment, where demand for firm specificity is minimal. Contrary to expectations, men still receive higher rewards than women over time. Drawing on quantitative evidence and qualitative fieldwork using job histories of high-skill contractors affiliated with a staffing firm, the author finds support for two sources of women's disadvantage: lower rates of movement across clients on the supply side and unmeasured demand-side factors by which similar levels of tenure and client transitions accrue lower rewards to women. Implications for research on gender stratification and career advancement in non-formalized labor markets are discussed.	1	Isabel Fernandez-Mateo

American Journal of Sociology	2009	40	Data from 44 societies are used to explore sex segregation by field of study. Contrary to accounts linking socioeconomic modernization to a ``degendering'' of public-sphere institutions, sex typing of curricular fields is stronger in more economically developed contexts. The authors argue that two cultural forces combine in advanced industrial societies to create a new sort of sex segregation regime. The first is gender-essentialist ideology, which has proven to be extremely resilient even in the most liberal-egalitarian of contexts; the second is self-expressive value systems, which create opportunities and incentives for the expression of ``gendered selves.'' Multivariate analyses suggest that structural features of postindustrial labor markets and modern educational systems support the cultivation, realization, and display of gender-specific curricular affinities.	2	Maria Charles; Karen Bradley

American Journal of Sociology	2009	19	In the sociological literature on social mobility, the long-standing convention has been to assume that intergenerational reproduction takes one of two forms: a categorical form that has parents passing on a big-class position to their children or a gradational form that has parents passing on their socioeconomic standing. These approaches ignore in their own ways the important role that occupations play in transferring opportunities from one generation to the next. In new analyses of nationally representative data from the United States, Sweden, Germany, and Japan, the authors show that (a) occupations are an important conduit for social reproduction, (b) the most extreme rigidities in the mobility regime are only revealed when analyses are carried out at the occupational level, and (c) much of what shows up as big-class reproduction in conventional mobility analyses is in fact occupational reproduction in disguise.	5	Jan O.

Moller, Stephanie, Arthur Alderson & Francois Nielsen. 2009. 'Changing Patterns of Income Inequality in Us Counties, 1970-2000.' American Journal of Sociology. 114:4 1037-1101.	American Journal of Sociology	2009	16	The upswing in economic inequality that has affected a number of advanced industrial societies in the late 20th century has been particularly conspicuous in the United States. The authors explore its causes using data on the distribution of family income in 3,098 U. S. counties in 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000. The authors build a model of within-county income inequality that assumes that distribution processes involving labor market and sociodemographic variables operate primarily at the county level and those involving the political and institutional context operate primarily at the state level. Multi-level methods are used to distinguish county cross-sectional, state cross-sectional, and longitudinal effects on inequality. The authors find that, when features of the state-level institutional and political context are associated with inequality, these effects are larger longitudinally than cross-sectionally. A range of other factors, including economic development, labor force changes, shifts in the racial/ethnic and gender composition of the labor force, educational expansion, and urbanization are found to have comparatively large effects, both longitudinally and cross-sectionally.	3	Stephanie Moller; Arthur S.

Parker, Stephen. 2010. 'Research in Fowler's Faith Development Theory: a Review Article.' Review of Religious Research. 51:3 233-252.	Review of Religious Research	2010	1	This article reviews and evaluates the nature and extent of the empirical research on Fowler's faith development theory. It describes Fowler's theory of faith development and reviews the operational measures for determining faith stages. It concludes that only the broad contours of Fowler's theory have adequate empirical support. In general, the more structural-developmental dimensions of faith development theory have received more empirical support than the psychosocial dimensions. Several of the claims central to faith development theory lack conclusive empirical support at present.	1	Stephen Parker
Stolz, Joerg. 2010. 'a Silent Battle: Theorizing the Effects of Competition Between Churches and Secular Institutions.' Review of Religious Research. 51:3 253-276.	Review of Religious Research	2010	9	This paper proposes a theory of religious and secular competition, focusing specifically on western democracies. The article shows that a wide variety of empirically observed phenomena can be explained as aggregated outcomes of individual rational adaptations to different states of competition between religious and secular institutions. The theory presented builds on a new typology of church goods, the concept of ``social production functions,'' and the distinction of two types of competition between the religious and the secular Among the examples that are accounted for by the theory are shortages of priests, waves of disaffiliations, drops in church attendance even of committed members, high religiosity in the USA and in agrarian countries and others. I conclude with methodological suggestions for future empirical research.	1	Joerg Stolz
Jelen, Ted & Linda Lockett. 2010. 'American Clergy on Evolution and Creationism.' Review of Religious Research. 51:3 277-287.	Review of Religious Research	2010	2	Beliefs about evolution and the teaching of creationism among Evangelical Protestant, Mainline Protestant, and Roman Catholic clergy are compared. We hypothesize that Evangelical ministers will be less supportive of evolution than either Mainline clergy or Catholic priests, and that the attitudinal correlates of beliefs about evolution will be similar for all three groups. We also hypothesize that support for teaching creationism will be more pronounced among Evangelical ministers, but that the sources of such support will be similar across religious groups. All hypotheses were confirmed, except that beliefs in the inerrancy of the Bible, or concerning beliefs about evolution, are not related to support for teaching creationism among Catholic priests.	2	Ted G.

Jung, Dietrich. 2010. '``islam as a Problem'': Dutch Religious Politics in the East Indies.' Review of Religious Research. 51:3 288-301.	Review of Religious Research	2010	0	The article analyzes Dutch colonial policies in Indonesia in light of current debates about the (in)compatibility of Islam and modern democracy. The focus is on the work and life of Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje (1857-1936), who was simultaneously colonial advisor and the Netherlands' leading orientalist, and founding father of modern Islamic studies. The article investigates his way of dealing with the politicization of Islam in the Dutch East Indies and his attempt to combine counter-insurgency measures with modern institution-building in the early twentieth century. It argues that contemporary debates about the (in) compatibility of Islam and modernity are still premised on the sociological ideas and the image of Islam as a religion that have guided both Hurgronje's scholarly work and his colonial policies.	1	Dietrich Jung
Palmer-Boyes, Ashley. 2010. 'the Latino Catholic Parish as a Specialist Organization: Distinguishing Characteristics.' Review of Religious Research. 51:3 302-323.	Review of Religious Research	2010	1	With the vast majority of Latinos in the U.S. claiming Catholic affiliation, the growing presence of this ethnic group has a significant impact on typical parish life. Using the framework of organizational ecology, I describe the Latino parish as a cultural and immigrant specialist organization distinct from the Anglo parish. As a cultural specialist, the parish provides for certain normative aspects of religious life brought from Latin America including charismatic worship practices, and to a lesser extent, the practice of popular religiosity. As immigrant specialists, Latino parishes are distinct from Anglo parishes demographically and in the types of auxiliary and social service group supported by the parish. Females, children, and adults from single-parent households comprise a greater share of regular Latino parish participants, while Anglo parishes serve a greater number of adults from intact families. Group and service provision tends to reflect an inward focus at Latino parishes, and an outward one at Anglo parishes. However, both parish types are equally likely to support social programs directed specifically at immigrants.	1	Ashley Palmer-Boyes
Schwadel, Philip. 2010. 'Jewish Teenagers' Syncretism.' Review of Religious Research. 51:3 324-332.	Review of Religious Research	2010	0	With the rapid rise of Jewish interfaith marriage and the migration of Jews away from traditional Jewish neighborhoods, many Jewish teenagers in the U.S. have little interaction with other Jews and little exposure to the Jewish religion. Here I use National Study of Youth and Religion survey data to examine Jewish teenagers' syncretism or acceptance of different religious forms. The results show that Jewish teens are more syncretic than other teens, and that variations in religious activity, an emphasis on personal religiosity, and living in an interfaith home explain some of the difference in syncretism between Jewish and non-Jewish teens. Among Jewish teens, low levels of religious observance, having few opportunities to interact with other Jews, living in an interfaith home, and lack of an emphasis on personal religiosity are each positively correlated with syncretism. I conclude by discussing the implications of Jewish teenagers' syncretism in a pluralistic, predominantly Christian nation.	1	Philip Schwadel
Molnar, Joseph. 2010. 'Climate Change and Societal Response: Livelihoods, Communities, and the Environment.' Rural Sociology. 75:1 1-16.	Rural Sociology	2010	7	P>Climate change may be considered a natural disaster evolving in slow motion on a global scale. Increasing storm intensities, shifting rainfall patterns, melting glaciers, rising sea levels, and other manifold alterations are being experienced around the world. Climate has never been constant in any location, but human-induced changes associated with greenhouse gases and fossil fuel use are new and rapidly shifting conditions for rural communities and regions across the planet. Rural sociologists have long been carving out the contours of this topic through research on family well-being, rural livelihoods, community, and the environment. Now climate change and subsequent policy responses present a new and fundamental source of social change. The purpose of this article is to assess lines of research and theory that consider and direct our understanding of the impacts of climate change, the ways it might be mitigated, and the coping strategies of rural people and communities that are both victims and perpetrators in the global realignment. As climate-change impacts and policy responses begin to impinge on rural populations, the first line of resistance and participation will be the rural community. The distribution of rewards from climate-change mitigation is broad and diffuse; the distribution of costs, compromised livelihoods, and community disruption often is focused.	1	Joseph J. Molnar
Gellert, Paul. 2010. 'Extractive Regimes: Toward a Better Understanding of Indonesian Development.' Rural Sociology. 75:1 28-57.	Rural Sociology	2010	2	P>This article proposes the concept of an extractive regime to understand Indonesia's developmental trajectory from 1966 to 1998. The concept contributes to world-systems, globalization, and commodity-based approaches to understanding peripheral development. An extractive regime is defined by its reliance on extraction of multiple natural resources in the formation of an economic and political order that is also supported by global and regional forces. After elaborating the concept of an extractive regime, the article illustrates it through examination of Indonesia's developmental trajectory from its formation in the post-World War II era to its firm establishment during Suharto's New Order. Although a comprehensive study would necessitate attention to the full panoply of commodities, the study illustrates some of the workings of the extractive regime in the timber and fisheries sectors, which share spatial extensivity and other characteristics. The article concludes by considering the future of the extractive regime in Indonesia amid democratization and continued class domination and by offering suggestions for further application, specification, and extension of the extractive regime concept.	1	Paul K.

Chi, Guangqing. 2010. 'the Impacts of Highway Expansion on Population Change: an Integrated Spatial Approach.' Rural Sociology. 75:1 58-89.	Rural Sociology	2010	6	P>The effects of highways on transforming human society and promoting population change have been investigated in several disciplines, including geography, sociology, economics, and planning. Currently, the primary highway construction activity in the nation is highway expansion; however, this expansion has not been the focus of much of the existing literature. This research examines the role that highway expansion plays in the process of population change. Specifically, this research proposes an integrated spatial regression approach to study the impacts of highway expansion on population change in the 1980s and 1990s in Wisconsin at the minor civil division level. The integrated approach thoroughly considers the factors that influence population change, appropriately examines the spatial variations of their impacts, simultaneously incorporates spatial lag and spatial error dependence, and systematically selects the optimal neighborhood structure. The findings suggest that the impacts of highway expansion on population change differ across rural, suburban, and urban areas: There are only indirect effects in rural areas, both direct and indirect effects in suburban areas, and no statistically significant effects in urban areas. Overall, highway expansion serves as a facilitator of population change within the framework of growth pole theory and location theory.	1	Guangqing Chi
Foulkes, Matt & Kai Schafft. 2010. 'the Impact of Migration on Poverty Concentrations in the United States, 1995-2000.' Rural Sociology. 75:1 90-110.	Rural Sociology	2010	5	P>Poverty is frequently conceptualized as an attribute of either people or places. Yet residential movement of poor people can redistribute poverty across places, affecting and reshaping the spatial concentration of economic disadvantage. In this article, we utilize 1995 to 2000 county-to-county migration data from the 2000 United States decennial census to explore how differential migration rates of the poor and nonpoor affect local incidence of poverty, and how migration reconfigures poverty rates across metropolitan, micropolitan, and noncore counties. We further examine the impact of differential migration rates on African American and Latino poverty rates, two groups that have experienced higher than average poverty rates and have a sizable presence in rural areas. Our analysis indicates that during the 1990s the poor moved at rates equal to or greater than the nonpoor, and that, especially in micropolitan counties, this movement tended to deepen existing poverty concentrations. Both African American and Latino migration patterns tended to reinforce existing poverty concentrations, a result similar to that of the population as a whole, although the migration patterns of both groups more severely exacerbated poverty in high-poverty noncore counties.	2	Matt Foulkes; Kai A.

Bell, Shannon & Richard York. 2010. 'Community Economic Identity: the Coal Industry and Ideology Construction in West Virginia.' Rural Sociology. 75:1 111-143.	Rural Sociology	2010	16	P>Economic changes and the machinations of the treadmill of production have dramatically reduced the number of jobs provided by extractive industries, such as mining and timber, in the United States and other affluent nations in the post-World War II era. As the importance of these industries to national, regional, and local economies wanes, community resistance to ecologically and socially destructive industry practices threatens the political power of corporations engaged in natural-resource extraction. Here we argue that to maintain their power (and profits) as their contribution to employment declines, extractive industries have increased their efforts to maintain and amplify the extent to which the ``economic identity'' of communities is connected with the industry that was historically an important source of employment. We fit this argument within the neo-Marxian theoretical tradition, which emphasizes the roles ideology and legitimation play in maintaining elite rule. We illustrate this theorized process by analyzing the efforts of the West Virginia coal industry, which, through its (faux) ``grassroots'' front group ``Friends of Coal,'' attempts to construct the image that West Virginia's economy and cultural identity are centered on coal production. Our analysis relies on content analysis of various sources and on experience gained from field research. We find that key strategies of the Friends of Coal include efforts to become pervasively visible in the social landscape and the appropriation of cultural icons that exploit the hegemonic masculinity of the region. These findings have implications for how industries around the country, and the world, work to maintain their power through ideological manipulation.	2	Shannon Elizabeth Bell; Richard York
Wollebaek, Dag. 2010. 'Volatility and Growth in Populations of Rural Associations.' Rural Sociology. 75:1 144-166.	Rural Sociology	2010	2	P>This article uses unique community-level data aggregated from censuses of associations to analyze growth and volatility in rural populations of grassroots associations. A qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) shows that the two main paths to growth were (1) centralization in polycephalous (multicentered) municipalities and (2) population growth in secular municipalities. High volatility occurs in (1) societies exposed to metropolitan sprawl and (2) traditional peripheral communities with high organizational density and little sociocultural change. Despite this volatility, associational life expanded in the sprawling areas that underwent extensive sociocultural change as well as in the peripheral areas where centralization took place. By contrast, more static peripheries experienced decline. The findings challenge romanticized images of stable, small-scale communities and nuance the negative view on metropolitan sprawl.	1	Dag Wollebaek

Andersen, Karen. 2010. 'Irish Secularization and Religious Identities: Evidence of an Emerging New Catholic Habitus.' Social Compass. 57:1 15-39.	Social Compass	2010	2	The author identifies major changes since the 1960s that have transformed the role of religion in Irish society. An analysis of Irish data from the 2006 survey ``Church and Religion in an Enlarged Europe'' reveal that these have culminated in a shift in the religious and spiritual identities of young Irish Catholics aged 18-29. This shift is linked to a decline in the power of the Catholic Church in Ireland within education, social welfare, public policy and the media, and its subsequent demise as the sole arbiter of private morality. Rather than having turned to new spiritual expressions, young Irish Catholics embody a new Catholic habitus. Although they still have a strong cultural attachment to Catholicism they exercise a great deal of autonomy in their religious practices, beliefs and attitudes, and their ways of being religious and spiritual appear less institutionalized than older cohorts.	1	Karen Andersen
Gross, Martine & Andrew Yip. 2010. 'Living Spirituality and Sexuality: a Comparison of Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Christians in France and Britain.' Social Compass. 57:1 40-59.	Social Compass	2010	0	Drawing upon two conceptually and methodologically related projects in France and Britain, the authors illuminate lesbian, gay and bisexual Christians' religious orientations, beliefs and practices. The samples demonstrated striking similarities and differences. Participants generally strongly disagreed with the Church's censorious teachings on non-heterosexuality, but the British sample appeared more critical. The French sample also experienced a greater degree of psychological and social dissociation. Nevertheless, some participants across samples stayed within homophobic religious structures because of their commitment to integrating their sexuality and spirituality, and to making religious communities more inclusive. This commitment was buttressed by: (1) their conceptualization of the all-loving God and of Jesus Christ as a transgressive champion of social justice; (2) positive personal experiences; (3) the marginalization of church authority in their moral universe; and (4) increasing theological, social and political capital. Theoretically, the authors contribute to debates on contemporary religious and spiritual landscape and identity.	2	Martine Gross; Andrew K. Yip
Nagy, Peter. 2010. 'Education and Religiosity in Budapest at the Millennium.' Social Compass. 57:1 60-82.	Social Compass	2010	2	During State Socialism, Budapest residents gradually lost their religiosity. For each social group, the loss was always most radically felt among the more educated. During the decades of party-state rule, the place of religious education in schools was taken over by religious education in church (this was partly due to strong political pressure). The only parents who did not send their children to classes in religious education (either in church or in school) were those who had previously become secularized. Since the change of regime, attitudes toward religion have become one of the most fundamental political cleavages. Budapest is a metropolis whose middle classes are fairly secularized, but whose intellectual elite is sharply divided into a secularized atheistic majority and a minority that is overtly religious and assigns political value to its views.	1	Peter Tibor Nagy
Kalkandjieva, Daniela. 2010. 'the Bulgarian Orthodox Church and the ``ethic of Capitalism''.' Social Compass. 57:1 83-99.	Social Compass	2010	0	The author attempts to explore the relationship between Orthodox Christianity and the ``ethic of capitalism'' in Bulgarian society. According to the author, the notion of Orthodoxy as a source of the economic backwardness of Bulgaria is a complex result of historical, institutional and epistemological factors such as the impact of nineteenth-century socio-economic dynamics on the institutionalization of the Bulgarian Church, the symbiosis of Orthodoxy with Balkan nationalism, the difficulty of distinguishing between the doctrinal and institutional aspects of Orthodoxy, and the post-communist reading of Orthodoxy as a factor in the economic liberalization of Bulgaria. The author considers that in the Bulgarian case the ethic of capitalism was developed under the influence of Western economics rather than under that of Orthodoxy. It also brought about a specific secularization of society that allowed the appropriation of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church for national ends.	1	Daniela Kalkandjieva

Smith, Buster. 2010. 'Acceptance of Other Religions in the United States: an Hlm Analysis of Variability Across Congregations.' Social Compass. 57:1 127-142.	Social Compass	2010	4	Interactions with people who are different become more common and significant as the world becomes more closely connected, both physically and culturally. One of the ways in which such cultural collisions are most deeply felt is over matters of religion. The author explores the importance of religious traditions in sculpting the attitudes religious people hold toward the validity of alternative faiths. By employing the statistical techniques of hierarchical linear modeling (HLM), the current analysis is able to combine prior explanations of individual-level behavior with the contextual effects of the religious congregation, such as strictness, racial homogeneity, and membership size. This is accomplished with the 2001 United States Congregational Life Survey. Results indicate that all religions have distinct ways of influencing the relationship between socio-demographic characteristics and pluralistic attitudes, but that more particular features of the congregation are only sporadically significant.	1	Buster G.

Their aging corporeal experiences allow me to examine ageist notions about aging and being old and to explore how this thinking, which valorizes youthfulness, shapes their aging experiences.	1	Kathleen F.

Webster, Murray & Lisa Rashotte. 2010. 'Behavior, Expectations and Status.' Social Forces. 88:3 1021-1049.	Social Forces	2010	5	We predict effects of behavior patterns and status on performance expectations and group inequality using an integrated theory developed by Fisek, Berger and Norman (1991). We next test those predictions using new experimental techniques we developed to control behavior patterns as independent variables. In a 10-condition experiment, predictions accounted for about 72 percent of variance in the data, with closer fit for women than for men. The gender difference may be related to features of the experiment, especially to the experimental design that counters cultural gender prescriptions in some conditions. We suggest ways to improve the experiment by more precisely separating behavior from inferred performance competence in later research. Applications include using behavior to reduce undesirable effects of status generalization.	2	Murray Webster; Lisa Slattery Rashotte

Social Forces	2010	5	This article analyzes the determinants of innovation and success of innovation in the field of U.S. symphony orchestras from 1879 through 1959: why did major orchestras (N = 27) innovate by introducing works of new composers to the repertoire instead of sticking to canonical pieces? Can organizational processes account for the selection and the popularization of new composers in the repertoire? By integrating field theory and organizational theory, this analysis shows that orchestra and musical director consecration and local elite cohesiveness favored innovative programming. Composers introduced by consecrated actors and entering the repertoire at a time of low competition with established composers and high field-level innovation were more likely to survive in the repertoire and have their works performed frequently. These effects became magnified throughout composers' careers.	1	Pierre-Antoine Kremp

Social Forces	2010	2	We replicate and extend John Shelton Reed's classic work on regional identification by examining and modeling the prevalence of the words ``Dixie'' and ``Southern'' in business names across 100 cities and four decades. We find that the instances of ``Dixie'' have dropped precipitously, although identification with the word ``Southern'' has remained more constant, providing evidence of a trend we term re-southernization. We also find that the relative number of blacks in the population provides the most consistent explanation of regional identity. Population density has also emerged as a significant predictor of regional identification in more recent time periods. These findings contribute to the literature on regional identification, the politics of naming and the sociology of the South.	2	Christopher A. Cooper; H. Gibbs Knotts

In this article, however, we propose that collective silences be thought of as a rich and promising arena through which to understand how groups deal with their collective pasts. In so doing, we explore two types of silence: overt silence and covert silence, and suggest that each may be used to enhance either memory or forgetting. We illustrate our conceptual scheme using data on the commemoration of slain Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.	2	Vered Vinitzky-Seroussi; Chana Teeger
Clark, Rob. 2010. 'World-system Mobility and Economic Growth, 1980-2000.' Social Forces. 88:3 1123-1151.	Social Forces	2010	10	World-system scholars have traditionally emphasized the stability of the core/periphery hierarchy. However, prior network studies employing both categorical and continuous measures of world-system position reveal substantial mobility across time, whereby a number of developing states have become more integrated in the world economy over the past several decades. The developmental impact generated by such mobility remains unexplored. Using data on all commodities in the world trade network, I examine the presence and economic impact of world-system mobility across 110 states during the 1980-2000 period. First, I show that the continued upward mobility of ``middle-tier'' states from East Asia and the semiperiphery no longer contributes to the long-term trend of trade convergence, but began producing divergence during the final decades of the 20(th) century. Second, using difference models that control for lagged values, I find that world-system mobility positively affects economic growth, net of initial world-system position, capital and labor inputs, and other regional and economic characteristics. In fact, the magnitude of mobility's effect is substantially larger than that of initial world-system position and second only to initial human capital. These findings support a range of perspectives that are collectively useful for understanding the rapid economic growth of emerging states.	1	Rob Clark
Kaya, Yunus. 2010. 'Globalization and Industrialization in 64 Developing Countries, 1980-2003.' Social Forces. 88:3 1153-1182.	Social Forces	2010	1	This study investigates the effect of the latest wave of economic globalization on manufacturing employment in developing countries. It revisits the classic debate on the effect of internal and external influences on industrialization, and extends this debate to contemporary developing countries. In the process, it assesses the evidence for development/productivity, world systems/dependency and globalization explanations, and uses a comprehensive dataset on 64 developing countries from 1980 through 2003. The results generally show that manufacturing employment increased in most developing countries. First, this study finds that the level of economic development measured by gross domestic product per capita is the most important factor influencing the size of manufacturing employment. Second, economic globalization also influences manufacturing employment in developing countries, but mainly through trade. The size of exports and low-technology exports have a significant positive effect on manufacturing employment in developing countries. Finally, the analysis provides limited support for world systems/dependency theories. Raw materials exports do not significantly influence manufacturing employment while foreign direct investment has a negative impact in some models. This study concludes that the latest wave of economic globalization contributed to the expansion of manufacturing employment in developing countries, although it is not the most significant factor shaping the size of manufacturing employment in these countries.	1	Yunus Kaya
Barrett, Deborah, Charles Kurzman & Suzanne Shanahan. 2010. 'for Export Only: Diffusion Professionals and Population Policy.' Social Forces. 88:3 1183-1207.	Social Forces	2010	1	Export-only diffusion occurs when innovators do not adopt an innovation themselves, but rather promote it to others for adoption. Potential adopters do not take their cues from early adopters, but rather from diffusion professionals who make it their job to spread a practice or institution. The global spread of national-level, population-control policies during the Cold War is one such instance: developed and promoted by wealthy countries that did not themselves adopt such policies, they came to be widespread among poorer countries, thanks in large part to the mobilization of diffusion professionals. This article offers an analytical account of this diffusion, as well as an event-history analysis of 163 countries over the period 1950-1990 demonstrating the importance of linkages between policy adopters and the non-adopting institutions of diffusion professionals.	3	Deborah Barrett; Charles Kurzman; Suzanne Shanahan
Zhao, Ruohui & Liqun Cao. 2010. 'Social Change and Anomie: a Cross-national Study.' Social Forces. 88:3 1209-1229.	Social Forces	2010	5	We apply Durkheim's social transitional theory to explain the variation of anomie in 30 nations in the world. Combining data from two sources the 1995 World Values Survey and the United Nations University's World Income Inequality Database or WIID - we test the hypothesis that rapid sociopolitical change at the structural level disrupts social integration and regulation, and increases the level of anomie among individuals in a society. Using the multilevel approach that permits the decomposition of variance within and between nations, the results of the analyses confirm that rapid sociopolitical change at the macro level, such as the political transition from totalitarianism to democracy, produces a higher level of anomie among individuals in a society. In addition, we find a cross-level effect of confidence in authority on anomie. Findings at the individual level are largely consistent with Merton's theory of anomie and with the extant literature that anomie is inversely related to an individual's social and economic position in a society.	2	Ruohui Zhao; Liqun Cao
Lee, Cheol-Sung & Andrew Schrank. 2010. 'Incubating Innovation or Cultivating Corruption? the Developmental State and the Life Sciences in Asia.' Social Forces. 88:3 1231-1255.	Social Forces	2010	3	A substantial body of literature purports to document the growth of scientific misconduct in Northeast Asia. This article traces the apparent growth of research fraud and falsification to two distinct features of the national innovation systems common to the region: liberal research regimes adopted by developmental states and marked by freedom from government oversight, and illiberal laboratory cultures imported from Germany and marked by all-powerful lab directors and their vulnerable underlings. Based on comparative, qualitative case studies of pioneering countries in bio-medical research, as well as cross-national quantitative analyses of the permissiveness of national stem-cell research policies, we argue that Asia's scientific pathologies are the products of two institutional factors: funding and freedom offered to scientists by developmental states, and the lack of informal control prevalent in the German model of higher education. We conclude that, while Northeast Asian officials offer their biomedical researchers funding and freedom to take advantage of opportunities that rarely exist in the West, their scientists stifle open debate and criticism, and thereby hinder the growth of informal as well as formal control mechanisms that are critical for deterring and detecting scientific fraud.	2	Cheol-Sung Lee; Andrew Schrank

Social Forces	2010	3	This study uses survey data for 2004 on the general public (N = 788) and public officials (N = 791) in the young post-communist democracy of Estonia to examine individual-level determinants of corruption. The results indicate that both public officials and citizens are more likely to engage in corruption when they do not define corruption as wrong, and when they perceive that corrupt behavior is widespread among their peers. This social learning effect becomes statistically insignificant for those citizens who are extorted. The results provide no support for the most common argument on corruption and compliance that people are more likely to engage in corruption when they are distrustful of their fellow citizens or of government.	1	Margit Tavits

Social Forces	2010	5	This article argues that unemployment benefits are providing a crucial but often overlooked function by reducing the insecurity associated with modern labor markets. Because job insecurity is associated with concerns about future financial security, economic support during unemployment may lessen the negative effects of job insecurity on employed individuals' well-being. Using data from the European Social Survey, this article shows that the generosity of unemployment benefits makes a difference to the subjective well-being of employed individuals, especially those with limited economic resources and an insecure position in the labor market. These results indicate that unemployment benefits may be viewed as a collective resource with important external benefits, i.e., benefits to society over and above those to the unemployed who directly utilize such benefits.	1	Ola Sjoberg
Bygren, Magnus & Ryszard Szulkin. 2010. 'Ethnic Environment During Childhood and the Educational Attainment of Immigrant Children in Sweden.' Social Forces. 88:3 1305-1329.	Social Forces	2010	3	We ask whether ethnic residential segregation influences the future educational careers of children of immigrants in Sweden. We use a dataset comprising a cohort of children who finished compulsory school in 1995 (n = 6,560). We follow these children retrospectively to 1990 to measure neighborhood characteristics during late childhood, and prospectively through 2003 to measure the number of years of education attained thus far. The largest immigrant groups came from Finland, Turkey, former Yugoslavia, Iran and Chile. Our empirical analysis reveals that immigrant children who grow up in neighborhoods with many young coethnics who have limited educational resources, obtain relatively low average grades from compulsory school, and on average, do not attain the same levels of education as do immigrant children who grow up elsewhere. For a minority of immigrant children who lived in neighborhoods with educationally successful young coethnics, we find a positive effect of growing up in an ethnic enclave. Also in this case, the effect of the ethnic environment on future educational attainment is mediated by school results in compulsory school.	2	Magnus Bygren; Ryszard Szulkin
Mood, Carina. 2010. 'Neighborhood Social Influence and Welfare Receipt in Sweden: a Panel Data Analysis.' Social Forces. 88:3 1331-1356.	Social Forces	2010	3	This article places the choice to claim welfare benefits in a social context by studying how neighborhood welfare receipt affects welfare receipt among couples in Stockholm, Sweden. It is expected that the propensity to claim welfare should increase with welfare use in the neighborhood, primarily through stigma reduction and increasing availability of information. 1 use individual-level panel data (N = 1,595,843) for the Stockholm County population during the 1990s, data that contain a wide range of information and allow extensive controls for observed and unobserved confounding factors. The results from pooled and fixed-effects logistic regressions suggest that welfare receipt among people in the same neighborhood substantially increases the number of households entering the welfare system (inflow), but the effects on outflow are negligible.	1	Carina Mood
Felson, Richard & Paul-Philippe Pare. 2010. 'Gun Cultures or Honor Cultures? Explaining Regional and Race Differences in Weapon Carrying.' Social Forces. 88:3 1357-1378.	Social Forces	2010	6	We use the National Violence against Women (and Men) Survey to examine the effects of region and race on the tendency to carry weapons for protection. We find that Southern and Western whites are much more likely than Northern whites to carry guns for self-protection, controlling for their risk of victimization. The difference between Southern and Northern whites is particularly strong for women. We do not find much evidence for regional/race differences in carrying knives or mace. These findings provide support for the idea that regional differences in weapon carrying reflect a gun culture rather than an honor culture. We see more evidence of an honor culture among blacks: they are more likely than whites to carry knives as well as guns, controlling for their risk of victimization.	2	Richard B.

Warren, John & Caitlin Hamrock. 2010. 'the Effect of Minimum Wage Rates on High School Completion.' Social Forces. 88:3 1379-1392.	Social Forces	2010	1	Does increasing the minimum wage reduce the high school completion rate? Previous research has suffered from (1. narrow time horizons, (2. potentially inadequate measures of states' high school completion rates, and (3. potentially inadequate measures of minimum wage rates. Overcoming each of these limitations, we analyze the impact of changes in state and federal minimum wage rates on state high school completion rates for the graduating classes of 1982 through 2005. Our state-level analyses, which consist of a series of state and year fixed-effects models with controls for state-year time-varying covariates, provide no support for the argument that increasing the minimum wage reduces rates of high school completion.	2	John Robert Warren; Caitlin Hamrock
Shihadeh, Edward & Raymond Barranco. 2010. 'Latino Employment and Black Violence: the Unintended Consequence of Us Immigration Policy.' Social Forces. 88:3 1393-1420.	Social Forces	2010	11	U.S. immigration policies after 1965 fueled a rise in the Latino population and, thus, increased the competition for low-skill jobs. We examine whether Latino immigration and Latino dominance of low-skill industries increases black urban violence. Using city-level data for the year 2000, we find that (1. Latino immigration is positively linked to urban black violence, (2. the link is most prevalent where blacks lost ground to Latinos in low-skill markets, (3. not all low-skill sectors operate in unison; black violence rises only when jobs in agriculture, manufacturing and construction are in short supply and, (4. Latino immigration raises black violence by first increasing black unemployment. We discuss the implications of these findings.	2	Edward S. Shihadeh; Raymond E. Barranco
Parrado, Emilio & William Kandel. 2010. 'Hispanic Population Growth and Rural Income Inequality.' Social Forces. 88:3 1421-1450.	Social Forces	2010	1	We analyze the relationship between Hispanic population growth and changes in U.S. rural income inequality from 1990 through 2000. Applying comparative approaches used for urban areas we disentangle Hispanic population growth's contribution to inequality by comparing and statistically modeling changes in the family income Gini coefficient across four rural county types: established Hispanic, rapidly growing Hispanic, rapidly growing non-Hispanic, and slow-growth or declining counties. Results support perspectives that stress growing social heterogeneity for understanding the contribution of minority population growth to inequality, including changes in human capital and industrial restructuring. We find remarkably similar inequality growth across rapidly growing Hispanic and non-Hispanic counties. This suggests that growing rural inequality stems largely from economic expansion and population growth rather than changing Hispanic composition.	2	Emilio A. Parrado; William A. Kandel
Feniger, Yariv & Ephraim Yuchtman-Yaar. 2010. 'Risk Groups in Exposure to Terror: the Case of Israel's Citizens.' Social Forces. 88:3 1451-1462.	Social Forces	2010	0	This research addresses a largely ignored question in the study of terror: who are its likely victims? An answer was sought through analysis of comprehensive data on civilian victims of terror in Israel from 1993 through 2003. The chances of being killed in seemingly random terror attacks were found unequally distributed in Israeli society, but the weaker sectors were not the most vulnerable. This pattern may be attributed to the perpetration of most terror attacks in public places, where members of underprivileged groups are less likely to be. Paradoxically, ethnic segregation, gender and other forms of social exclusion and inequality may have helped to protect marginalized social groups from the risk of terror victimization.	2	Yariv Feniger; Ephraim Yuchtman-Yaar
Kleiner, Sibyl & Eliza Pavalko. 2010. 'Clocking In: the Organization of Work Time and Health in the United States.' Social Forces. 88:3 1463-1486.	Social Forces	2010	5	This article assesses the health implications of emerging patterns in the organization of work time. Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979, we examine general mental and physical health (SF-12 scores), psychological distress (CESD score), clinical levels of obesity, and the presence of medical conditions, at age 40. Overall, we find that health varies more across work hours than across types of shifts, and part-time workers report worse physical and emotional health than full-time workers. However, controlling for individual, family and job characteristics explains the poorer health observed among part-time workers. Those who are satisfied with their jobs, have more education, or have an employed spouse, report better health, while women and those with a prior health limitation report worse health. After taking these factors into account, we find a curvilinear relationship between work hours and health, with those working between 40 and 59 hours per week reporting worse mental and physical health than those working 40 hours per week. We also find that obesity differs from current health problems in its relationship to work time. Those who work part-time or fixed-hour schedules are less likely to be obese, suggesting that long-term health risks operating through obesity, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, are affected by time availability.	2	Sibyl Kleiner; Eliza K.

Smith, Miriam. 2010. 'Gender Politics and the Same-sex Marriage Debate in the United States.' Social Politics. 17:1 1-28.	Social Politics	2010	2	This paper explores policy and legal debates over same-sex marriage in the United States, focusing on the indirect effects of the struggle over same-sex marriage and how these implicate the interests of women, including women in heterosexual relationships. The paper highlights the effects of the institutional structures of American politics, which have shaped the same-sex marriage debate in particular ways, privileging an incremental path of policy evolution across the states. This has forced US state courts to engage repeatedly with the legal arguments over same-sex relationship recognition and marriage and, in doing so, courts have increasingly cast the heterosexual nuclear family as a fragile edifice in need of state protection. The paper argues that we must move beyond thinking of same-sex marriage and relationship recognition as struggles that pit allegedly normalized or assimilated same-sex couples against queer politics and sensibilities and, rather, recognize the increasingly complex gender politics of same-sex marriage and relationship recognition, a politics that implicates groups beyond the LGBT community. In doing so, the paper argues that struggles over same-sex marriage are much more than simply struggles for recognition by LGBT communities but, rather, that they are the canary in the mineshaft of broad and profound shifts in gender relations.	1	Miriam Smith

Social Politics	2010	2	This article highlights the need in migrant research for a holistic approach that addresses migrants' reconciliation of work and care in the context of their evolving employment, career, and family circumstances. With a focus on these three central spheres of migrants' lives, in an Irish context, it demonstrates the complexities of female migrant care workers' transnational obligations, which together with immigration status and limited opportunities in their home and host countries serve to curtail career aspirations. The article considers how future ambitions are dependent on changing family circumstances and employment prospects in the ``receiving'' or ``sending'' country and argues that the inter-connectedness of these circumstances points to the need for greater co-ordination of migration, labor market, and care policies.	2	Martha Doyle; Virpi Timonen
Leimgruber, Matthieu. 2010. 'Protecting Soldiers, Not Mothers: Soldiers' Income Compensation in Switzerland During World War Ii.' Social Politics. 17:1 53-79.	Social Politics	2010	0	This article analyzes the role of soldiers' income compensation in the development of Swiss social policy. Introduced in 1940, compensation for wage losses incurred during militia duties (Erwerbersatzordnung, EO) became the forerunner of old age pensions, the cornerstone of the postwar welfare state. Yet, by entrenching links between citizenship, military service, and social rights, the EO also contributed to delaying programs such as family protection measures and maternity benefits. Besides underscoring the EO impact on the gendering of social policy, this article explores how this program was shaped by public-private partnerships and business interests.	1	Matthieu Leimgruber

Social Politics	2010	0	The thrust of federal educational policies in the United States is to treat differences between school children as marks of neediness and/or disability. Although these policies were developed to correct disturbing inequalities, we argue that they distort needs and portray them as exceptional and stigmatized. To demonstrate this distortion, we examine a ``difference'' among children with which many people are uncomfortable and thus reluctant to acknowledge-academic giftedness. Arguing that the education of children is a practice of care, we apply the theoretical insights and normative commitments of a feminist ethic of care.	2	Traci Levy; Elizabeth Palley
Schech, Susanne & Mochamad Mustafa. 2010. 'the Politics of Gender Mainstreaming Poverty Reduction: an Indonesian Case Study.' Social Politics. 17:1 111-135.	Social Politics	2010	3	Critical feminist reviews of gender mainstreaming suggest a widespread disillusionment with gender and development. The literature has been dominated, however, by accounts of gender mainstreaming in international development institutions and in Western countries. There is a shortage of studies on how developing countries conceptualize, design and manage gender mainstreaming in development policies and programs in specific political and economic contexts. This paper focuses on Indonesia which made gender mainstreaming a national policy while battling the impacts of the Asian economic crisis and experiencing a political transition from authoritarianism to democracy. This strategic moment created some opportunities and challenges for government, NGO, and international gender and development advocates to integrate gender into the national poverty reduction policy. An analysis of the policy drafts and interviews with key players in the policy process shows that gender expertise, institutional capacity, organizational resistance, and leadership at the national level were important factors. Broader political concerns such as the diminished standing of World Bank and the IMF in post-crisis Indonesia also played a role in the long-winded policy process that produced the Indonesia's National Poverty Reduction Strategy. One important lesson drawn from this case study is the need to indigenize gender mainstreaming, by building gender analysis capabilities in national women's machineries and forging stronger links with national and local gender-concerned NGOs and research institutions. Secondly, translating gender-aware poverty reduction policies into gender-responsive action remains a great challenge not only in Indonesia but elsewhere due to paucity of relevant gender-disaggregated data.	2	Susanne Schech; Mochamad Mustafa
Wilhelm, Mark & Rene Bekkers. 2010. 'Helping Behavior, Dispositional Empathic Concern, and the Principle of Care.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 73:1 11-32.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	11	This research investigates the relative strength of two correlates of helping behavior: dispositional empathic concern and a moral principle to care about others. The empathy-helping and care-helping relationships are investigated using data from the General Social Survey, a nationally representative random sample of the U. S. adult population. Ten helping behaviors are investigated. The results show that the care-helping relationship is stronger than the empathy-helping relationship for most helping behaviors, and that the empathy-helping relationship is mediated by the principle of care. That dispositional empathic concern is mediated by the principle of care requires new theoretical interpretations of the empathy helping relationship, and suggests new directions for research on helping behavior.	2	Mark Ottoni Wilhelm; Rene Bekkers
Kanazawa, Satoshi. 2010. 'Why Liberals and Atheists Are More Intelligent.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 73:1 33-57.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	25	The origin of values and preferences is an unresolved theoretical question in behavioral and social sciences. The Savanna-IQ Interaction Hypothesis, derived from the Savanna Principle and a theory of the evolution of general intelligence, suggests that more intelligent individuals may be more likely to acquire and espouse evolutionarily novel values and preferences (such as liberalism and atheism and, for men, sexual exclusivity) than less intelligent individuals, but that general intelligence may have no effect on the acquisition and espousal of evolutionarily familiar values (for children, marriage, family, and friends). The analyses of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Study 1) and the General Social Surveys (Study 2) show that adolescent and adult intelligence significantly increases adult liberalism, atheism, and men's (but not women's) value on sexual exclusivity.	1	Satoshi Kanazawa
Herman, Melissa. 2010. 'Do You See What I Am? How Observers' Backgrounds Affect Their Perceptions of Multiracial Faces.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 73:1 58-78.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	8	Although race is one of the most salient status characteristics in American society, many observers cannot distinguish the racial ancestries of multiracial youth. This paper examines how people perceive multiracial adolescents: specifically, I investigate whether observers perceive the adolescents as multiracial and whether these racial perceptions are congruent with the multiracial adolescents' self-identifications. Results show that 1) observers perceived close to half of multiracial targets as monoracial, 2) multiracial targets who identified themselves as black were nearly always perceived as black but not always as multiracial, and 3) the demographic and environmental characteristics of observers had no bearing on the congruence of their racial perceptions. That is, regardless of their own demographic characteristics or exposure to people of other races, observers were more congruent when examining targets who self-identified as black or white and less congruent when identifying targets from Asian, Hispanic, American Indian, or Middle Eastern backgrounds. Despite the demographic trend toward multiracialism in the United States, observers' perceptions may maintain the status quo in race relations: a black-white dichotomy where part-blacks remain in the collective black category.	1	Melissa R.

Quillian, Lincoln & Devah Pager. 2010. 'Estimating Risk: Stereotype Amplification and the Perceived Risk of Criminal Victimization.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 73:1 79-104.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	8	This paper considers the process by which individuals estimate the risk of adverse events, with particular attention to the social context in which risk estimates are formed. We compare subjective probability estimates of crime victimization to actual victimization experiences among respondents from the 1994 to 2002 waves of the Survey of Economic Expectations (Dominitz and Manski 2002). Using zip code identifiers, we then match these survey data to local area characteristics from the census. The results show that: (1) the risk of criminal victimization is significantly overestimated relative to actual rates of victimization or other negative events; (2) neighborhood racial composition is strongly associated with perceived risk of victimization, whereas actual victimization risk is driven by nonracial neighborhood characteristics; and (3) white respondents appear more strongly affected by racial composition than nonwhites in forming their estimates of risk. We argue these results support a model of stereotype amplification in the formation of risk estimates. Implications for persistent racial inequality are considered.	2	Lincoln Quillian; Devah Pager
Kesler, Christel & Michael Hout. 2010. 'Entrepreneurship and Immigrant Wages in Us Labor Markets: a Multi-level Approach.' Social Science Research. 39:2 187-201.	Social Science Research	2010	2	Some immigrants to the United States arrive to find co-ethnic communities that are highly entrepreneurial, and many members of their own group among their prospective employers. Other immigrants settle in far less entrepreneurial communities and have few if any co-ethnics among prospective employers. We assess whether co-ethnic entrepreneurship improves immigrant employees' wages. Previous research has focused on a small number of the largest ethnic groups in the largest cities. We study immigrants in 490 ethnic communities across the United States. Controlling for ethnicity. metropolitan area, and key individual- and community-level characteristics, we find effects of co-ethnic entrepreneurship on immigrant employees' wages that vary substantially with the characteristics of entrepreneurs and employees. Overall, immigrant employees earn lower hourly wages in more entrepreneurial Communities. but they earn higher wages where co-ethnic entrepreneurs are both numerous and economically successful. Low-skilled immigrant employees earn significantly less in highly entrepreneurial communities than they otherwise would.	2	Christel Kesler; Michael Hout
Kalil, Ariel & Danielle Crosby. 2010. 'Welfare Leaving and the Health of Young Children in Immigrant and Native Families.' Social Science Research. 39:2 202-214.	Social Science Research	2010	2	Research examining the effects of welfare dynamics on children's development has provided little information to date on the experiences of immigrant children. Using longitudinal data collected during the period of welfare reform (1995-1999; the Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods. PHDCN), this study investigates whether welfare leaving is associated with changes in preschool-aged children's (n = 550) physical health (i.e., general health status, sick days, respiratory illness and emergency room visits) over time, and whether these associations differ by parents' nativity status. We find that children of immigrant welfare leavers fare significantly worse in terms of their health than their peers in either native leaver families, or immigrant families who continued to receive assistance. Associations are robust to the inclusion of a wide range of control variables including children's initial health status, family demographic characteristics, qualities of the home environment, and indicators of parents' physical and mental health. Negative impacts of welfare leaving on children's health appear to be concentrated among immigrants who have multiple ``barriers'' to program participation (i.e., limited English proficiency. fewer years residing in the US, households with no citizen parent, and self-reported experiences of discrimination).	2	Ariel Kalil; Danielle Crosby
Lichter, Daniel, Domenico Parisi, Michael Taquino & Steven Grice. 2010. 'Residential Segregation in New Hispanic Destinations: Cities, Suburbs, and Rural Communities Compared.' Social Science Research. 39:2 215-230.	Social Science Research	2010	18	This paper provides new estimates of Hispanic-white residential segregation in new destinations and established Hispanic places. New Hispanic destinations are defined broadly to include metropolitan Cities, Suburban places, and rural communities with unusually rapid Hispanic growth rates. The analysis is framed with the spatial assimilation and place stratification perspectives and is based on block data from the 1990 and 2000 decennial censuses. The analysis confirms our basic hypothesis - that Hispanics are highly segregated in new Hispanic destinations. often at levels greatly exceeding those in established places. Hispanic suburbanization or exurbanization into new destinations is no marker of spatial assimilation. Consistent with the place stratification perspective, differences in Hispanic-white segregation between new destinations and established Hispanic areas cannot be explained by place-to-place differences in ecological location, Population composition, economic growth, employment, or Hispanic-white income inequality. Hispanic segregation in new destinations is especially sensitive to the size of the foreign-born Population and to preexisting ``minority threats'' in communities with large black populations. Segregation levels in new destinations also are less responsive to income disparities between Hispanics and whites; economic assimilation does not insure Hispanic spatial assimilation. Understanding how newcomers are spatially incorporated in new destinations will be a continuing challenge for scholars concerned about the spatial diffusion and apparent geographic balkanization of America's growing Hispanic Population.	4	Daniel T.

Baumle, Amanda. 2010. 'Border Identities: Intersections of Ethnicity and Sexual Orientation in the Us-mexico Borderland.' Social Science Research. 39:2 231-245.	Social Science Research	2010	1	The U.S. census data reveal high concentrations of same-sex unmarried partners in areas along the U.S.-Mexico border. In this article, I consider whether the above-average prevalence rates of same-sex unmarried partners along the U.S.-Mexico border can be attributed to measurement error. whether they provide evidence of enclave-like areas for Hispanic same-sex partners, or some combination thereof. Drawing on descriptive statistics and logistic regression analyses, I examine data validity issues, as well as possible explanations for the high presence of gay men and lesbians in these particular residential locations. In doing so, I pay particular attention to the role of ethnicity, language, and household size in creating potential measurement error, as well as in generating attractive enclave characteristics. These findings provide insight into both the validity of the U.S. census data on same-sex unmarried partners, as well as the role of the intersection of sexual orientation and Hispanic ethnicity in determining residential choice. Although undoubtedly measurement error is a contributing factor, findings nonetheless Support the existence of actual gay and lesbian enclaves and further suggest that immigration could play a role in generating these high concentration areas.	1	Amanda K.

Social Science Research	2010	7	Using data from a 2006-07 US survey of workers, we examine the association between creative work and work-to-family conflict, focusing special attention on the demands associated with creative work and their implications for work-family multitasking. Findings indicate that creative work is associated negatively with work-to-family conflict and stressful work-related thoughts-but these associations are suppressed by the following patterns: (1) creative work is associated with greater work demands; (2) those conditions are associated with higher levels of work-family multitasking; and (3) demands and multitasking increase work-to-family conflict and stressful boundary-spanning thoughts. Taken together, these patterns reveal suppression effects: Individuals with creative work would report lower work-to-family conflict and fewer stressful thoughts were it not for their exposure to work and boundary-spanning demands and their more frequent work-family multitasking. Collectively, our findings reveal previously undocumented patterns in the ways that the demands associated with creative work influence stress in the work-family interface.	2	Scott Schieman; Marisa Young
Kim, Joongbaeck. 2010. 'Neighborhood Disadvantage and Mental Health: the Role of Neighborhood Disorder and Social Relationships.' Social Science Research. 39:2 260-271.	Social Science Research	2010	13	Previous studies have shown that residents of neighborhoods with the concentration of poverty and female-headed households are at higher risk for depression. This study examines the effect of socioeconomically disadvantaged neighborhood on individual mental health by considering two possible mediating mechanisms: perceived neighborhood disorder and social relationships (social support and neighborhood social ties). The data were obtained from the 1995 Community, Crime, and Health survey sample consisting of 2482 adults and from a 1998 follow-up survey. Findings indicate that residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods have significantly higher levels of psychological distress than do residents of more advantaged neighborhoods with the introduction of social relationships and neighborhood disorder as mediators. Neighborhood disadvantage is associated with depression in three ways: (1) neighborhood disadvantage increased depression directly, (2) neighborhood disadvantage increased depression by way of neighborhood disorder, and (3) neighborhood disadvantage decreased depression through enhanced social relationships.	1	Joongbaeck Kim
Felson, Richard & Paul-Philippe Pare. 2010. 'Firearms and Fisticuffs: Region, Race, and Adversary Effects on Homicide and Assault.' Social Science Research. 39:2 272-284.	Social Science Research	2010	2	Analyses of the National Crime Victimization Survey and Supplemental Homicide Reports show that southern whites are much more likely than northern whites to be victims of gun homicides and assaults, but not other homicides and assaults. While blacks are more likely than whites to be victims of gun assaults (regardless of region). they have lower risks of assault victimization by unarmed offenders. The patterns are inconsistent with the subculture of violence thesis. In addition, incident analyses reveal that patterns of weapon use primarily reflect the race of the victim not the offender. Our results point to the importance of adversary effects: Offenders avoid assaulting blacks and southern whites unless they have guns because members of these groups are perceived as a greater threat. We suggest that the prevalence of armed assault in a community may lower the likelihood of unarmed assaults, and that honor culture explanations may be salvageable.	2	Richard B.

'the Relationship Between Outgroup Size and Anti-outgroup Attitudes: a Theoretical Synthesis and Empirical Test of Group Threat- and Intergroup Contact Theory.' Social Science Research. 39:2 285-295.	Social Science Research	2010	25	Although anti-immigrant attitudes represent a widespread social problem in many European societies, research has only partially understood the role the demographic size of the immigrant population plays for the prevalence of such attitudes. In this study, we use group threat- and intergroup contact theory to derive competing hypotheses on the role the size of the immigrant population plays for explaining the anti-immigrant attitudes of Dutch citizens. To this end, we used structural equation modeling with robust standard errors on nationally representative individual-level survey data enriched with official municipality-level statistics. We found empirical evidence for both group threat- and intergroup contact theory. Objective measurements of immigrant group size corresponded with subjective perceptions of a larger immigrant group size. Conversely, subjective perceptions of a larger immigrant group size were associated with perceptions of threatened group interests, which in turn related to anti-immigrant attitudes. On the other hand, however, larger immigrant group size facilitates intergroup contact, which was negatively associated with perceived threat and subsequent anti-immigrant attitudes.	2	Elmar Schlueter; Peer Scheepers

Social Science Research. 39:2 296-309.	Social Science Research	2010	7	Studies suggest that students who participate in extracurricular activities benefit in a number of ways. However, schools provide different opportunities to participate in these activities. Using information from high school yearbooks and administrative data on students and schools in North Carolina, we examine whether school characteristics influence the numbers and types of extracurricular activities available, whether schools providing more and diverse activities have higher participation rates, and whether these schools have better academic outcomes. We find that school size and poverty levels significantly influence the number and types of activities available, with larger schools and those schools with more affluent student bodies offering more activities. In addition, schools with more activities available tend to have higher participation rates. Opportunities to participate are associated with positive academic outcomes for the school, even when controlling for school resources. For some-but not all-activities, student participation rates mediate the relationship between activity availability and the school's academic profile. For benefits to be present, schools must provide these resources, and students must invest in them.	2	Elizabeth Stearns; Elizabeth J. Glennie
An, Brian. 2010. 'the Relations Between Race, Family Characteristics, and Where Students Apply to College.' Social Science Research. 39:2 310-323.	Social Science Research	2010	5	This paper examines the impact of race, family background, and parental investments on a behavioral manifestation of educational expectations: where students apply to college. Submitting an application to colleges is an important step in the transition to college because the majority of four-year colleges require Students to apply before enrolling. This paper documents the effects of social origins on the selectivity of where high school seniors applied, based on a national sample from the class of 2004. The results show general support for the contention that social background and parental investments influence where students apply to college. Minority students are more likely to apply to selective colleges than comparable white students. Parental education is positively associated with the selectivity of the college to which students apply. Family structure and sibship size, however. are not associated with applying to a selective college. Parental economic and interactional investments are also associated with where students apply to college. I further examine the interplay between family background and race and find that family background exerts a uniform influence on where students apply irrespective of race and ethnic origin.	1	Brian P.

Tittle, Charles & Thomas Rotolo. 2010. 'Socio-demographic Homogenizing Trends Within Fixed-boundary Spatial Areas in the United States.' Social Science Research. 39:2 324-340.	Social Science Research	2010	1	Using complete census tract, county, and PMSA analog data with longitudinally fixed (standardized) boundaries for the entire United States in 1980, 1990, and 2000, we investigate potential homogenizing trends within spatial areas hypothesized by Massey and others but contradicted by the theorizing of Florida and others. The results for seven socio-demographic variables show a trend toward increasing similarity in the majority of socio-demographic variables in all types of spatial units examined. However, we observe increasing heterogeneity in some conditions and for some variables, particularly racial/ethnic characteristics and family structure. These findings are consistent with the collective body of prior evidence based on less comprehensive data, suggesting that theories of social change and spatial characteristics may benefit from some degree of theoretical integration in which the circumstances under which homogenization or heterogenization may be most likely are better specified theoretically.	2	Charles R.

Lim, Chaeyoon. 2010. 'Mobilizing on the Margin: How Does Interpersonal Recruitment Affect Citizen Participation in Politics?.' Social Science Research. 39:2 341-355.	Social Science Research	2010	5	This study examines how interpersonal recruitment affects participation in demanding forms of political activity. Previous studies have argued that interpersonal recruitment causally affects participation. However, recruitment attempts are selectively targeted toward people with high participation potential. This implies that interpersonal recruitment may work simply because recruiters ask the people who would participate anyway. Using propensity score matching, I show that interpersonal recruitment has larger effects on non-electoral forms of participation than electoral ones such as campaign volunteer activity. I find little evidence that personal contact increases campaign donation. I also demonstrate that the effect of recruitment is not constant across individuals but varies by the propensity of being a recruitment target. ironically, people who have less chance of receiving requests are more likely to be affected. I discuss the implications of these findings for declining and increasingly unequal political participation.	1	Chaeyoon Lim
Martin, John & Matthew Desmond. 2010. 'Political Position and Social Knowledge.' Sociological Forum. 25:1 1-26.	Sociological Forum	2010	8	The nature of social cognition-how we ``know about'' the social world-is one of the most deceptively obvious problems for sociology. Because we know what we know, we often think that we know how or why we know it. Here, we investigate one particular aspect of social cognition, namely, what we will call ``political ideology''-that is, people's self-placement on a dimension on which persons can be arrayed from left to right. We focus on that understanding that is in some ways the ``ur-form'' of social cognition-our sense of how we stand by others in an implicit social formation whose meaning is totally relational. At the same time, these self-conceptions seem to be of the greatest importance for the development of the polity and of civil society itself. Our question is, when citizens develop such a ``political ideology,'' what does this mean, and what do they do with it? We examine what citizens gain from their subjective placement on the dimension from liberalism to conservatism by using the results of a survey experiment that alters aspects of a hypothetical policy.	2	John Levi Martin; Matthew Desmond
Gomez-Barris, Macarena. 2010. 'Witness Citizenship: the Place of Villa Grimaldi in Chilean Memory.' Sociological Forum. 25:1 27-46.	Sociological Forum	2010	1	The rebuilding of democracy on the former site of a bloody dictatorship continues to be a work in progress in contemporary Chile. Since 1990, the importance of Villa Grimaldi, and other key cultural sites like it, cannot be dismissed as mere sideshows to the ``real business'' of democratic state-making.The conversion of a former torture complex to a peace park raises a provocative question both around the function of cultural memory and memorialization: What is the role of a former concentration camp turned memorial park in Chile's process of democratization? I argue that public memorials like Villa Grimaldi Peace Park can be important complements to the incomplete process of transitional justice in nations that have experienced grave human rights violations. Such sites provide significant forms of sociability, which I call ``witness citizenship'' (human rights participation, generational transmission, and other forms of civic action) that deepen the reach of democracy, especially in the social spaces where truth commissions and institutional processes have not been able to reach.	1	Macarena Gomez-Barris
Weinberg, Martin & Colin Williams. 2010. 'Bare Bodies: Nudity, Gender, and the Looking Glass Body.' Sociological Forum. 25:1 47-67.	Sociological Forum	2010	3	This article examines the role of nude embodiment as it affects sexuality, intimacy, and pleasure when people seek to align their nude body with cultural values. This research, based on open-ended and closed-ended data from 184 young heterosexual adults attending a large Midwestern university, finds the experience of nude embodiment and its effects to be strongly gendered. For example, among both men and women, comfort with one's nude body is associated with a sexually expansive point of view, but it is only found to be associated with sexual behavior and pleasure among the women. For women, too, feelings of objectification in nude embodiment are shown to be mitigated through positive relationships with their male partner. Throughout we emphasize the ``lived experience'' of the body, especially as experienced in the body techniques used in the pursuit of sexual intimacy and pleasure. Discussion relates these results to objectification theory and how wider social changes may impinge on sexual embodiment in general.	2	Martin S. Weinberg; Colin J. Williams
Harnois, Catherine. 2010. 'Race, Gender, and the Black Women's Standpoint.' Sociological Forum. 25:1 68-85.	Sociological Forum	2010	2	Hill Collins (1997, 1998, 2000) argues that because of their position within the intersecting hierarchies of race, gender, and class, black women as a group possess a ``unique angle of vision'' on the social world. Rooted in the everyday experiences of black women, the ``black women's standpoint'' is marked by an intersectional understanding of oppression and a ``legacy of struggle'' against such oppression. In this article, I employ quantitative analyses of data from the National Survey of Black Americans (1992) and the National Black Feminist Study (2004-2005) to investigate the black women's standpoint. I ask: ``Do black women as a group tend toward the black women's standpoint that Hill Collins describes?'' and ``Do black women embrace this perspective more than black men?'' Results from numerous chi 2 and logistic regression analyses suggest that, within the black community, gender is not a significant predictor of the standpoint that Hill Collins describes, with black men and black women being equally likely to embrace many of the core ideas associated with the black women's standpoint. I conclude by discussing the implications of this finding for gender and race-based standpoint theory.	1	Catherine E. Harnois
Aneesh, A.. 2010. 'Bloody Language: Clashes and Constructions of Linguistic Nationalism in India.' Sociological Forum. 25:1 86-109.	Sociological Forum	2010	0	Locating ``nation'' not on the center but on its borders, this study seeks to shift the study of nation from an analysis centered on its origins or its substantive and foundational aspects to an investigation focused on its mode of boundary construction. This article reverses the debate over whether nations grow out of some presumed ethnic, linguistic, or religious foundations to argue that these foundations themselves are given shape by a sociocognitive frame of total closure that informs the national system. Taking a close look at the formation of India and Pakistan as nations, the article shows how Hindi and Urdu were separated as two distinct national languages out of the same dialect-Khari Boli-under the pressure of conflicting national aspirations of nineteenth-century South Asia. To exaggerate differences, Hindi was developed as a Sanskritized version of Khari Boli, while Urdu matured as its Persianized form. Devnagari and Persian scripts respectively gave them their distinctive looks.	1	A. Aneesh
Zottarelli, Lisa. 2010. 'Broken Bond: an Exploration of Human Factors Associated With Companion Animal Loss During Hurricane Katrina.' Sociological Forum. 25:1 110-122.	Sociological Forum	2010	1	Hurricane Katrina was not the first disaster to expose companion animals and their guardians to significant risk, nor was it the first time organizations were involved in the recovery of animals left by people who evacuated. Yet it was during Hurricane Katrina that there was significant media exposure to the plight of pets in disasters. The purpose of this article is to (1) explore preexisting characteristics of disaster vulnerability of people who experienced pet loss, and (2) examine pet loss in association with evacuation behaviors and other traumatic experiences. The survey data are from a random sample of 1,510 Hurricane Katrina survivors conducted by the Gallup Organization in September and October 2005. Descriptive, bivariate, and multivariate analyses were conducted. Women, younger adults, and people who evacuated were more likely to have lost a pet during Hurricane Katrina. Additionally, people who lost pets were statistically different from their counterparts in terms of experiencing other traumatic events, including being separated from family, staying in an emergency shelter, and being hurt or injured. The results of this study support calls for greater attention to companion animals and their guardians during disasters in order to promote public health and safety.	1	Lisa K. Zottarelli
Sakamoto, Arthur, Hyeyoung Woo & ChangHwan Kim. 2010. 'Does an Immigrant Background Ameliorate Racial Disadvantage? the Socioeconomic Attainments of Second-generation African Americans.' Sociological Forum. 25:1 123-146.	Sociological Forum	2010	4	Although there is a growing literature on the socioeconomic circumstances of the second generation, this issue has not been systematically considered for African Americans. To help fill this research gap, we investigate the extent to which the socioeconomic attainments of second-generation African Americans differ from mainstream (i.e., third and higher generation) African Americans. Using data from the Current Population Survey and the 2000 Census, our results indicate that the schooling and wages of second-generation African Americans consistently exceed those of third- and higher generation African Americans. Our findings also reveal that second-generation African Americans do at least as well as whites in terms of years of schooling, but wage differentials differ significantly by gender. Second-generation African-American women earn wages that are at least as high as comparable white women, but second-generation African-American men earn wages that are, on average, about 16\% less than measurably comparable white men. While no one theoretical perspective can account for all these results, they nonetheless indicate the continuing significance of racial disadvantage for African-American men, including those with an immigrant background.	3	Arthur Sakamoto; Hyeyoung Woo; ChangHwan Kim

Today, we argue, it is the continued use of the term stereotype that serves as our ``car window'' and can hold us back from truly understanding race and gender. The use of the term stereotype is not (nor has it ever been) a useful analytic tool because the term invokes a individualistic and psychological argument where a sociological mechanism might be more fruitfully employed.	2	Bethany P.

Drawing on theoretical perspectives and empirical data, this article focuses on ordinary Americans who have suffered during trying times. First, one popular set of political narratives is shown to fit the sociological model of ``blaming the victim.'' Second, General Social Survey data from 1991 and 2004 are used to counter charges of widespread consumer opportunism and to expose the serious systemic vulnerabilities that existed for Americans before the recession.	1	Judith Treas
Sakamoto, Arthur & Changhwan Kim. 2010. 'Is Rising Earnings Inequality Associated With Increased Exploitation? Evidence for Us Manufacturing Industries, 1971-1996.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:1 19-43.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	4	Is the trend towards rising earnings inequality associated with increased exploitation? The authors investigate exploitation among workers using data for manufacturing industries. Defined as the underpayment of earnings relative to productivity as evaluated in the market, exploitation is measured for various groups of employees. The results indicate significant levels of exploitation among women, Hispanics, African Americans, and blue-collar workers. By contrast, employees who are overpaid relative to their productivities include middle-aged workers, older workers, and managers. Additional findings suggest that the increase in inequality in recent years has been associated with heightened exploitation due to the underpayment of workers in the lowest two quintiles of the earnings distribution, while workers in the upper two quintiles have become increasingly overpaid. Rising earnings inequality in the manufacturing sector thus appears to be associated with increased exploitation when the latter is measured as the underpayment of market value to workers. A related analysis by Liu, Sakamoto, and Su also investigates patterns of economic underpayment and overpayment but does not link them explicitly to inequality in the distribution of earnings and how the level of inequality has been increasing in recent years.	2	Arthur Sakamoto; Changhwan Kim
Vasquez, Jessica. 2010. 'Blurred Borders for Some but Not ``others'': Racialization, ``flexible Ethnicity,'' Gender, and Third-generation Mexican American Identity.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:1 45-71.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	7	How are the lives of middle-class third-generation Mexican Americans both racialized and gendered? Third-generation Mexican Americans in California experience a racialization process continuum that extends from ``flexible ethnicity,'' the ability to be considered an ``insider'' in different racial/ethnic communities, to racialization as nonwhite that is enforced through the deployment of negative stereotypes. Using interview data, the author finds that women are afforded more ``flexible ethnicity'' than men. Accordingly, men are more rigorously racialized than women. Women are racialized through exoticization, whereas men are racialized as threats to safety. Lighter-skinned individuals escaped consistent racialization. These findings have consequences for the incorporation possibilities of later-generation Mexican Americans, as women and light-skinned (often multiracial) individuals are more frequently granted ``flexible ethnicity'' and less strongly racialized than men and dark-skinned (often monoracial) individuals. Even among the structurally assimilated, contemporary racial and gender hierarchies limit the voluntary quality of ethnicity among third-generation Mexican Americans.	1	Jessica M. Vasquez
Cohen-Marks, Mara & Jim Faught. 2010. 'Perceptions of Race Relations in Contexts of Ethnic Diversity and Change.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:1 73-98.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	0	Examining public opinion data from a 2007 survey of Los Angeles, the authors consider racial and ethnic variation in perceptions of race relations across neighborhoods in various contexts of demographic composition and change. Using several measures of ethnic diversity, the authors examine whether racial attitudes differ depending on the demographic mix at the census tract level, and if the relative importance of ethnicity and other individual characteristics varies depending on the proportion, ratio, or diversity of ethnic groups within tracts. Only among African Americans do they find a consistent impact of racial/ethnic identity on perception of race relations, although such attitudes do not vary within various measures of neighborhood diversity. The results suggest limitations to the assumed significance-either positive or negative-of neighborhood diversity on individuals of various races and ethnicities.	2	Mara A. Cohen-Marks; Jim Faught
Thompson, Melissa. 2010. 'Race, Gender, and the Social Construction of Mental Illness in the Criminal Justice System.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:1 99-125.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	2	This article tests whether perceptions of ``normal'' defendants influence the use of psychiatric evaluations in the criminal justice system. The author theorizes that typifications-or taken-for-granted assumptions-of African Americans as ``criminals'' and women as ``mentally ill'' will influence court actors' perceptions of the rationality of a defendant's criminal actions. Using case-control sampling methods, the author compiled data from a large Midwestern county to examine the demographic, familial, legal, and psychiatric predictors of which felony defendants receive a psychiatric evaluation; these psychiatric evaluations are indications that the defendant may be considered exempt from criminal responsibility. Using logistic regression, the author finds that mental health status is the best predictor of psychiatric evaluations but that criminal justice decision-makers' attributions of criminal responsibility are also influenced by typifications of defendants based on race and gender.	1	Melissa Thompson
Kikuchi, George & Scott Desmond. 2010. 'a Longitudinal Analysis of Neighborhood Crime Rates Using Latent Growth Curve Modeling.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:1 127-149.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	2	Although social disorganization theory provides a framework for understanding how changes in neighborhoods can influence crime rates over time, research on neighborhood characteristics and crime has relied primarily on cross-sectional data. Using a latent growth curve model and longitudinal data on residential burglary and vehicle theft in Indianapolis, measured annually between 1992 and 2006 at the census block group level, the authors analyzed the relationships between neighborhood characteristics and crime trends. For both residential burglary and vehicle theft, baseline models revealed that changes in crime rates were best captured by a quadratic function with an initial linear decrease and subsequent deceleration ( slowing) of the decrease. When neighborhood characteristics were included as predictors, change in neighborhood disadvantage was significantly related to changes in both residential burglary and vehicle theft over time, while change in residential stability did not have a significant effect on changes in residential burglary or vehicle theft.	2	George Kikuchi; Scott A.

Sociological Quarterly	2010	1	Using labor market theory, we assess how we have constructed the teaching of required courses on diversity, with the potential splitting of the academy into distinctive labor markets. In-depth interviews with instructors of color and nonminorities who teach required diversity-education courses at a predominately white university are qualitatively assessed and describe the differences in the emotional labor attached to this segmented academic market. We identify specific dimensions of diversity teaching that attach to the job conditions of secondary labor markets, including the distortion of work loads and evidence of differential barriers in the emotional labor attached. These labor market conditions may structurally limit opportunities for career survival and advancement of minority and female instructors.	4	Helen A.

Glavin, Paul & Scott Schieman. 2010. 'Interpersonal Context at Work and the Frequency, Appraisal, and Consequences of Boundary-spanning Demands.' Sociological Quarterly. 51:2 205-225.	Sociological Quarterly	2010	1	Compared to job-specific conditions, the interpersonal context of work has received less attention from work-family scholars. Using data from a 2007 U.S. survey of workers (N = 1,286), we examine the impact of workplace social support and interpersonal conflict on work-family conflict and exposure to boundary-spanning demands-as indexed by the frequency that workers receive work-related contact outside of normal work hours. Findings indicate that workplace social support is associated negatively with work-to-family conflict, while interpersonal conflict at work is associated with higher levels of work-to-family conflict. Results also indicate that both supportive and conflictive work contexts are associated with more frequent exposure to boundary-spanning demands. However, workers in supportive contexts are more likely to appraise these demands as beneficial for accomplishing work tasks, and are less likely to appraise them as disruptive to family roles. By contrast, workers in conflictive contexts are more likely to appraise demands as disruptive to family roles, and are less likely to appraise them as beneficial for paid work. Consequently, our findings underscore the resource and demands aspects of interpersonal work contexts and their implications for the work-family interface.	2	Paul Glavin; Scott Schieman

Statistical models that take into account the contextual effects of family policies on gender inequality in earnings are constructed. Results from multilevel models show that progressive state institutional environments supportive of norms of equality help female employees catch-up with their male counterparts with regard to rewards, while states that function as welfare providers and employers exacerbate the gender gap in earnings.	1	Kirak Ryu

Less attention has been given to the influence that legal change might have on the movement's subsequent development. Does the achievement of legal goals help the movement mobilize or does the movement experience decline once change occurs? Using unique measures of gay and lesbian mobilization, I investigate the influence of legal change on the number of gay and lesbian movement organizations in each state from 1974 to 1999. Results demonstrate that the impact of legal change is contingent on the type of reform achieved and the cultural context surrounding the decision.	1	Melinda D. Kane

Sociological Quarterly	2010	2	This study uses an intersectional approach to predict attitudes toward immigrants by examining the intersections of race, class, gender, and social space. With data from the 2004 General Social Survey and the 2000 Census, generalized hierarchal linear modeling generates significant two-way and three-way interactions in predicting attitudes toward immigrants taking jobs, improving the economy, committing crime, and migrating to the United States. Important differences in attitudes between groups and within groups only emerge when particular intersections are considered in the analysis. One implication is that pro-immigrant organizations may gain greater support by devising political strategies from an intersectional perspective.	1	Justin Allen Berg
Mollborn, Stefanie. 2010. 'Predictors and Consequences of Adolescents' Norms Against Teenage Pregnancy.' Sociological Quarterly. 51:2 303-328.	Sociological Quarterly	2010	2	African American and Latino teenagers and communities are frequently assumed to have weaker norms against teenage pregnancy than whites. Despite their importance, adolescents' norms about teenage pregnancy have not been measured or their correlates and consequences documented. This study examines individual-level and contextual variation in adolescents' embarrassment at the prospect of a teenage pregnancy and its relationship with subsequent teenage pregnancy. Descriptive analyses find that norms vary by gender and individual- and neighborhood-level race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES). In multivariate analyses, neighborhood-level racial/ethnic associations with embarrassment are explained by neighborhood-level SES. Embarrassment is associated with a lower likelihood of subsequent teenage pregnancy but does not mediate racial, ethnic, or socioeconomic influences, underscoring the importance of both norms and structural factors for understanding teenage fertility.	1	Stefanie Mollborn

Sociological Quarterly	2010	3	Temporal analyses of social movement mobilization provide insight into how repression shapes social movement tactics and in turn, how social movements affect state response. We use the case of environmental dissent in Communist Czechoslovakia to unpack this interplay. The regime quelled activism and was grossly negligent in environmental matters, fomenting an underground environmental movement. Our data included archival documents, historical accounts, and in-depth interviews. Findings indicate the importance of political context in examining state tactics. We highlight how dissidents can test the boundaries of state tolerance to expose vulnerabilities of the state as well as political opportunities for activism.	2	Thomas E. Shriver; Alison E. Adams
Atkinson, Will. 2010. 'Phenomenological Additions to the Bourdieusian Toolbox: Two Problems for Bourdieu, Two Solutions From Schutz.' Sociological Theory. 28:1 1-19.	Sociological Theory	2010	11	In constructing his renowned theory of practice, Pierre Bourdieu claimed to have integrated the key insights from phenomenology and successfully melded them with objectivist analysis. The contention here, however, is that while his vision of the social world may indeed be generally laudable, he did not take enough from phenomenology. More specifically, there are two concepts in Alfred Schutz's body of work, which, if properly defined, disentangled from phenomenology, and appropriated, allow two frequently forwarded criticisms of Bourdieu's perspective to be overcome: on the one hand, a particular interpretation of the concept of lifeworld can remedy identified weaknesses on the problem of individuation; while on the other hand, Schutz's notion of the stock of knowledge can rectify Bourdieu's overly nonconscious depiction of agency. Given my overall support for Bourdieu's scheme and the fact that the extant criticisms on these two grounds are often excessive and obfuscatory, both the suggested elaborations will be prefaced by a clarificatory partial defense of his position.	1	Will Atkinson
Reed, Isaac. 2010. 'Epistemology Contextualized: Social-scientific Knowledge in a Postpositivist Era.' Sociological Theory. 28:1 20-39.	Sociological Theory	2010	1	In the production of knowledge about social life, two social contexts come together: the context of investigation, consisting of the social world of the investigator, and the context of explanation, consisting of the social world of the actors who are the subject of study. The nature of, and relationship between, these contexts is imagined in philosophy; managed, rewarded, and sanctioned in graduate seminars, journal reviews, and tenure cases; and practiced in research. Positivism proposed to produce objective knowledge by suppressing the nonlogical and nonobservational aspects of the contexts. Attacks on positivism disputed the effectiveness and rationality of this strategy. Thus ``postpositivism'' can be understood as a series of attempts to reconstitute the relation between the contexts as the basis for accurate social knowledge. Two of the most important of these attempts-grounded theory and postmodern anthropology-are considered, and a synthesis, which draws from the insights of cultural sociology, is proposed.	1	Isaac Ariail Reed
Reich, Wendelin. 2010. 'Three Problems of Intersubjectivity-and One Solution.' Sociological Theory. 28:1 40-63.	Sociological Theory	2010	5	Social thinkers often use the concept of intersubjectivity to mark out a problem of theoretical sociology: If people are unable to look into each others' minds, why do they often understand each other nonetheless? This issue has been debated extensively by philosophers and sociologists in three largely disconnected discourses. The article investigates the three discourses for isolable ideas that can be fitted into a sociological answer to the problem of intersubjectivity. An interactional solution, fully coherent with key insights from the discourses, is offered at the end of the article. Its main point is to identify coordinative interactional mechanisms that compel participants to ``make themselves understandable'' vis-a-vis their interaction partners.	1	Wendelin Reich
Marshall, Douglas. 2010. 'Temptation, Tradition, and Taboo: a Theory of Sacralization.' Sociological Theory. 28:1 64-90.	Sociological Theory	2010	1	A theory of sacralization is offered in which the sacred emerges from the collision of temptation and tradition. It is proposed that when innate or acquired desires to behave in one way conflict with socially acquired and/or mediated drives to behave in another way, actors ascribe sacredness to the objects of their action as a means of reconciling the difference between their desired and actual behavior toward those objects. After establishing the sacred as a theoretical construct, the theory is sketched and then fleshed out with a more formal specification. The foundational assumptions and mechanisms of the theory are then empirically substantiated as a first step toward validating the theory, and a handful of predictions deduced from the theory are assessed.	1	Douglas A.

Reay, Mike. 2010. 'Knowledge Distribution, Embodiment, and Insulation.' Sociological Theory. 28:1 91-107.	Sociological Theory	2010	1	This article looks at how parts of a social stock of knowledge can become insulated from each other via their uneven distribution both ``horizontally'' across time and space, and ``vertically'' with respect to degrees of embodiment in unconscious habits and routines. It uses ideas from Alfred Schutz, Peter Berger, Thomas Luckmann, Michael Polanyi, and others to argue that this insulation can produce a highly dynamic structuring of knowledge, awareness of which has the potential to help explain the existence of ignorance, misperception, and multiple interpretations in different social settings. This potential is illustrated with examples taken from a study of American economists, showing how an approach considering insulation can improve understanding of at least one currently influential branch of knowledge. The article also suggests briefly how such an approach might augment recent theories of habitual action by accounting for both stability and change, and even help with some longstanding epistemological problems in social theory.	1	Mike Reay
McKinnon, Andrew. 2010. 'Elective Affinities of the Protestant Ethic: Weber and the Chemistry of Capitalism.' Sociological Theory. 28:1 108-126.	Sociological Theory	2010	2	Although scholars have long recognized the importance of ``elective affinity'' as a key word in Weber's sociology, surprisingly little systematic research has gone into understanding this metaphor in Weber's writing, or the source from which he drew the term. For Weber, this was an implicit reference to Goethe's novel, well known to Weber's educated German audience, entitled Elective Affinities (1807). In this article, I provide a systematic account of Goethe's conception of elective affinity as a chemical metaphor, and of the way that it is related to Weber's uses of the term in the Protestant ethic essays and in his critical rejoinders. By understanding elective affinity as a Goethean chemical metaphor we can better understand the causal claims that Weber makes in his famous essay: Weber's argument is best understood as an analysis of emergence in the chemistry of social relations.	1	Andrew M.

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	5	Despite ongoing controversies regarding the impact of lifestyle factors such as body weight, diet and exercise on health, this framework has become increasingly prominent in understandings of cancer aetiology. To date, little consideration has been given to the impacts of such discourses on people with a history of cancer. Drawing on an ethnographic study of cancer survivors, I explore the constitutive dimensions of these discourses and the ways that they shape the subjectivities of women and men with a history of the disease. Overall, the study participants evidenced a complex and ambivalent engagement with such discourses. While they were generally unwilling to accept that their lifestyle had an impact on the development of their cancer, to varying degrees they endorsed the idea that weight, diet and exercise affected cancer progression. However, this acceptance was generally borne of an active desire to gain control over the uncertainty of living with the disease and was mediated by other aspects of the experience of surviving cancer.	1	Kirsten Bell

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	8	Genetic testing to identify susceptibility to a variety of common complex diseases is increasingly becoming available. In this article, focusing on the development of genetic susceptibility testing for diet-related disease, I examine the emergence of direct-to-the-consumer genetic testing services and the (re)configuration of healthcare provision, both within and outside the specialist genetics service, in the UK. I identify two key techniques within these practices: empowerment and facilitation. Using Foucauldian social theory, I show that empowerment and facilitation are being positioned as tools for the creation of citizen-consumers who will make appropriate dietary choices, based on the results of their genetic analysis. Through these techniques, individuals are transformed into properly entrepreneurial citizens who will, through judicious choices, act to maximise their `vital capital' (their health) and the capital of the social body. I argue that the user of these services is not purely an economic figure, making rational choices as a consumer, but that her configuration as a citizen-consumer who avails herself of genetic information and services in a proper manner ensures that she is fit to contribute to the economic life of our present.	1	Alison Harvey
Rostila, Mikael. 2010. 'Birds of a Feather Flock Together - and Fall Ill? Migrant Homophily and Health in Sweden.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:3 382-399.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	10	Although studies show that health inequities between ethnic groups exist, few have expressed interest in the origins of these disparities. As homophily (the phenomenon that people principally form relationships with those who are similar to them) influences people's norms and interactions, it might be an important property of migrants' networks, and have implications on their health. The aim of this study is to examine health inequities between natives and immigrants in Sweden and the health consequences arising from participation in homogenous migrant networks. Using total population registers and representative survey data initial analyses show that migrants experience poorer health than native Swedes. The findings further suggest that homophily is a prominent feature of migrant social networks and that migrants in networks with a high proportion of other migrants experience poorer health than those who include a high proportion of natives in their networks. However, unhealthy behaviour and disadvantaged social conditions may account for a considerable share of their excess risk. Hence, network closure may reinforce and maintain norms leading to negative behaviour and social conditions in such networks.	1	Mikael Rostila

Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:3 400-414.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	5	Caring labour in long-term care settings is increasingly important as the US population ages. Ethnographic research on nursing assistants (NAs) portrays nursing home care as routine and fast paced in facilities that emphasise life maintenance more than care. Recent interview-based and small quantitative studies describe a mix of positive and negative aspects of NA work, including the rewards of caring, despite shortcomings in working conditions and pay. The current study continues this research but, for the first time, using national data. The 2004 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Nursing Assistant Study (NNAS) provides survey data from 3,017 NAs working in long-term care facilities across the US. The NNAS results confirm the importance and centrality of caring to NAs' work. NAs motivated by caring for others were significantly more satisfied with their jobs than those motivated by other reasons, such as convenience or salary. Overall, NAs report surprisingly high job satisfaction, particularly with learning new skills, doing challenging work, and organisational support for caring labour. Areas of dissatisfaction were salary, time for reproductive labour, and turnover. Intersectional analysis revealed race and citizenship played a stronger role than gender in worker satisfaction.	2	Carter C. Rakovski; Kim Price-Glynn

'Questioning the Answer: Questioning Style, Choice and Self-determination in Interactions With Young People With Intellectual Disabilities.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:3 415-436.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	7	For young people with intellectual disabilities (ID), the transition from children's to adult services has long been recognised as a challenging move. One of the aims of the White Paper Valuing People (2001) was to address some of the problems associated with this transition. This paper reports on data from a project which examines the impact of these service changes, and the ways in which transition is negotiated by carers, professionals and users. It presents a conversation analysis of eight tape-recorded formal review meetings at which transition to adult services is discussed. It takes as its starting point the existing interactional work on ID and the way in which this demonstrates the effects of the local and contextual specifics of particular kinds of interaction on the eventual outcomes (e.g. Rapley 2004, Antaki 2001, Maynard and Marlaire 1992). We show that an attempt to allow self-determination in the context of transitions can paradoxically result in undermining user choice and control. We also argue that, while a rule-based approach to practice may offer moral clarity for professionals, it can result in interactional and practical difficulties which cannot be easily reconciled.	4	Alison Pilnick; Jennifer Clegg; Elizabeth Murphy; Kathryn Almack

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	0	Staff in the psychiatric emergency room (PER) have demanding jobs requiring a complex balance between the needs and safety of the individual and the community, systemic resources, and job responsibilities while providing timely, effective care. Little research exists concerning day-to-day work activities of PER staff, their interaction, and their perceptions of their work. This study explored the work of PER staff and the organisational context of the PER work setting. Observations of staff were conducted in the public spaces of a public urban PER using two observational techniques. The first was designed to measure the types of work activities staff engaged in and the time spent in these work activities (work task data). The second technique was the gathering of observational data by a peripheral-member-researcher (participant observation data). Analyses were conducted of both the work task and participant observation data. Results indicate that most PER staff time is spent in administrative and phone tasks, while less than a third is spent on direct clinical work. Four important issues for PER work were identified: a workload that is unmanageable, managing the unmanageable, bogus referrals and dumping and insurance problems. The PER remains the front-line of the medical and social service systems. Work done in these settings is of critical importance; however little attention is paid to the content and nature of the work. Our study demonstrates that staff of the PER face challenges on many levels as they struggle with the task of working with people presenting in psychiatric and social crisis.	5	Alisa K.

Whooley, Owen. 2010. 'Diagnostic Ambivalence: Psychiatric Workarounds and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:3 452-469.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	13	In 1980 the American Psychiatric Association (APA), faced with increased professional competition, revised the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). Psychiatric expertise was redefined along a biomedical model via a standardised nosology. While they were an integral part of capturing professional authority, the revisions demystified psychiatric expertise, leaving psychiatrists vulnerable to infringements upon their autonomy by institutions adopting the DSM literally. This research explores the tensions surrounding standardisation in psychiatry. Drawing on in-depth interviews with psychiatrists, I explore the `sociological ambivalence' psychiatrists feel towards the DSM, which arises from the tension between the desire for autonomy in practice and the professional goal of legitimacy within the system of mental health professions. To carve a space for autonomy for their practice, psychiatrists develop `workarounds' that undermine the DSM in practice. These workarounds include employing alternative diagnostic typologies, fudging the numbers (or codes) on official paperwork and negotiating diagnoses with patients. In creating opportunities for patient input and resistance to fixed diagnoses, the varied use of the DSM raises fundamental questions for psychiatrists about the role of the biomedical model of mental illness, especially its particular manifestation in the DSM.	1	Owen Whooley
Redley, Marcus. 2010. 'the Clinical Assessment of Patients Admitted to Hospital Following an Episode of Self-harm: a Qualitative Study.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:3 470-485.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	2	Based upon qualitative interviews with clinicians responsible for assessing patients admitted to hospital following an episode of self-harm by overdose, this paper documents interactional factors that shape both how clinicians conduct these assessments and their understanding of what `causes' someone to harm themselves. The analysis first documents how the patients' overdoses are framed as essentially impulsive acts committed in response to adverse circumstances. This is achieved by clinicians' avoidance of any engagement with, or assessment of, a patient's reasons for taking an overdose. Secondly, the analysis considers why the patients' reasons for taking an overdose do not feature in the clinicians' assessments, and shows, by an examination of two deviant cases, that clinicians avoid engaging with patients' motivations so as to: minimise the risk of generating bedside disagreements; avoid the possibility of being drawn into the emotional life of a patient, and shield themselves from the social and economic inequalities that are a feature of many patients' lives. The paper concludes with a discussion of how bedside assessments that do not engage with patients' reasons for taking an overdose might be experienced by the patients themselves and the deleterious effect this could have upon their clinical management.	1	Marcus Redley
Walsh, Denis. 2010. 'Childbirth Embodiment: Problematic Aspects of Current Understandings.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:3 486-501.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	7	The experience of childbirth is one of the most corporeal of the human condition. Against a backdrop of profound change in the milieu of birthing over the past 30 years, especially in the developed world, a number of discourses now compete for the status of the safest, most fulfilling birth experience. Supporters of biomedical and `natural' approaches make their respective claims to those, with obstetricians broadly aligning their professional interests with the former and midwives with the latter. There is mounting evidence that childbearing women's experiences of birth are often shaped in the uneasy space between the two. Within sociological discourse in health, embodiment is a dominant theme but, to date, research has concentrated mainly on new reproductive technologies, and there is a dearth of recent research and theorising around the act of parturition itself. This paper argues that because of this, there has been a polarising tendency in current discourses which is having a largely negative impact on women, professionals and the maternity services. A call is made for an integration of traditional childbirth embodiment theories, mediated through compassionate, relationally focused maternity care, especially when labour complications develop.	1	Denis J.

Schwadel, Philip. 2010. 'Age, Period, and Cohort Effects on Us Religious Service Attendance: the Declining Impact of Sex, Southern Residence, and Catholic Affiliation.' Sociology of Religion. 71:1 2-24.	Sociology of Religion	2010	7	I use repeated, cross-sectional data from 1972 to 2006 to analyze age, period, and cohort effects on Americans' frequency of religious service attendance with cross-classified, random-effects models. The results show that the frequency of religious service attendance is relatively stable, with a modest period-based decline in the 1990s and little overall cohort effect. Although aggregate rates of attendance are stable, there are large changes across cohorts and periods in differences in attendance between men and women, southerners and non-southerners, and Catholics and mainline Protestants. These results serve as a reminder that aggregate trends can mask substantial changes among specific groups, and that factors that strongly influence religious participation at one period or among one birth cohort may not be the same factors that affect participation at another time or among another cohort.	1	Philip Schwadel
Schieman, Scott. 2010. 'Socioeconomic Status and Beliefs About God's Influence in Everyday Life.' Sociology of Religion. 71:1 25-51.	Sociology of Religion	2010	11	This study examines the differences in beliefs about God's influence in everyday life across levels of socioeconomic status (SES) and whether that association is contingent upon religious involvement (i.e., frequency of praying, attendance, reading religious texts, and subjective religiosity). I focus specifically on the beliefs in divine involvement and divine control. Using data from two national 2005 surveys of Americans, I observe the following: (1) overall, SES is associated negatively with beliefs in divine involvement and control; (2) with the exception of reading religious texts, each indicator of religious involvement is associated with higher levels of beliefs in divine involvement or divine control; (3) SES interacts with each dimension of religious involvement such that the negative association between SES and divine involvement or control is attenuated at higher levels of religious involvement. I discuss the contributions of this research for theoretical perspectives on the relationship between SES and beliefs about God's influence in everyday life, underscoring the need to assess religious involvement in these processes.	1	Scott Schieman
Marti, Gerardo. 2010. 'Ego-affirming Evangelicalism: How a Hollywood Church Appropriates Religion for Workers in the Creative Class.' Sociology of Religion. 71:1 52-75.	Sociology of Religion	2010	3	The ``creative class'' is a growing stratum of American labor consisting of nomadic workers who master self-promotion for economic survival. Using ethnographic and interview data from a Los Angeles church with a majority of attenders working in the entertainment industry, the paper demonstrates how a congregation oriented around a softer form of Word of Faith/Prosperity theology provides moral guidance for creative class believers. Their personal pursuit of fame and fortune is viewed as a veneer for the real self who not only lives by God's standards but also interacts with broader society in solidarity with others in their moral community with the goal of fulfilling religious aspirations. The resulting ego-affirming evangelicalism suggests that congregations that accommodate individual ``greatness'' within a cohesive community will be embraced by creative class workers who seek both inspiration for daily work and consolation for the isolation and fatigue experienced through their occupational challenges.	1	Gerardo Marti
Heider, Anne & R. Warner. 2010. 'Bodies in Sync: Interaction Ritual Theory Applied to Sacred Harp Singing.' Sociology of Religion. 71:1 76-97.	Sociology of Religion	2010	5	This paper applies ``interaction ritual'' theory (Collins 2004) to the case of ``Sacred Harp'' singing in the United States. We first situate the paper in a tradition of theorizing traced to Durkheim's analysis of ``collective effervescence,'' the key to which is that instead of merely expressing social solidarity, physically intense rituals create it. Drawing on recent ethnographic literature as well as our observant participation, we depict Sacred Harp ritual. The music is sung loudly and with gusto, and singers employ their bodies both to produce the sound and to emphasize its significance. We apply Collins's theory to argue that Sacred Harp ritual produces solidarity in the absence of, or prior to, ideological consensus. Sacred Harp singers include evangelicals, atheists, and Jews, with a significant presence of gays and lesbians. Notwithstanding these differences, Sacred Harp constitutes a far-flung solidary community, an emergent shared identity that cross-cuts other, often conflicting identities. We close with suggestions for further applications of a promising theory.	2	Anne Heider; R. Stephen Warner
Kim, Sharon. 2010. 'Shifting Boundaries Within Second-generation Korean American Churches.' Sociology of Religion. 71:1 98-122.	Sociology of Religion	2010	1	This study, based on 108 interviews and participant observation at 22 churches, examines the tension among newly formed second-generation Korean American churches in Los Angeles over its ethnic boundaries. Although all of the newly formed churches are open to non-Koreans, not all envision or desire a multiracial church. First, some pastors want their churches to remain predominately Korean American because they believe that the church is the main institution responsible for preserving the Korean culture and passing it down to subsequent generations. Others want to stretch their boundaries to include all Asian Americans. They argue that the similarities in life experiences and cultural orientation, largely derived by their shared status as children of immigrants and as racial minorities in the United States, among different Asian American groups serve as the common denominator. Finally, several pastors are determined to transform their churches into multiracial congregations. Documenting the current stage of experimentation and transition, this study of second-generation churches provides important insights on the role of religion and religious organizations in immigrant adaptation and identity formation.	1	Sharon Kim
Plummer, Ken. 2010. 'Generational Sexualities, Subterranean Traditions, and the Hauntings of the Sexual World: Some Preliminary Remarks.' Symbolic Interaction. 33:2 163-190.	Symbolic Interaction	2010	6	In this article I argue that generation is a relatively neglected concept for thinking about both the social and the sexual, and that symbolic interactionism has much to offer in developing our understanding of this idea. Using both personal experience and the wide-ranging literature on sexualities, I explore the role of synchronic and diachronic time in organizing both the flow of sexual lives and the hierarchy of age-sexual orders. The core organizing concepts are those of generational sexualities and subterranean traditions; the approach is seen to provide a further complication to standpoint, queer, and intersectionality theory. The core of the article suggests an array of sensitizing concepts and research areas that might sharpen future analyses. Schematic and exploratory, the article draws from a wide range of examples.	1	Ken Plummer
Elliott, Sinikka. 2010. 'Parents' Constructions of Teen Sexuality: Sex Panics, Contradictory Discourses, and Social Inequality.' Symbolic Interaction. 33:2 191-212.	Symbolic Interaction	2010	9	Teen sexuality occupies a highly ambivalent and contradictory place in U.S. society. Teenagers are deemed too young to know about sex, but too sexually driven to be trusted with information. Teen sexual activity is portrayed as fraught with danger, yet sexuality is a pervasive aspect of the American cultural landscape and considered key to identity and fulfillment. Drawing on in-depth interviews with forty-seven parents of teenagers, this article explores how parents navigate these contradictory discourses in making sense of teen sexuality. The findings show that parents do not think of their own teenagers as sexually desiring subjects, even as they construct adolescents in general as highly sexual and sexually predatory, with gender, racial, and class signifiers woven through their descriptions. I argue that parents' binary thinking-constructing their teen children as asexual but other teens as hypersexual-represents more than simply an effort to maintain a notion of their teens as sexually innocent: it reveals deep anxieties about their teenagers' future life chances and underscores the prominent role sexuality plays in reproducing social inequality.	1	Sinikka Elliott
Hutson, David. 2010. 'Standing Out/fitting In: Identity, Appearance, and Authenticity in Gay and Lesbian Communities.' Symbolic Interaction. 33:2 213-233.	Symbolic Interaction	2010	1	Sexuality scholars have noted the historical connection between appearance and gay or lesbian identity. However, as the social landscape for lesbian women and gay men has shifted over the past forty years, little research has documented how such changes influence gay and lesbian individuals' appearance choices as they form, manage, and maintain their identities. To explore the impact of this ``post-closet'' (Seidman 2002) era on the identities and appearances of lesbians and gays, in-depth interviews were conducted with twenty individuals, aged eighteen to thirty. Findings suggest that while most people use appearance to attain a sense of authenticity after ``coming out,'' achieving a feeling of authenticity in gay and lesbian spaces presents unique challenges as individuals come under scrutiny by the community.	1	David J.

Adams, Tony. 2010. 'Paradoxes of Sexuality, Gay Identity, and the Closet.' Symbolic Interaction. 33:2 234-256.	Symbolic Interaction	2010	3	In this project, I illustrate how eight premises of sexuality, gay identity, and the closet contribute to the existence of paradox, an interactional situation constituted by contradiction. I first outline the following premises: gay identity is (1) inextricably tied to the metaphor of the closet; coming out is necessary when gay identity (2) is invisible; the closet draws meaning (3) only in relation to heteronormative contexts; gay identity, as a (4) stigmatized identity, makes coming out a (5) potentially dangerous act; coming out is conceived of as a (6) necessary and important, (7) discrete and linear, (8) inescapable and ever-present process. I then use autoethnography to describe and analyze the lived experience of paradox in terms of these premises. I conclude by formulating ways a gay person can negotiate paradox in, and by way of, interaction.	1	Tony E. Adams
Trautner, Mary & Jessica Collett. 2010. 'Students Who Strip: the Benefits of Alternate Identities for Managing Stigma.' Symbolic Interaction. 33:2 257-279.	Symbolic Interaction	2010	0	We apply interactionist theories that highlight the contextual nature of stigma and the relational quality of stigmatization to the case of college students who work as topless dancers. We explore how the ``toll of stripping'' might be mediated by having an alternate, positive identity like ``student.'' Our analysis demonstrates that students who strip are distinctive from other strippers in important ways that stem from their salient, positive identity as students. Although they often feel as if they live a ``double life'' because they hide their occupation from family and friends, they benefit from sharing their student goals and ambitions with club customers. ``Student'' is a socially acceptable identity to share in routine social interactions and helps student strippers frame dancing as a transient occupation, offering them an opportunity to maintain a positive sense of self while buffering them from some of the negative effects of stripping.	2	Mary Nell Trautner; Jessica L.

Barton, Bernadette & Constance Hardesty. 2010. 'Spirituality and Stripping: Exotic Dancers Narrate the Body Ekstasis.' Symbolic Interaction. 33:2 280-296.	Symbolic Interaction	2010	3	How does it feel to dance naked for money? Drawing on seven audio-taped interviews, this article examines how exotic dancers use the language of ``spirituality'' as a narrative resource. We suggest that exotic dancers who describe their time onstage as spiritual, at least temporarily, experience ``flow'' while dancing. Further, we argue that dancers' descriptions of flow and peak experiences represent what Mead (1934: 280) referred to as a ``fusion of the `I' and the `me.''' Given that informants themselves claimed a spiritual identity, we seek here to tease out what they mean by this, as well as how and why this occurred in a strip bar. We speculate that such narration results from a unique combination of elements present in strip bar environments, specifically the lights, music, movement, nudity, and performance.	2	Bernadette Barton; Constance L.

Waskul, Dennis & Justin Martin. 2010. 'Now the Orgy Is Over.' Symbolic Interaction. 33:2 297-318.	Symbolic Interaction	2010	0	Based on six months of ethnographic fieldwork, this study explores the intersections between embodied flesh and digital (re)presentations by examining how participants experience virtual sex on Second Life. We explore how and to what extent Second Life avatars mediate personal desires and fantasies with others who, collaboratively, construct sexual adventures in forms of playful deviance that allow for the emergence of secret sexual selves, as well as how those sexual adventures are ultimately fashioned and experienced in a ``diffused life'' that is neither of Second Life nor of first but a tightly bound combination of the two. Despite the enormous freedom of Second Life residents for seemingly boundless creative self-expression, we conclude that these experiences are more bound to and confined within disciplined practices than they first appear.	2	Dennis D.

Kumar, Krishan. 2010. 'Nation-states as Empires, Empires as Nation-states: Two Principles, One Practice?.' Theory and Society. 39:2 119-143.	Theory and Society	2010	5	Empires and nation-states are generally opposed to each other, as contrasting and antithetical forms. Nationalism is widely held to have been the solvent that dissolved the historic European empires. This paper argues that there are in fact, in practice at least, significant similarities between nation-states and empires. Many nation-states are in effect empires in miniature. Similarly, many empires can be seen as nation-states ``writ large.'' Moreover, empires were not, as is usually held, superseded by nation-states but continued alongside them. Empires and nation-states may in fact best be thought of as alternative political projects, both of which are available for elites to pursue depending on the circumstances of the moment. Ultimately empires and nation-states do point in different directions, but it is not clear that the future is a future of nation-states. Empires, as large-scale and long-lasting multiethnic and ``multicultural'' experiments, may have much to teach us in the current historical phase of globalization and increasingly heterogeneous societies.	1	Krishan Kumar
Friese, Carrie. 2010. 'Classification Conundrums: Categorizing Chimeras and Enacting Species Preservation.' Theory and Society. 39:2 145-172.	Theory and Society	2010	5	Sociologists have challenged the discipline to account for and incorporate biological factors in their analyses. Heeding this call, this article asks how chimeras, a particularly puzzling biological organism, are being officially classified in the interrelated sites of endangered species preservation and the zoo. Based on a qualitative study of endeavors to clone endangered animals, I contend that biology alone cannot determine the classification of these interspecies organisms. Rather, categorizing chimeras requires metaphoric, schematic references to more familiar entities. Here culture and biology are tools for classification, which has consequences for preservation practices and the materiality of endangered wildlife. Drawing on the sociology of culture, I show that positions on classification represent an intermediary space for interpreting the relationship between meaning and action in discourse elaboration. Building on the sociology of science and technology, I show the epistemological limitations of understanding the biological as an a priori factor.	1	Carrie Friese
Steinberg, Marc. 2010. 'Marx, Formal Subsumption and the Law.' Theory and Society. 39:2 173-202.	Theory and Society	2010	0	Recent work rethinking the place of the law in Marxian analysis of capitalist society provides us with a foundation for a renewed look at the labor process. Drawing on this literature, which emphasizes the materiality of institutions through which labor is exploited, and returning to Marx's discussion of formal subsumption in Capital, I argue that the law was central for subordinating labor. I then present three case studies from industries in Victorian England to demonstrate the diverse ways in which law was implicated in formal subsumption. The case studies focus on the ways in which capitalists used master and servant law, the key law governing the workplace, to subordinate labor. I conclude by considering how these cases provoke us to consider the materiality of the law in labor relations more broadly, and such questions might be pursued in developing capitalist economies such as China.	1	Marc W.

Vargha, Zsuzsanna. 2010. 'Educate or Serve: the Paradox of ``professional Service'' and the Image of the West in Legitimacy Battles of Post-socialist Advertising.' Theory and Society. 39:2 203-243.	Theory and Society	2010	0	This article investigates a puzzle in the rapidly evolving profession of advertising in post-socialist Hungary: young professionals who came of age during the shift to market-driven practices want to produce advertising that is uncompromised by clients and consumers, and to educate others about western modernity. It is their older colleagues-trained during customer-hostile socialism-who emphasize that good professionals serve their clients' needs. These unexpected generational positions show that 1) professions are more than groups expanding their jurisdiction. They are fields structured by two conflicting demands: autonomy of expertise and dependence on clients. We can explain the puzzle by noting that actors are positioning themselves on one or the other side based on their trajectory or movement in the field relative to other actors. Old and new groups vie for power in the transforming post-socialist professional field, responding to each other's claims and vulnerabilities, exploiting the professional field's contradictory demands on its actors. 2) The struggle is not between those who are oriented to the west and those that are not. Rather, the west is both the means and the stake of the struggle over historical continuity and professional power. Imposing a definition of the west is almost the same as imposing a definition of the profession on the field. In this historical case, ``field'' appears less as a stable structure based on actors' equipment with capital, than as dynamic relations moved forward by contestation of the field's relevant capital.	1	Zsuzsanna Vargha
Collins, Patricia. 2010. 'the New Politics of Community.' American Sociological Review. 75:1 7-30.	American Sociological Review	2010	8	Ideas about community are especially prominent in late-twentieth-century U.S. society. The term community resonates throughout social policy, scholarship, popular culture, and everyday social interactions. It holds significance for different populations with competing political agendas (e. g., political groups of the right and the left invoke ideas of community yet have very different ideas in mind). No longer seen as naturally occurring, apolitical spaces to which one retreats to escape the pressures of modern life, communities of all sorts now constitute sites of political engagement and contestation. The new politics of community reveals how the idea of community constitutes an elastic political construct that holds a variety of contradictory meanings and around which diverse social practices occur. In this address, I analyze how reframing the idea of community as a political construct might provide new avenues for investigating social inequalities. I first explore the utility of community as a political construct for rethinking both intersecting systems of power and activities that are routinely characterized as `political.'' Next, by examining five contemporary sites where community is either visibly named as a political construct or implicated in significant political phenomena, I investigate how the construct of community operates within contemporary power relations of class, gender, ethnicity, sexuality, age, ability, nation, and race. Finally, I explore the potential intellectual and political significance of these developments.	1	Patricia Hill Collins

American Sociological Review	2010	6	This article uses Academy Award nominations for acting to explore how artistic achievement is situated within a collaborative context. Assessment of individual effort is particularly difficult in film because quality is not transparent, but the project-based nature of the field allows us to observe individuals in multiple collaborative contexts. We address these issues with analyses of the top-10 credited roles from films released in theaters between 1936 and 2005. Controlling for an actor's personal history and the basic traits of a film, we explore two predictions. First, we find that status, as measured by asymmetric centrality in the network of screen credits, is an efficient measure of star power and mediates the relationship between experience and formal artistic consecration. Second, we find that actors are most likely to be consecrated when working with elite collaborators. We conclude by arguing that selection into privileged work teams provides cumulative advantage.	3	Gabriel Rossman; Nicole Esparza; Phillip Bonacich

American Sociological Review	2010	50	The study of institutional myths has been central to organizational sociology, cultural sociology, and the sociology of education for 30 years. This article examines how the myth concept has been used and develops neglected possibilities by asking: What happens when myths become incarnate, and how does this occur? In other words, what happens when conformity to a rationalized cultural ideal such as ``accountability'' is no longer symbolic but is given tangible flesh? Data from a two-year ethnography of an urban elementary school provide answers and reveal ``recoupling'' processes through which institutional myths and organizational practices that were once loosely connected become tightly linked. In the school studied here, recoupling accountability with classroom practices created a phenomenon that teachers labeled ``turmoil.'' The findings advance our understanding of the micro-sociological foundations of institutional theory by ``inhabiting'' institutionalism with people, their work activities, social interactions, and meaning-making processes.	1	Tim Hallett

American Sociological Review	2010	8	More than four decades ago, the Kerner Report chronicled the violent disturbances of the 1960s and predicted that the United States was rapidly moving toward two racially separate and unequal societies. Resulting concerns about black and white inequality form a critical chapter in the history of sociological research. Few studies, however, explore trends in racial inequality in rates of violence. Has the gap between black and white violence rates significantly narrowed since 1960 and, if so, why? Drawing on recent work on assimilation and the literature on race inequality, we develop a set of hypotheses about black-white differences in violence rates and how these rates may have changed during the past four decades. We emphasize race differences in family structure, economic and educational inequality, residential integration, illicit drug involvement, and population composition. Using race-specific homicide arrest and census data on social, economic, and demographic conditions for 80 large U. S. cities from 1960 to 2000, we find substantial convergence in black-white homicide arrest rates over time, although this convergence stalled from the 1980s to the 1990s. Consistent with theoretical expectations, we find that, since the 1960s, the racial gap in homicide arrests declined more substantially in cities that had greater reductions in the ratio of black to white single-parent families, as well as in cities that experienced greater population growth and increases in the proportion of the population that is black. Also, as expected, the race gap in homicide arrests widened in cities that had an increasing ratio of black to white rates of drug arrests. Measures of racial integration, however, have no discernible impact on the black to white homicide arrest ratio.	3	Gary LaFree; Eric P. Baumer; Robert O'Brien
Eichenlaub, Suzanne, Stewart Tolnay & J. Alexander. 2010. 'Moving Out but Not Up: Economic Outcomes in the Great Migration.' American Sociological Review. 75:1 101-125.	American Sociological Review	2010	9	The migration of millions of southerners out of the South between 1910 and 1970 is largely attributed to economic and social push factors in the South, combined with pull factors in other regions of the country. Researchers generally find that participants in this migration were positively selected from their region of origin, in terms of educational attainment and urban status, and that they fared relatively well in their destinations. To fully measure the migrants' success, however, a comparison with those who remained in the South is necessary. This article uses data from the U.S. Census to compare migrants who left the South with their southern contemporaries who stayed behind, both those who moved within the South and the sedentary population. The findings indicate that migrants who left the South did not benefit appreciably in terms of employment status, income, or occupational status. In fact, inter-regional migrants often fared worse than did southerners who moved within the South or those who remained sedentary. These results contradict conventional wisdom regarding the benefits of exiting the South and suggest the need for a revisionist interpretation of the experiences of those who left.	3	Suzanne C.

American Sociological Review	2010	10	This article examines social stratification in individual health trajectories for multiple cohorts in the context of China's dramatically changing macro-social environment. Using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, we find significant socioeconomic status (SES) differences in the mean level of health and that these SES differentials generally diverge over the life course. We also find strong cohort variations in SES disparities in the mean levels of health and health trajectories. The effect of education on health slightly decreases across successive cohorts. By contrast, the income gap in health trajectories diverges for earlier cohorts but converges for most recent cohorts. Both effects are more pronounced in rural areas. Given that these cohort effects are opposite those reported in recent U.S. studies, we discuss China's unique social, economic, and political settings. We highlight the association between SES and health behaviors, China's stage of epidemiologic transition, and the changing power of the state government and its implications for health care.	3	Feinian Chen; Yang Yang; Guangya Liu

American Sociological Review	2010	3	Despite decades of research on the benefits of educational expectations, researchers have failed to show that unrealized plans are consequential for mental health, as self-discrepancy and other social psychological theories would predict. This article uses two national longitudinal studies of youth to test whether unrealized educational expectations are associated with depression in adulthood. Negative binomial regression analyses show that unmet expectations are associated with a greater risk of depression among young adults who share similar educational expectations. The apparent consequences of aiming high and falling short result, however, from lower attainment, not the gap between plans and attainment. Results indicate almost no long-term emotional costs of ``shooting for the stars'' rather than planning for the probable, once educational attainment is taken into account. This lack of association also holds after accounting for early mental health, the magnitude of the shortfall, the stability of expectations, and college-related resources, and it is robust across two distinct cohorts of high school students. We develop a theory of ``adaptive resilience'' to account for these findings and, because aiming high and failing are not consequential for mental health, conclude that society should not dissuade unpromising students from dreams of college.	2	John R.

Harris, Kathleen. 2010. 'an Integrative Approach to Health.' Demography. 47:1 1-22.	Demography	2010	16	In this article, I make the case for using an integrative approach to health, broadly defined as social, emotional, mental, and physical well-being; for studying health among the young as an important marker for future health and well-being across the life course; and for understanding health disparities among the young as both causes and consequences of social stratification. An integrative approach bridges biomedical sciences with social and behavioral sciences by understanding the linkages between social, behavioral, psychological, and biological factors in health. It is furthermore vital that integration occur in all steps of the research process: in theory design, data collection, and analysis. I use the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, or Add Health, as an example of an integrative approach to health and of the importance of adolescence and the transition to adulthood years for setting health trajectories into adulthood.

Demography	2010	5	Few studies have examined the effects of early life conditions on the timing of the onset of heart disease. We use the remarkable example of a representative sample of the population of older Puerto Ricans aged 60-74 who lived in the countryside during childhood (n = 1,438) to examine the effects of seasonal exposures to poor nutrition and infectious diseases during late gestation on the timing of the onset and the probability of ever experiencing adult heart disease. Cox and log logistic hazard models controlling for childhood conditions (self-reported childhood health status and socioeconomic status [SES], rheumatic fever, and knee height) and adult risk factors (adult SES, obesity, smoking, exercise, and self-reported diabetes) showed that the risk of onset of heart disease was 65\% higher among those born during high-exposure periods compared with unexposed individuals. However, there were no significant differences in median time of onset for those ever experiencing heart disease. As a comparison, we found that there were no significant seasonality effects for those who lived in urban areas during childhood. We conclude that early exposures in utero have important ramifications for adult heart disease among the older Puerto Rican population. We show, however that while exposure is associated with the probability of ever experiencing adult heart disease, it is not associated with the timing of onset among those who do experience it.	2	Mary McEniry; Alberto Palloni
Costa, Dora & Matthew Kahn. 2010. 'Health, Wartime Stress, and Unit Cohesion: Evidence From Union Army Veterans.' Demography. 47:1 45-66.	Demography	2010	3	We find that Union Army veterans of the American Civil War who faced greater wartime stress (as measured by higher battlefield mortality rates) experienced higher mortality rates at older ages, but that men who were from more cohesive companies were statistically significantly less likely to be affected by wartime stress. Our results hold for overall mortality, mortality from ischemic heart disease and stroke, and new diagnoses of arteriosclerosis. Our findings represent one of the first long-run health follow-ups of the interaction between stress and social networks in a human population in which both stress and social networks are arguably exogenous.	2	Dora L.

Dowd, Kevin, David Blake & Andrew Cairns. 2010. 'Facing Up to Uncertain Life Expectancy: the Longevity Fan Charts.' Demography. 47:1 67-78.	Demography	2010	8	This article uses longevity fan charts to represent the uncertainty in projections of future life expectancy. These fan charts are based on a mortality model calibrated on mortality data for English and Welsh males. The fan charts indicate strong upward sloping trends in future life expectancy. Their widths indicate the extent of uncertainty in these projections, and this uncertainty increases as the forecast horizon lengthens. Allowing for uncertainty in the parameter values of the model adds further to uncertainty in life expectancy projections. The article also illustrates how longevity fan charts can be used to stress-test longevity outcomes.	3	Kevin Dowd; David Blake; Andrew J. Cairns
Monteverde, Malena, Kenya Noronha, Alberto Palloni & Beatriz Novak. 2010. 'Obesity and Excess Mortality Among the Elderly in the United States and Mexico.' Demography. 47:1 79-96.	Demography	2010	8	Increasing levels of obesity could compromise future gains in life expectancy in low- and high-income countries. Although excess mortality associated with obesity and, more generally, higher levels of body mass index (BMI) have been investigated in the United States, there is little research about the impact of obesity on mortality in Latin American countries, where very the rapid rate of growth of prevalence of obesity and overweight occur jointly with poor socioeconomic conditions. The aim of this article is to assess the magnitude of excess mortality due to obesity and overweight in Mexico and the United States. For this purpose, we take advantage of two comparable data sets: the Health and Retirement Study 2000 and 2004 for the United States, and the Mexican Health and Aging Study 2001 and 2003 for Mexico. We find higher excess mortality risks among obese and overweight individuals aged 60 and older in Mexico than in the United States. Yet, when analyzing excess mortality among different socioeconomic strata, we observe greater gaps by education in the United States than in Mexico. We also find that although the probability of experiencing obesity-related chronic diseases among individuals with high BMI is larger for the U.S. elderly, the relative risk of dying conditional on experiencing these diseases is higher in Mexico.	4	Malena Monteverde; Kenya Noronha; Alberto Palloni; Beatriz Novak
Retherford, Robert, Naohiro Ogawa, Rikiya Matsukura & Hassan Eini-Zinab. 2010. 'Multivariate Analysis of Parity Progression-based Measures of the Total Fertility Rate and Its Components.' Demography. 47:1 97-124.	Demography	2010	5	This article describes a methodology for applying a discrete-time survival model-the complementary log-log model-to estimate effects of socioeconomic variables on (1) the total fertility rate and its components and (2) trends in the total fertility rate and its components. For the methodology to be applicable, the total fertility rate (TFR) must be calculated from parity progression ratios (PPRs). The components of the TFR are PPRs, the total marital fertility rate (TWR), and the TFR itself as measures of the quantum of fertility, and mean and median ages at first marriage and mean and median closed birth intervals by birth order as measures of the tempo or timing of fertility. The focus is on effects of predictor variables on these measures rather than on coefficients, which are often difficult to interpret in the complex models that are considered. The methodology is applicable to both period and cohort data. It is illustrated by application to data from the 1993, 1998, and 2003 Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in the Philippines.	4	Robert Retherford; Naohiro Ogawa; Rikiya Matsukura; Hassan Eini-Zinab
Graff, Mariaelisa, Kathryn Yount, Usha Ramakrishnan, Reynaldo Martorell & Aryeh Stein. 2010. 'Childhood Nutrition and Later Fertility: Pathways Through Education and Pre-pregnant Nutritional Status.' Demography. 47:1 125-144.	Demography	2010	1	Better childhood nutrition is associated with earlier physical maturation during adolescence and increased schooling attainment. However, as earlier onset of puberty and increased schooling can have opposing effects on fertility, the net effect of improvements in childhood nutrition on a woman fertility are uncertain. Using path analysis, we estimate the strength of the pathways between childhood growth and subsequent fertility outcomes in Guatemalan women studied prospectively since birth. Height for age z score at 24 months was positively related to body mass index (BMI kg/m(2)) and height (cm) in adolescence and to schooling attainment. BMI was negatively associated (-0.23 +/- 0.09 years per kg/m(2); p < .05) and schooling was positively associated (0.38 +/- 0.06 years per grade; p <. 001) with age at first birth. Total associations with the number of children born were positive from BMI (0.07 +/- 0.02 per kg/m(2); p <. 05) and negative from schooling (-0.18 +/- 0.02 per grade; p <. 01). Height was not related to age at first birth or the number of children born. Taken together childhood nutrition, as reflected by height at 2 years, was positively associated with delayed age at first birth and fewer children born. If schooling is available for girls, increased growth during childhood will most likely result in a net decrease infertility.	5	Mariaelisa Graff; Kathryn M.

Demography	2010	13	This article tests whether parents reinforce or compensate for child endowments. We estimate how the difference in birth weight across siblings impacts specific parental investments: breast-feeding, well-baby visits, immunizations, and preschool attendance. Our results indicate that normal-birth-weight children are 5\%-11\% more likely to receive early childhood parental investments than their low-birth-weight siblings. Moreover, the presence of additional low-birth-weight siblings in the household increases the likelihood of investments such as well-baby visits and immunizations for normal-birth-weight children. These results suggest that parental investments in early childhood tend to reinforce endowment differences.	3	Ashlesha Datar; M. Rebecca Kilburn; David S. Loughran

Demography	2010	9	This article presents unique evidence that orphanhood matters in the long run for health and education outcomes in a region of northwestern Tanzania. We study a sample of 718 non-orphaned children surveyed in 1991-1994 who were traced and re interviewed as adults in 2004. A large proportion, 19\%, lost one or more parents before age 15 in this period, allowing us to assess permanent health and education impacts of orphanhood In the analysis, we control for a wide range of child and adult characteristics before orphanhood, as well as community fixed effects. We find that maternal orphanhood has a permanent adverse impact of 2 cm of final height attainment and one year of educational attainment. Expressing welfare in terms of consumption expenditure, the result is a gap of 8.5\% compared with similar children whose mothers survived until at least their 15th birthday.	3	Kathleen Beegle; Joachim De; Stefan Dercon
Tach, Laura, Ronald Mincy & Kathryn Edin. 2010. 'Parenting as a ``package Deal'': Relationships, Fertility, and Nonresident Father Involvement Among Unmarried Parents.' Demography. 47:1 181-204.	Demography	2010	29	Fatherhood has traditionally been viewed as part of a ``package deal'' in which a father relationship with his child is contingent on his relationship with the mother We evaluate the accuracy of this hypothesis in light of the high rates of multiple-partner fertility among unmarried parents using the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, a recent longitudinal survey of nonmarital births in large cities. We examine whether unmarried mothers `and fathers' subsequent relationship and parenting transitions are associated with declines in fathers' contact with their nonresident biological children. We find that father involvement drops sharply after relationships between unmarried parents end. Mothers' transitions into new romantic partnerships and new parenting roles are associated with larger declines in involvement than fathers' transitions. Declines in fathers' involvement following a mother relationship or parenting transition are largest when children are young. We discuss the implications of our results for the well-being of nonmarital children and the quality of nonmarital relationships faced with high levels of relationship instability and multiple-partner fertiliy.	3	Laura Tach; Ronald Mincy; Kathryn Edin
Cheadle, Jacob, Paul Amato & Valarie King. 2010. 'Patterns of Nonresident Father Contact.' Demography. 47:1 205-225.	Demography	2010	19	We used the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 cohort (NLSY79)from 1979 to 2002 and the Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (CNLSY) from 1986 to 2002 to describe the number, shape, and population frequencies of U.S. nonresident father contact trajectories over a 14-year period using growth mixture models. The resulting four-category classification indicated that nonresident father involvement is not adequately characterized by a single population with a monotonic pattern of declining contact over time. Contrary to expectations, about two-thirds of fathers were consistently either highly involved or rarely involved in their children lives. Only one group, constituting approximately 23\% of fathers, exhibited a clear pattern of declining contact. In addition, a small group of fathers (8\%) displayed a pattern of increasing contact. A variety of variables differentiated between these groups, including the child age at father-child separation, whether the child was born within marriage, the mother education, the mother age at birth, whether the father pays child support regularly, and the geographical distance between fathers and children.	3	Jacob E.

Couch, Kenneth & Robert Fairlie. 2010. 'Last Hired, First Fired? Black-white Unemployment and the Business Cycle.' Demography. 47:1 227-247.	Demography	2010	5	Studies have tested the claim that blacks are the last hired during periods of economic growth and the first fired in recessions by examining the movement of relative unemployment rates over the business cycle. Any conclusion drawn from this type of analysis must be viewed as tentative because cyclical movements in the underlying transitions into and out of unemployment are not examined Using Current Population Survey data matched across adjacent months from 1989-2004, this article provides the first detailed examination of labor market transitions for prime-age black and white men to test the last hired, first fired hypothesis. Considerable evidence is presented that blacks are the first fired as the business cycle weakens. However, no evidence is found that blacks are the last hired Instead, blacks appear to be initially hired from the ranks of the unemployed early in the business cycle and later are drawn from nonparticipation. The narrowing of the racial unemployment gap near the peak of the business cycle is driven by a reduction in the rate of job loss for blacks rather than increases in hiring.	2	Kenneth A.

Echavarri, Rebeca & Roberto Ezcurra. 2010. 'Education and Gender Bias in the Sex Ratio at Birth: Evidence From India.' Demography. 47:1 249-268.	Demography	2010	4	This article investigates the possible existence of a nonlinear link between female disadvantage in natality and education. To this end, we devise a theoretical model based on the key role of social interaction in explaining people acquisition of preferences, which justifies the existence of a non-monotonic relationship between female disadvantage in natality and education. The empirical validity of the proposed model is examined for the case of India, using district-level data. In this context, our econometric analysis pays particular attention to the role of spatial dependence to avoid any potential problems of misspecification. The results confirm that the relationship between the sex ratio at birth and education in India follows an inverted U-shape. This finding is robust to the inclusion of additional explanatory variables in the analysis, and to the choice of the spatial weight matrix used to quantify the spatial interdependence between the sample districts.	2	Rebeca A.

Bridges, Tristan. 2010. 'Men Just Weren't Made to Do This Performances of Drag at ``walk a Mile in Her Shoes'' Marches.' Gender \& Society. 24:1 5-30.	Gender \& Society	2010	0	Though there is a vast literature on performances of drag, performances of gender and sexual transgressions outside of drag clubs are less studied. This case study of men's marches protesting violence against women-''Walk a Mile in Her Shoes'' marches-examines the politics of such transgressions. Cross-dressing to various degrees is strategically utilized at these events in an attempt to encourage men to become empathetic allies. This article suggests, however, that context is critical to the political potential of performances of drag. The author's observations of the interactions at the marches suggest that drag at ``Walk a Mile'' marches often symbolically reproduces gender and sexual inequality despite good intentions. At these marches, feminism is gendered when performances of politics and protest are contextually framed as gender and/or sexual transgressions when ``feminism'' is understood as ``feminine.''	1	Tristan S.

Connell, Catherine. 2010. 'Doing, Undoing, or Redoing Gender? Learning From the Workplace Experiences of Transpeople.' Gender \& Society. 24:1 31-55.	Gender \& Society	2010	5	Drawing from the perspectives of transgender individuals, this article offers an empirical investigation of recent critiques of West and Zimmerman's ``doing gender'' theory. This analysis uses 19 in-depth interviews with transpeople about their negotiation and management of gendered interactions at work to explore how their experiences potentially contribute to the doing, undoing, or redoing of gender in the workplace. I find that transpeople face unique challenges in making interactional sense of their sex, gender, and sex category and simultaneously engage in doing, undoing, and redoing gender in the process of managing these challenges. Consequently, I argue that their interactional gender accomplishments are not adequately captured under the rubric of ``doing gender'' and suggest instead that they be understood as ``doing transgender.'' This article outlines the process of and consequences of ``doing transgender'' and its potential implications for the experience of and transformation of gender inequality at work.	1	Catherine Connell
Irvine, Leslie & Jenny Vermilya. 2010. 'Gender Work in a Feminized Profession the Case of Veterinary Medicine.' Gender \& Society. 24:1 56-82.	Gender \& Society	2010	10	Veterinary medicine has undergone dramatic, rapid feminization while in many ways remaining gendered masculine. With women constituting approximately half of its practitioners and nearly 80 percent of students, veterinary medicine is the most feminized of the comparable health professions. Nevertheless, the culture of veterinary medicine glorifies stereotypically masculine actions and attitudes. This article examines how women veterinarians understand the gender dynamics within the profession. Our analysis reveals that the discursive strategies available to women sustain and justify the status quo, and thus preserve hegemonic masculinity. Women use strategies previously used toward female tokens in nontraditional jobs, such as role encapsulation, and strategies previously used by male tokens in traditionally female jobs, such as distancing from the feminine. Through this discursive ``gender work,'' women help to maintain the institutionalized inequality and the masculine ethic of the profession. Veterinary medicine illustrates the importance of considering organizational context in studies of feminization.	2	Leslie Irvine; Jenny R. Vermilya
Esacove, Anne. 2010. 'Love Matches Heteronormativity, Modernity, and Aids Prevention in Malawi.' Gender \& Society. 24:1 83-109.	Gender \& Society	2010	3	This article identifies the dominant public narrative of AIDS in Malawi through an analysis of qualitative interview data and policy and intervention materials. The public narrative creates distinctions between ``risky'' and ``healthy'' sex that organize HIV prevention efforts around moral categories, rather than relative risk. These distinctions oppose images of backward, ignorant villagers to the protective power of ``love matches'' (loving heterosexual relationships between equals). The analysis demonstrates that the public narrative and corresponding prevention efforts only make sense in connection with the patently false assumption that love, heterosexuality, and modernity effectively protect individuals from HIV. This research brings to light the unspoken assumptions of modernity in the (Western) ``charmed circle'' of heteronormativity, as well as the need to consider the workings of heteronormativity in studies of modernization and globalization. Furthermore, it highlights individualistic and oversimplified analytic models currently directing HIV prevention efforts and points to potentially more effective strategies.	1	Anne W. Esacove
Currier, Ashley. 2010. 'Political Homophobia in Postcolonial Namibia.' Gender \& Society. 24:1 110-129.	Gender \& Society	2010	4	The South West African People's Organisation (SWAPO) delivered Namibia from South African apartheid rule in 1990. Namibia's democratic future began with the promise of equality. In 1995, however, SWAPO initiated a campaign of political homophobia. In this article, I make a case for viewing SWAPO leaders' deployment of political homophobia as a gendered political strategy. I draw on a qualitative analysis of 194 articles from Namibian newspapers published between 1995 and 2006. My analysis illustrates two features of political homophobia. First, I demonstrate how political homophobia stifled political dissent and enhanced SWAPO leaders' masculinist position and legacy as liberators. Second, I show how SWAPO leaders used political homophobia to expel gender and sexual dissidents from official accounts of history.	1	Ashley Currier
Fletcher, Robert. 2010. 'the Emperor's New Adventure: Public Secrecy and the Paradox of Adventure Tourism.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 39:1 6-33.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	7	This study suggests that successful commercial adventure tourism requires the construction of a ``public secret''-something commonly known but not articulated-whereby tourists are able to maintain the contradictory perceptions that they are simultaneously safe and at risk. Previous research has observed that adventure tourism appears to embody a paradox in its attempt to deliver a planned, controlled version of an activity usually defined as dangerous and unpredictable. In order to explain how adventure tourism can succeed despite this paradox, researchers suggested that providers emphasize one aspect of the paradox ( risk or safety) while concealing the other. By contrast, the author contends that providers attempt to sell both risk and safety simultaneously, a situation sustained by the fact that the inconsistency between these images, while openly displayed, remains veiled by public secrecy. The author illustrates this analysis through ethnographic research undertaken on whitewater rafting trips in California and Chile.	1	Robert Fletcher
Anderson, Leon & Jimmy Taylor. 2010. 'Standing Out While Fitting In: Serious Leisure Identities and Aligning Actions Among Skydivers and Gun Collectors.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 39:1 34-59.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	6	Serious leisure communities have proliferated over the past century, providing ever more opportunities for people to enact and embrace leisure-related identities. Serious leisure offers individuals resources to distinguish themselves by developing specialized knowledge, skills, and experiences. But members of serious leisure communities may also feel marginalized when they perceive themselves and their activities as misunderstood by the broader society. This article draws on data from field studies of recreational skydivers and gun collectors to examine key features of serious leisure identities created in these masculinized leisure communities. The authors then describe skydivers' and gun collectors' perceptions that they are stereotyped and misunderstood in the broader culture. The authors go on to examine several types of aligning actions through which members of these leisure communities endeavor, individually and collectively, to negotiate their identities, organizations, and activities within the broader society. In the process, the authors highlight interpretive strategies of significance to the study of serious leisure activities more generally.	2	Leon Anderson; Jimmy D. Taylor

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	3	This study of a Northeastern alternative high school examines the salience of two discourses-one focused on students who have problems, the other on students who are problems-in the alternative schooling process. At Cromwell Alternative North (CAN), teachers and staff promoted a view of students as youth with ``special needs.'' In the students' social world, having ``special needs'' was not awarded status like being a troublemaker was. Students at CAN therefore had to manage both discourses in their daily interaction with teachers and peers. Some students accepted special needs rhetoric, some rejected it. Most attempted to manage it creatively, being a problem in the eyes of peers and having problems in the eyes of teachers. Code switching between the two discourses, however, was not something all students could do. A handful of students-''shining stars''-managed both ``SPED,'' slang for special education students, and ``bad'' discourses to achieve the greatest social and academic successes at CAN.	1	Sarah Becker
Athens, Lonnie. 2010. 'Naturalistic Inquiry in Theory and Practice.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 39:1 87-125.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	3	Herbert Blumer sought to develop ``naturalistic inquiry'' to provide sociologists, especially those who subscribe to the perspective known as ``symbolic interactionism,'' with an alternative methodology to positivism for them to use in their research. Since Blumer died before he could complete the job, an attempt is made to finish the work that he left undone on the method of naturalistic inquiry along the lines originally envisioned by him. Among other things, more details are provided to help researchers to carry out the two stages of naturalistic inquiry that he identified: ``exploration'' and ``inspection.'' A third stage, confirmation, is also added to the method. Although Blumer described naturalistic inquiry only in theory, it is described here both in theory and actual practice, which is essential to make the method more understandable to others. In addition to providing a more complete statement of naturalistic inquiry, the ideas that he drew on to develop the method are revealed. Several myths surrounding the method and the grounded theories that can be potentially developed from using it are also exposed. Finally, the case is made that naturalistic inquiry occupies a relatively unique position in the social sciences.	1	Lonnie Athens
Biblarz, Timothy & Judith Stacey. 2010. 'How Does the Gender of Parents Matter?.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:1 3-22.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	46	Claims that children need both a mother and father presume that women and men parent differently in ways crucial to development but generally rely on studies that conflate gender with other family structure variables. We analyze findings from studies with designs that mitigate these problems by comparing 2-parent families with same or different sex coparents and single-mother with single-father families. Strengths typically associated with married mother-father families appear to the same extent in families with 2 mothers and potentially in those with 2 fathers. Average differences favor women over men, but parenting skills are not dichotomous or exclusive. The gender of parents correlates in novel ways with parent-child relationships but has minor significance for children's psychological adjustment and social success.	2	Timothy J.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	10	This paper unites quantitative and qualitative data from the College Social Life Survey (n = 732) to describe and explain patterns of racial homophily in undergraduate sexual/romantic relationships at an elite university, a closed social setting. It expands the literature on interracial romantic unions by comparing homophily in hookups ( uncommitted sexual interactions), dates, and long-term relationships. Although this population embodies many characteristics associated with greater racial mixing ( youth, education, status equality, geographical proximity, racial diversity, independence from family), racial homophily is still strongly evident. Variation in levels of homophily among relationship types and among racial groups is explained by differences in desired homophily, social network segregation, and participation in formal race-based student organizations. Black students are particularly socially isolated.	1	Elizabeth Aura McClintock

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	7	The process of courtship and marriage in sub-Saharan Africa has changed remarkably. These changes, however, have received scant attention because recent research has focused on adolescent relationships' links to HIV/AIDS rather than to marriage. Drawing on detailed reports of 1,365 romantic and sexual partnerships from youths in Kisumu, Kenya, we found that marital aspirations, school enrollment, emotional attraction, pregnancy, and independence from kin are all predictors of getting engaged or married. Furthermore, though men and women are much more likely to marry partners they believe are sexually exclusive, men who have multiple partners are actually more likely to get married. By focusing on the contemporary process of marriage, this paper offers an alternative portrayal of premarital relationships in sub-Saharan Africa.	3	Shelley Clark; Caroline Kabiru; Rohini Mathur

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	10	Data from 4,855 respondents to the Panel Study of Income Dynamics were used to examine spatial and temporal dimensions of the effect of neighborhood poverty on teenage premarital childbearing. Although high poverty in the immediate neighborhood increased the risk of becoming an unmarried parent, high poverty in surrounding neighborhoods reduced this risk. The effect of local neighborhood poverty was especially pronounced when surrounding neighborhoods were economically advantaged. Measuring exposure to neighborhood poverty over the childhood life course yielded stronger effects than measuring exposure at a single age. Neither racial differences in the level of poverty in proximate neighborhoods nor racial differences in neighborhood poverty over the childhood life course explained the racial difference in nonmarital fertility.	2	Scott J.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	13	Cohabitation with a romantic partner has become common in recent decades. This meta-analysis examined the link between premarital cohabitation and marital stability (k = 16) and marital quality ( k = 12). Cohabitation had a significant negative association with both marital stability and marital quality. The negative predictive effect on marital stability, however, did not remain when only cohabitation with the eventual marital partner was analyzed, suggesting that these cohabitors may attach more long-term meaning to living together. Moderator analyses demonstrated that effects of cohabitation have remained consistent over time, despite the fact that cohabitation has become more normative.	3	Anita Jose; K.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	2	We investigated how intergenerational congruence in family-related attitudes depends on life course stage in young adulthood. Recent data from the Netherlands Kinship Panel Study were used; the present sample included 2,041 dyads of young adults and their parents. Findings are discussed in terms of the elasticity in intergenerational attitude congruence in response to young adults' life course transitions. Our results suggest that intergenerational congruence in attitudes about partnership ( e. g., marriage, cohabitation, divorce, women's and men's family roles) decreases after young adults have left the parental home and increases when young adults enter parenthood. Congruence concerning intergenerational obligations was not related to young adults' life course stage.	3	Freek Bucx; Quinten Raaijmakers; Frits Wel

Extending research in this area, this study examined dynamic-longitudinal pathways among husbands' and wives' depressive symptoms and marital satisfaction as a moderator of associations. Participants were 296 heterosexual couples. Husbands and wives reported on their depressive symptoms and marital satisfaction. Results from dynamic bivariate latent difference score analyses indicated unidirectional longitudinal coupling such that higher levels of husbands' depressive symptoms predicted subsequent elevations in wives' depressive symptoms over time. This relation was stronger among couples reporting marital distress as compared to couples reporting higher marital satisfaction. The findings underscore the importance of considering one's spouses' depressive symptoms in treatment efforts.	2	Chrystyna D. Kouros; E. Mark Cummings

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	1	The study adapts theories of the household division of labor to the division of parent care between spouses and expands them by taking the kin relationship with the parent and the intensity of care into account. Tobit and weighted logit models are used to analyze the division of parent care in 2,214 couples from the British General Household Surveys. The models revealed patterns of parent care that are predominantly governed by the kin relationship. Time availability was strongly associated with couples' division of parent care, whereas the resource-bargaining approach received little support except for dual-earner couples that provided more intensive care for the husband's parents.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	7	Despite increasing family studies research on same-sex cohabiters and families, the literature is virtually devoid of transgender and transsexual families. To bridge this gap, I present qualitative research narratives on household labor and emotion work from 50 women partners of transgender and transsexual men. Contrary to much literature on ``same-sex'' couples, the division of household labor and emotion work within these contemporary families cannot simply be described as egalitarian. Further, although the forms of emotion work and ``gender strategies,'' ``family myths,'' and ``accounts'' with which women partners of trans men engage resonate with those from women in (non-trans) heterosexual and lesbian couples, they are also distinct, highlighting tensions among personal agency, politics, and structural inequalities in family life.	1	Carla A.

Lee, Kristen, Paula Tufis & Duane Alwin. 2010. 'Separate Spheres or Increasing Equality? Changing Gender Beliefs in Postwar Japan.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:1 184-201.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	1	This research investigates change in gender beliefs in Japan during a period of economic hard times in the late 1990s. Using data from the International Social Survey Programme on the Japanese population from 1994 (n = 1,054) and 2002 (n = 872), we examined how cohort replacement and intracohort change contributed to changes in gender beliefs. We found important differences from the patterns of change reported for many Western countries, namely, a decoupling between societal trends in the female labor force participation rate and beliefs about gender. Such differences may be attributable to factors such as the high societal valuation of the housewife role compared to that in other postindustrial countries and sanctions against full-time employment for women in Japan.	3	Kristen Schultz Lee; Paula A.

Denney, Justin. 2010. 'Family and Household Formations and Suicide in the United States.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:1 202-213.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	2	Family support systems have been theoretically linked to suicide risk. But no research to date has investigated the effects of detailed living arrangements on individual risk of suicide. Using data on 825,462 adults from the National Health Interview Survey Linked Mortality File reveals that living in families with stronger sources of social support and integration decreases risk of suicide. These effects persist despite controls for important individual level characteristics. Risk of suicide decreases for persons in married as well as unmarried families when children are present and risk increases for persons living with unrelated adults. These results reveal the structural importance of family formation on the social integrative forces that contribute to an individual's risk of suicide.	1	Justin T. Denney
Hesmondhalgh, David & Sarah Baker. 2010. '`a Very Complicated Version of Freedom': Conditions and Experiences of Creative Labour in Three Cultural Industries.' Poetics. 38:1 4-20.	Poetics	2010	7	This article investigates the experiences and emotional responses of interviewees to their working conditions in three cultural industries (the television industry, the recording industry and the magazine industry). Via semi-structured interviews with a range of workers, it explores working conditions and experiences in the following areas: pay, working hours and unions; insecurity and uncertainty; socialising, networking and isolation. Our research suggests that experiences are at best highly ambivalent, across all three of the industries we studied. We found evidence of feelings of victimisation and anxiety. Building on previous research, especially that carried out on IT workers, we also discerned complicated responses on the part of workers to the freedom and autonomy characteristic of much cultural work. Pleasure and obligation become blurred in a challenging way. Expectations of sociability and networking in these industries were also the object of some ambivalence, and some workers reported feelings of isolation. These findings suggest that creative industries policy has paid insufficient attention to the experiences of creative workers.	2	David Hesmondhalgh; Sarah Baker
Mears, Ashley. 2010. 'Size Zero High-end Ethnic: Cultural Production and the Reproduction of Culture in Fashion Modeling.' Poetics. 38:1 21-46.	Poetics	2010	7	The fashion modeling industry has long been criticized for using excessively thin and exclusively Anglo-looking models in advertising and runway shows. How do fashion producers make decisions to hire models, and why is the fashion model aesthetic defined so narrowly? Based on participant observation and interviews with modeling agents and clients in New York and London, the current study explains how producers in the modeling industry weigh their decisions on two publicly polemical issues: slenderness and racial exclusion. As workers in cultural production, agents and clients face intense market uncertainty when selecting models. In the absence of objective standards, they rely on conventions, imitation, and stereotypes to guide their decisions. Producers hire fashion models to articulate market-specific versions of femininity. In the commercial market, they emphasize demographics, racial inclusion, sex appeal and attainable beauty; in the high-end editorial market, they seek distinction, sexual unavailability and rarefied beauty. As cultural producers, agents and clients ultimately reproduce culture by fashioning femininity along race and class lines.	1	Ashley Mears
Sanders, George. 2010. 'the Dismal Trade as Culture Industry.' Poetics. 38:1 47-68.	Poetics	2010	0	The American funeral industry has become increasingly corporatized and consumer-centric and, as a result, the production-side mechanisms involved in creating, marketing, and distributing its goods have changed. In this paper, I look at four mainstays of the funeral industry embalmed bodies, burial containers, burial grounds, and funeral events to examine how people and production processes shape those products. Doing so allows one to view the funeral industry's contributions as a culture industry that helps shape and gets shaped by broader economic and ideological forces. I describe some of the ongoing and emergent processes that allow for shifting roles of both funeral workers and consumers. By emphasizing the production of cultural objects, the symbolic systems that contribute to meanings around death, consumption, and remembrance are revealed. It is through these various products and processes that the industry contributes to cultural management by highlighting or concealing representations of the deceased, prescribing particular ritualistic behaviors, and distributing memorial artifacts as part of a broader material culture regarding the dead.	1	George Sanders
Blasius, Joerg & Andreas Muehlichen. 2010. 'Identifying Audience Segments Applying the ``social Space'' Approach.' Poetics. 38:1 69-89.	Poetics	2010	4	Lifestyle characteristics have been researched in the social sciences and other areas for more than 40 years now. Among the most prominent approaches belong AIO (Activities, Interests, and Opinions) and VALS (Values and Lifestyles). Based on a large number of questions, often more than 100, towards leisure activities, preferences and attitudes, either cluster analysis methods are used to derive distinct lifestyle segments or factor analysis methods are used to obtain latent axes that can be interpreted as lifestyle dimensions. A theory-rich alternative is Bourdieu's ``social space'' approach, which is also based on lifestyle characteristics. Bourdieu and his scholars usually applied multiple correspondence analysis for creating a so-called ``social space''. In this space, variables are visualized in a map, which can be read like a geographic map: similarities between indicators are reflected by short distances and dissimilarities by large distances. Since there are few constraints on the data only, this method is especially applicable to categorical data. Based on a survey sample (n = 872), we will use this approach to map the connections between lifestyle characteristics, preferred celebrities, preferred movies, socio-demographic characteristics and consumer goods. We will demonstrate that our approach can generate a very detailed audience segmentation, including expressive modes of television product consumption.	2	Joerg Blasius; Andreas Muehlichen
Roose, Henk & Daan Vandenhaute. 2010. 'Art World on Stage: Analyzing the Social Logic of Literary Realities and Aesthetic Dispositions in the Contemporary Flemish Theatre World.' Poetics. 38:1 90-108.	Poetics	2010	1	In Art Worlds (1982), Howard Becker presents a sociological account of how the production of art is a collective enterprise involving various people occupying different roles and positions. This article investigates to what extent various members of the contemporary theatre world in Flanders (Belgium) differ in their aesthetic dispositions and their familiarity with and preference for a wide range of playwrights, providing insight into the literary reality of these dramatists. Using a unique dataset that combines a sizeable sample of audience members with a random sample of drama teachers, students, directors, actors, and stagecraft and technical crew active both in the professional and the amateur field, we applied multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) to explore what latent dimensions the Flemish theatre world is structured along. We found that three axes constitute the field: a knowledge axis, an experiment axis, and a folk axis. The `Beckerian' positions are primarily structured along taste oppositions that can be traced to `Bour-dieusian' investments in types of cultural capital through educational level and tracking.	2	Henk Roose; Daan Vandenhaute
Yusuf, Farhat & Gordon Brooks. 2010. 'Demographics and Consumption Patterns in Urban China.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:1, SI 5-17.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	1	This study examines differences among urban Chinese consumers and their consumption patterns in three major cities-Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin-utilising data from a nationally representative sample survey conducted in 2005. Differences were found in these consumers' age distribution, education level, household composition, birth and death rates, income, expenditure patterns and consumer durable ownership rates. Beijing and Shanghai, the two most affluent cities in China, exhibited the highest consumer durable ownership rates and the highest cost of living. While previous research has frequently segmented China in terms of a rural versus urban dichotomy or by geographic region, this study suggests that the urban Chinese do not constitute a homogeneous market. Further, it is suggested that both geographic region and income, which varies between rural and urban settings, are sound bases for segmenting this important market.	2	Farhat Yusuf; Gordon Brooks

Population Research and Policy Review	2010	1	This case study illustrates how applied demographers operate in a politically charged context of competing interests-here, justifying the decision to locate a new public medical school in one medically underserved region rather than another. We show how to use demographic and other data to gauge the magnitude of future demand for physicians; formulate demographic assumptions about the future to serve decisionmakers' needs; and frame information to help improve decision making through objective analysis. We detail the steps in projecting future physicians per capita using a method based on the economic concept of physician demand rather than the social concept of need. Our method is computationally simple, intuitive, and easily understood by policymakers. Our case study offers applied demographers a practical approach to physician workforce planning and can be used as an instructional exercise for students, assigned to replicate these projections elsewhere and distill their implications.	2	Megan K.

Morrison, Peter & Thomas Bryan. 2010. 'Targeting Spatial Clusters of Elderly Consumers in the Usa.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:1, SI 33-46.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	1	For business demographers, a noteworthy aspect of national population aging is the course of its onset at local scales, such as neighborhoods and individual city blocks. Across the U. S., particular neighborhoods are evolving through aging in place into de facto retirement communities, populated by elderly residents who continue to live independently. An increasingly common manifestation of this development is the so-called naturally occurring retirement community (NORC)-a neighborhood where adults have stayed on and grown old while younger people have drifted away. NORCs materialize gradually over time where initial cohorts settle in close proximity and age in place, while subsequent younger cohorts move away. These settings offer novel opportunities for prolonging independent living in old age. They constitute distinctive readymade consumer markets as well, especially for businesses that rely on word of mouth. We present a general approach to spotting NORCs. We then consider such enclaves as potential target markets, both for community planners aiming to centralize service delivery to the elderly and for businesses offering types of services that can be bundled profitably for these residential concentrations of elderly.	2	Peter A.

We provide the documentation on the methods, data, and assumptions used to develop two sets of population projections for census tracts in Clark County, Nevada, and discuss specific factors needed to accomplish this task, including the need to bring expert judgment to bear on the task. Our experience suggests that the Hamilton-Perry Method is an important tool and we advise considering it for small forecasting needs in the private sector.	3	David A.

Clark, Robert & Linda Ghent. 2010. 'Strategic Hr Management With an Aging Workforce: Using Demographic Models to Determine Optimal Employment Policies.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:1, SI 65-80.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	2	A key component of the strategic plan for any company is the determination of the optimal number of workers needed to produce the desired level of output. Unless workers of different ages have the same skills and productivity, managers must also decide on the best age structure of their workforce and adopt compensation and employment policies to achieve these objectives. Employer responses to the shifts in the demand for their output impact the age distribution of the workforce while employment and compensation policies influence age specific hiring, retention, and retirement rates. This paper examines how demographic models can be used to project the future age structure of a labor force. In addition, we describe how compensation policies can be used to alter trends in the age distribution of employees. Thus, employers can develop strategic plans for achieving the desired labor force.	2	Robert L. Clark; Linda S. Ghent

Population Research and Policy Review	2010	1	Many faculty members consider using case studies but not all end up using them. We provide a brief review of what cases are intended to do and identify three ways in which they can be used. We then use an example to illustrate how we have used the case study method in teaching business demography. Among other benefits, we note that the case studies method not only encourages the acquisition of skills by students, but can be used to promote ``deep structure learning,'' an approach naturally accommodates other features associated with the case studies method-the development of critical thinking skills, the use of real world problems, the emphasis of concepts over mechanics, writing and presentation skills, active cooperative learning and the ``worthwhileness'' of a course. As noted by others, we understand the limitations of the case study method. However, given its strengths, we believe it has a place in the instructional toolbox for courses in business demography. The fact that courses we teach is a testament to our perceived efficacy of this tool.	2	David A. Swanson; Peter A. Morrison

These results support previous findings that link social capital with other forms of civic engagement.	2	Lisa A. Neilson; Pamela Paxton
Welch, Kelly & Allison Payne. 2010. 'Racial Threat and Punitive School Discipline.' Social Problems. 57:1 25-48.	Social Problems	2010	11	Tests of the racial threat hypothesis, linking the racial composition of place to various measures of social control, find that where there are greater percentages of blacks, more punitive criminal justice policies are implemented. Just as the criminal justice system continues to get tougher on crime despite stagnant crime rates, it is also clear that schools are becoming harsher toward student misbehavior and delinquency despite decreases in these school-based occurrences. However, only a very limited number of studies have been able to partially explain this trend of intensifying social control in schools. Using a national sample of 294 public schools, the present study is the first to test the racial threat hypothesis within schools to determine if tire racial composition of students predicts greater use of punitive controls, regardless of levels of misbehavior and delinquency. Results of multivariate analyses support the racial threat perspective, finding that schools with a larger percentage of black students are not only more likely to use punitive disciplinary responses, but also more likely to use extremely punitive discipline and to implement zero tolerance policies. They also use fewer mild disciplinary practices and restitutive techniques: In addition, racial threat is more influential when school delinquency and disorder are lower.	2	Kelly Welch; Allison Ann Payne
Duffy, Meghan, Amy Binder & John Skrentny. 2010. 'Elite Status and Social Change: Using Field Analysis to Explain Policy Formation and Implementation.' Social Problems. 57:1 49-73.	Social Problems	2010	5	Integrating an analysis of fields into studies of social change provides a better understanding of the outcomes achieved by challengers. We demonstrate the value of field analysis through a case study of a social change effort regarding urban land use. An organization led by wealthy and well-connected individuals pressed city government and a powerful for-profit developer to incorporate progressive social goals into a new urban development project. We show how the organization was able to achieve success in the policy formation field but faced significantly more obstacles when trying to enter another field (policy implementation), despite its elite status. Thus, using fields to study the case can bolster scholars' understanding of elite power and status, as well as help explain outcomes. The advantages enjoyed by elites can be field specific rather than universal, and so do not translate automatically into successful challenge results.	3	Meghan M. Duffy; Amy J. Binder; John D.

Best, Rachel. 2010. 'Situation or Social Problem: the Influence of Events on Media Coverage of Homelessness.' Social Problems. 57:1 74-91.	Social Problems	2010	2	Despite a strong interest in media coverage of social problems, sociologists have failed to examine when and why news outlets present issues as problems in need of public action within short time periods. Through content analysis of 475 newspaper articles and negative binomial regression, I show that coverage of homelessness varies in the extent to which it presents homelessness as a social problem. The fact that not all news coverage discusses social problems challenges the claim that social problems necessarily compete for attention in a zero-sum game. I also examine the effects of three types of events (events promoted to the media by their actors and high- and low-profile events not promoted by their actors) on newspapers' likelihood of describing homelessness as a social problem. While previous researchers predicted that events not promoted by their actors would lead to media coverage that challenged the status quo, I find that actor-promoted events are much more likely to do so: This finding highlights the importance of institutionalized action in calling attention to social problems.	1	Rachel Best
Saperstein, Aliya & Andrew Penner. 2010. 'the Race of a Criminal Record: How Incarceration Colors Racial Perceptions.' Social Problems. 57:1 92-113.	Social Problems	2010	11	In the United States, racial disparities in incarceration and their consequences are widely discussed and debated. Previous research suggests that perceptions of crime and the operations of the criminal justice system play an important role in shaping how Americans think about race. This study extends the conversation by exploring whether being incarcerated affects how individuals perceive their own race as well as how they are perceived by others, using unique longitudinal data from the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth. Results show that respondents who have been incarcerated are more likely to identify and be seen as black, and less likely to identify and be seen as white, regardless of how they were perceived or identified previously. This suggests that race is not a fixed characteristic of individuals but is flexible and continually negotiated in everyday interactions.	2	Aliya Saperstein; Andrew M. Penner
Dwyer, Rachel. 2010. 'Poverty, Prosperity, and Place: the Shape of Class Segregation in the Age of Extremes.' Social Problems. 57:1 114-137.	Social Problems	2010	10	Rising economic disparities in the United States at the end of the twentieth century make understanding the severity and determinants of residential segregation between the affluent and poor increasingly important. Existing studies are limited, however, by little attention to the spatial configuration of class segregation. Segregation occurs along multiple spatial dimensions-the affluent and poor may be split not only between different neighborhoods, but concentrated over more or less land, more or less centralized, and clustered near or far from other similar neighborhoods. Each dimension affects the amount of contact and shared resources between groups differently, and overlaps between them produce particularly severe social isolation. Theories conflict over the spatial form of class segregation, with the concentric zone model expecting the affluent to be clustered in large-lot developments on the metropolitan fringe and critics proposing alternative spatial forms in a more patchwork pattern. I use U.S. Census summary data for all metropolitan areas in 2000 to test competing theories of the patterns and determinants of the spatial form of affluent-poor segregation using cluster and regression analysis. l identify two dominant spatial forms of affluent-poor segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas in 2000, and find that racial diversity and segregation are key determinants of which spatial form characterizes a metropolitan area. The links between poverty, prosperity, and place were therefore crucially shaped by race as well as economic disparities in the age of extremes.	1	Rachel E. Dwyer

This article considers the implications of drawing a conceptual distinction between race and color for research on racial classifications in Latin America.	1	Tanya Golash-Boza

This essay discusses three subfields in Sociology in which the sociological study of immigrants has contributed to bring new light to long-standing questions: family, religion, and ethnic and racial studies. At the same time, it brings up areas - culture and arts, social movements and civic engagement, and citizenship, belonging and the state - in which immigration scholars in sociology could establish a more vibrant intellectual dialog with those subfields. Far from exhausting the discussion, these comments are intended to offer potential avenues for further research and discussion.	1	Cecilia Menjivar

Sociological Inquiry	2010	2	The Global Digital Divide (GDD) in Internet and related forms of information technologies has gained some press and scholarly attention in recent years. Although the contours and causes of Internet diffusion around the globe are now better understood, a number of questions and avenues remain unanswered or unexplored, particularly concerning the role of socio-demographic structures and even conflict processes on Internet diffusion. This study addresses the current state of the digital divide and sheds new light on the barriers that continue to inhibit developing nations' lag with the West in Internet connectivity. Focusing on a large sample of the world's developing nations, this project finds that although the GDD is narrowing, the gap is still large and that specific demographic properties (high fertility) and conflict processes threaten to keep many societies in the periphery of cyberspace. The authors also find that urban agglomerations work to amplify Internet demand over time and that maturing economies may no longer require democratization as a pathway to Internet development. Implications of these findings and future directions of research are briefly discussed.	2	Kristopher K. Robison; Edward M. Crenshaw
Drori, Gili. 2010. 'Globalization and Technology Divides: Bifurcation of Policy Between the ``digital Divide'' and the ``innovation Divide''.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:1 63-91.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	1	The global diffusion of digital technology, which occurred more rapidly than the global diffusion of any technology previously, has been mired by its uneven distribution across, and unequal effects on, societies worldwide. In addition, policy initiatives to close this global digital divide, which peaked with the two World Summit on Information Society conferences, still did not change the course of this differentiated globalization process. In this article, I attribute the cause of such stalling of policy on the issue of the global digital divide to the bifurcation of current international policy: attention is split between concern for the impeded access of the poor to this revolutionary technology, on the one hand, and the race to lead the world in creating the next ``hot'' technology, on the other. These two concerns, which have been given the pithy titles of the ``global digital divide'' and the ``global innovation divide,'' are leading to two separate policy tracks, targeting the world's laggards and leaders as separate entities and operating under separate logics. This separation is problematic because the issues of access to technology and ownership of rights to technology are intertwined. This article describes the two global technology divides and analyzes the policies that are currently charted to address them.	1	Gili S. Drori

Sociological Inquiry	2010	77	People who have grown up with digital media are often assumed to be universally savvy with information and communication technologies. Such assumptions are rarely grounded in empirical evidence, however. This article draws on unique data with information about a diverse group of young adults' Internet uses and skills to suggest that even when controlling for Internet access and experiences, people differ in their online abilities and activities. Additionally, findings suggest that Internet know-how is not randomly distributed among the population, rather, higher levels of parental education, being a male, and being white or Asian American are associated with higher levels of Web-use skill. These user characteristics are also related to the extent to which young adults engage in diverse types of online activities. Moreover, skill itself is positively associated with types of uses. Overall, these findings suggest that even when controlling for basic Internet access, among a group of young adults, socioeconomic status is an important predictor of how people are incorporating the Web into their everyday lives with those from more privileged backgrounds using it in more informed ways for a larger number of activities.	1	Eszter Hargittai
Farrell, Dan & James Petersen. 2010. 'the Growth of Internet Research Methods and the Reluctant Sociologist.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:1 114-125.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	5	Between 1999 and 2004 only one article appeared in the American Sociological Review, the American Journal of Sociology, or Social Forces using primary data collected with Web-based research techniques. Since then there have been only a handful of studies published in these core sociology journals drawing on Web-based surveys or other forms of Web-based data. The use of Internet-based data has become widespread in many academic fields, especially health research and education; Web-based techniques are becoming routine in the practice and study of politics; and online commercial and market research has become a billion dollar industry. At the same time, the utility of random digit dialing surveys has eroded considerably owing to declining contact rates, increased use of technologies to screen unwanted telephone calls, and the replacement of landline telephones with cell phones. There is increasing evidence that Internet research can produce representative data. Although Web-based surveys may overrepresent some populations, Internet usage in the general population is now well over 75 per cent and is especially strong among some hard to reach populations. Internet surveys have the potential to reduce measurement error, missing data, and respondent attrition. Sociologists must overcome their fear of participation in stigmatized Internet research and actively engage in the development of techniques and refinements that will increase the utility and validity of Internet-based data collection.	2	Dan Farrell; James C.

MacKendrick, Norah. 2010. 'Media Framing of Body Burdens: Precautionary Consumption and the Individualization of Risk.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:1 126-149.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	2	The accumulation of chemicals in human bodies and ecosystems represents a universal environmental and technological risk. As yet, little attention has been paid to media coverage of ``body burdens,'' the internal contaminant load carried by most organisms in the industrialized world. Using a sociology of risk perspective, this article analyzes the framing of chemical bioaccumulation in Canadian newspaper articles from 1986 to 2006. In later years, articles employ frames that reinforce an individualization of risk, where individuals are encouraged to avoid contaminants through ``precautionary consumption'' of green consumer goods. This shift in media discourse suggests that self-protection is emerging as a key frame in the discourse of risk, one that provides a sense of individual control over chemical exposure and shifts the focus away from collective forms of protection from universal risks.	1	Norah A.

Halpin, Brendan. 2010. 'Optimal Matching Analysis and Life-course Data: the Importance of Duration.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 38:3 365-388.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	7	The optimal matching (OM) algorithm is widely used for sequence analysis in sociology. It has a natural interpretation for discrete-time sequences but is also widely used for life-history data, which are continuous in time. Life-history data are arguably better dealt with in terms of episodes rather than as strings of time-unit observations, and in this article, the author examines whether the OM algorithm is unsuitable for such sequences. A modified version of the algorithm is proposed, weighting OM's elementary operations inversely with episode length. In the general case, the modified algorithm produces pairwise distances much lower than the standard algorithm, the more the sequences are composed of long spells in the same state. However, where all the sequences in a data set consist of few long spells, and there is low variability in the number of spells, the modified algorithm generates an overall pattern of distances that is not very different from standard OM.	1	Brendan Halpin
Lesnard, Laurent. 2010. 'Setting Cost in Optimal Matching to Uncover Contemporaneous Socio-temporal Patterns.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 38:3 389-419.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	13	This article addresses the question of the effects of cost setting on the kind of temporal patterns optimal matching (OM) can uncover when applied to social science data. It is argued that the balance between indel (insertion and deletion) and substitution costs determines what kind of socio-temporal pattern can be brought to light. Insertion and deletion operations favor identically coded states irrespective of their locations whereas substitutions focus on contemporaneous similarities. The lower the ratio of substitution to indel costs, the closer OM is to the Hamming distance where only substitutions are used. The higher this ratio, the closer OM is to the Levenshtein II distance, which amounts to finding the longest common subsequence. When the timing of sequences is crucial, substitutions should be favored over indels and their costs should be carefully fixed. Ideally, substitution costs should vary with time to better take into account the timing of the sequences studied. As indels warp time, hence the timing of sequences, it is suggested to use only substitution operations with time-dependent costs inversely proportional to transition frequencies whenever the timing of sequences is central. This OM variant, coined dynamic Hamming matching, is applied to the question of the scheduling of paid work where timing is critical (1985 and 1999 French time use surveys, N = 7,908) along with three classical OM variants (Hamming and Levenshtein I and II). As expected, the two Hamming dissimilarity measures fare better to identify patterns of workday schedules, as measured by entropy, than the two Levenshtein ones.	1	Laurent Lesnard

Sociological Methods \& Research. 38:3 420-462.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	21	In this article the authors draw attention to the most recent and promising developments of sequence analysis. Taking methodological developments in life course sociology as the starting point, the authors detail the complementary strength in sequence analysis in this field. They argue that recent advantages of sequence analysis were developed in response to criticism of the original work, particularly optimal matching analysis. This debate arose over the past two decades and culminated in the 2000 exchange in Sociological Methods \& Research. The debate triggered a ``second wave'' of sequence techniques that led to new technical implementations of old ideas in sequence analysis. The authors bring these new technical approaches together, demonstrate selected advances with synthetic example data, and show how they conceptually contribute to life course research. This article demonstrates that in less than a decade, the field has mademuch progress toward fulfilling the prediction that Andrew Abbott made in 2000, that ``anybody who believes that pattern search techniques are not going to be basic to social sciences over the next 25 years is going to be very much surprised'' (p. 75).	2	Silke Aisenbrey; Anette E.

Elzinga, Cees. 2010. 'Complexity of Categorical Time Series.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 38:3 463-481.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	6	Categorical time series, covering comparable time spans, are often quite different in a number of aspects: the number of distinct states, the number of transitions, and the distribution of durations over states. Each of these aspects contributes to an aggregate property of such series that is called complexity. Among sociologists and demographers, complexity is believed to systematically differ between groups as a result of social structure or social change. Such groups differ in, for example, age, gender, or status. The author proposes quantifications of complexity, based upon the number of distinct subsequences in combination with, in case of associated durations, the variance of these durations. A simple algorithm to compute these coefficients is provided and some of the statistical properties of the coefficients are investigated in an application to family formation histories of young American females.	1	Cees H.

Sociological Methods \& Research. 38:3 482-512.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	2	This article uses longitudinal data from the British Cohort Study to examine the early labor market trajectories-the careers-of more than 5,000 women aged 16 to 29 years. Conventional event history approaches focus on particular transitions, the return to work after childbirth, for example, whereas the authors treat female careers more holistically, using sequence methods and cluster analysis to arrive at a rich but readily interpretable description of the data. The authors' typology presents a fuller picture of the underlying heterogeneity of female career paths that may not be revealed by more conventional transition-focused methods. Furthermore, the authors contribute to the small but growing literature on sequence analysis of female labor force participation by using their typology to show how careers are related to family background and school experiences.	2	Michael Anyadike-Danes; Duncan McVicar
Joyce, Kelly & Meika Loe. 2010. 'a Sociological Approach to Ageing, Technology and Health.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:2 171-180.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	8	This special monograph issue builds on sociology of health and illness scholarship and expands the analytical lens to examine how old people, healthcare professionals, and technology designers create, use, and modify science and technology to negotiate and define health and illness. Far from passive consumers, elders are technogenarians, creatively utilising and adapting technological artefacts such as walking aids and medications to fit their needs. This publication adds theoretical and empirical depth to our understanding of the multiple and overlapping socio-historical contexts surrounding ageing bodies and ageing enterprises, including the biomedicalisation of ageing that includes the rise of anti-ageing or longevity medicine; and the rise of gerontechnology industries and professions -- fields that largely accept the ageing body as a given. This collection sociologically investigates how and where these two trends overlap and diverge in relation to a global context of ageing and ageism, and calls for further scholarship in this area. Combining science and technology studies and sociology of health and illness frameworks together provides an empirical basis from which to analyse technogenarians in action, as well as the stakeholders and institutions involved in the ageing, health, and technology matrix.	2	Kelly Joyce; Meika Loe
Mykytyn, Courtney. 2010. 'a History of the Future: the Emergence of Contemporary Anti-ageing Medicine.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:2 181-196.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	2	The emergence of anti-ageing medicine over the past 20 years has posed tremendous challenges for the understanding of ageing and the concomitant responsibilities of biomedicine. Though highly contentious and loosely organised at best, anti-ageing targets ageing for biomedical intervention. This article examines a history of anti-ageing in the United States from 1993 to 2008, outlining its evolution from a scientific `backwater' to a field with such promise that many within and outside the field believe efficacious therapies are an inevitability. In large part, the language of anti-ageing has shifted from predictions to expectations; it has become less a question of `if' and more a question of `when' and `how' this rhetorical shift is directly linked with increasing legitimacy constructed upon a complex web of factors including mounting practitioner involvement, research interest, media attention, and popular desire. In this article I briefly review this history alongside the strategic histories marshalled by the various proponents and opponents to support their claims of legitimacy. The history of anti-ageing medicine is one of an emerging scientific and clinical practice as well as a history of an idea that has very recently made its way out of science fiction and into science future.	1	Courtney Everts Mykytyn
Fishman, Jennifer, Richard Settersten & Michael Flatt. 2010. 'in the Vanguard of Biomedicine? the Curious and Contradictory Case of Anti-ageing Medicine.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:2 197-210.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	0	The rise of anti-ageing medicine is emblematic of the current conditions of American biomedicine. Through in-depth interviews with 31 anti-ageing practitioners, we examine how practitioners strive for-and justify-a model of care that runs counter to what they see as the `assembly line' insurance-managed industry of healthcare. Their motivation, however, is not merely a reaction to conventional medicine. It is derived from what they see as a set of core beliefs about the role of the physician, the nature of the physician-patient relationship, and the function of biomedicine. We analyse this ideology to underscore how anti-ageing medicine is built on a `technology of the self', a self in need of constant surveillance, intervention, and maintenance. The ultimate goal is to create an optimal self, not just a self free of illness. A fundamental irony is that, despite their self-presentation and the perception of the public, anti-ageing providers do not use practices that are especially `high-tech' or unconventional. Instead, the management of ageing bodies rests on providers' perceived knowledge of their patients, tailored treatments, and a collaborative pact between the provider and patient.	3	Jennifer R.

Marshall, Barbara. 2010. 'Science, Medicine and Virility Surveillance: `sexy Seniors' in the Pharmaceutical Imagination.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:2 211-224.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	10	While historically sex has been seen primarily as the prerogative of the young, more recently, the emphasis has been on the maintenance of active sexuality as a marker of successful ageing. A new cultural consensus appears to have emerged which not only emphasises the importance of continued sexual activity across the lifespan, but links sexual function with overall health and encourages increased self-surveillance of, and medical attention to, late-life sexuality. Drawing on historical accounts, clinical research, popular science reporting and health promotion literatures, I explore several key shifts in models of sexual ageing, culminating in the contemporary model of gender, sexuality and ageing that has made ageing populations a key market for biotechnologies aimed at enhancing sexual function. Two central concepts frame my analysis: `virility surveillance', where age-related changes in sexual function are taken as indicative of decline, and the `pharmaceutical imagination', where sexual lifecourses are reconstructed as drug effects revise standards of sexual function. After consideration of how narratives emerging from qualitative research with older adults challenge the narrow depiction of sexual functionality promoted by pharmaculture, conclusions call for continued critical inquiry into the biomedical construction of sex and age.	1	Barbara L.

Kaufman, Sharon. 2010. 'Time, Clinic Technologies, and the Making of Reflexive Longevity: the Cultural Work of Time Left in an Ageing Society.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:2 225-237.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	1	Developments in clinical intervention are having a profound impact on health and health behaviours in late life and on ideas about longevity and the appropriate time for death. The fact that the timing of death is even considered to be a controllable event is a relatively new cultural phenomenon. The activities that make up life extension, like other medical practices scrutinised by social scientists, constitute a site for the emergence of new forms of subjectivity. For older adults the clinical encounter forces a calculation about how much time left is wanted in relation to age. The twin dimensions of the transformation of time highlighted in this article - the control over the timing of death and the creation of time left- both contribute to and are a widespread effect of biomedicalisation in affluent sectors of society. Through three stories this paper begins to map the cultural work that the concept, time left, does, the socio-medical ways in which that notion is talked about, organised and calculated in the American clinic today. It asks, what kind of subject emerges when longevity, imbued with the technological, becomes a reflexive practice and an object of intervention and apparent choice?.	1	Sharon R. Kaufman

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	2	This study investigates women's attitudes about, and experiences of, aesthetic anti-ageing surgeries and technologies against the contextual backdrop of the growing commercialisation of medicine in the United States. Drawing from 44 intensive interviews with a spectrum of women between the ages of 47 and 76 who use, refuse, and are currently undecided about whether or not they will have or use aesthetic anti-ageing surgeries and technologies in the future, this study asks the following question: in what ways does the increasing availability, accessibility, advertising, and use of aesthetic anti-ageing surgeries and technologies interact with and inform women's perceptions and attitudes about growing older? Data analysis occurs in dialogue with the paradigms of successful ageing and agelessness and draws from, and contributes new readings of, contemporary cultural constructions of femininity.	1	Abigail T.

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	2	The paper discusses cosmetic surgery in the Finnish cultural context. It is based on interviews with 22 women and men who underwent surgical procedures, 12 plastic surgeons, and two plastic surgery consultants. The article shows that surgery consumers over 55 years old discuss cosmetic surgery as an investment in a better quality of life. Consumers use cosmetic surgery to resist ageist stereotypes of old people and as compensation for tough life experiences which are believed to cause premature ageing. Although aimed at combatting negative attitudes towards old people, such efforts reproduce an ageist ideology by concealing the very qualities (e.g. wrinkles) associated with ageing. Finally, consumers use cosmetic surgery to correct perceived Finnish physical pathologies, such as heavy foreheads, sagging eyelids, and `potato' noses, which make them seem less white, sadder, and older than they are. The traditional melancholic Finnish body is thus transformed via surgery to represent openness and positiveness - two qualities strongly associated with both youth and the Americanised ideal as it is touted in Finland. The article demonstrates that consumers use cosmetic surgery to transform both physical and emotional states and that cosmetic surgery must be understood as part of national and global cultural processes.	1	Taina Kinnunen

'Ageing in Place and Technologies of Place: the Lived Experience of People With Dementia in Changing Social, Physical and Technological Environments.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:2 272-287.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	10	This paper explores the varied meanings and lived experiences of older people with dementia, in relation to everyday technologies in public spaces outside the home, through re-analysis of qualitative data generated from research that focused on the use of technology in supporting people with dementia to carry on with their everyday outside activities. The data have been re-analysed to critically examine how people with memory loss manage being outside in both familiar and unfamiliar public environments. In doing so the authors explore how technologies mediate between the physical and social environment in which people with dementia live. This paper highlights the importance of a neglected space within dementia research, namely the outside public environment. Although the outside environment and activities that take place in that space, for some, are curtailed, for others the physical and social security of familiar environments enables them to carry on with everyday activities in this public realm. Outside space can be both therapeutic and frightening and this paper demonstrates that people with dementia can sometimes feel out of place in public space. It however also shows the variety of ways people with dementia use everyday technologies to manage `feeling out of place'.	4	Katherine Brittain; Lynne Corner; Louise Robinson; John Bond
Wigg, Johanna. 2010. 'Liberating the Wanderers: Using Technology to Unlock Doors for Those Living With Dementia.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:2 288-303.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	4	This paper focuses on surveillance technologies applied to wandering elders in dementia care facilities in the United States. Drawing on data collected in two long-term care settings, I examine how different forms of technology (e.g. locked doors and motion detectors) are used to monitor wanderers in the context of managing risk. In contrast to the locked facility that defined wandering as pathology, the care facility that defined wandering as purposeful and therapeutic improved wanderers' sense of wellbeing and agency. The comparison of the two environments challenges the medicalisation of wandering and suggests a need to redefine approaches to safe wandering that incorporate technologies that monitor but do not confine residents. I argue that surveillance technologies such as locked doors dehumanise and frighten individuals by halting their ability to exit. In contrast, surveillance technologies such as motion detectors may offer increased quality of life and health benefits by allowing individuals to wander safely in the company of a care provider. Efforts to allow individuals to wander safely challenge both the medicalisation of this behaviour as well as the tendency to emphasise its riskiness.	1	Johanna M. Wigg
Copelton, Denise. 2010. 'Output That Counts: Pedometers, Sociability and the Contested Terrain of Older Adult Fitness Walking.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:2 304-318.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	0	Based on five months of participant observation and interviews with members of a hospital-sponsored walking club, I explore the rejection of pedometer technology among older adult walkers. Health researchers praise pedometers as a useful tool for measuring walking activity, setting fitness goals, and charting progress towards goals. Older adult walkers, however, viewed pedometers and the monitoring they enable as anathema to walking group norms that stress sociability. I assess the differential construction of pedometers by fitness researchers, group leaders, and walkers themselves. While fitness researchers construct pedometer technology as a motivator for exercise adherence, walkers believed pedometers would create competition and hierarchy that might destroy group camaraderie. In contrast to biomedical models of health and wellness, which focus predominantly on exercise outputs like step counts, these findings suggest that sociability is an important component of health maintenance leisure activities for older adult walkers.	1	Denise A.

Loe, Meika. 2010. 'Doing It My Way: Old Women, Technology and Wellbeing.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:2 319-334.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	6	This article focuses on women in their nineties (nonagenarians) who are ageing in place - or ageing at home - in upstate New York. I analyse these old women's use of everyday technological tools to care for themselves and construct meaning. I argue that despite what we may expect, nonagenarian women can be and are technogenarians in their active and creative uses of everyday technologies. Old women utilise lifelong care work repertoires to identify, adjust, use and reject old and new technologies for their own everyday mobility, communication, nourishment, and physiological health. Perhaps most importantly techno-savvy elders can maintain and achieve health and wellbeing, associated here with bodily comfort, social networks, self-efficacy and intellectual life, in and beyond their homes. In these ways, nonagenarians can teach us how household technologies can be health and ageing technologies; instruments of continuity and control; or just the opposite.	1	Meika Loe
Neven, Louis. 2010. '`but Obviously Not for Me': Robots, Laboratories and the Defiant Identity of Elder Test Users.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:2 335-347.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	6	This article focuses on participants and researchers who actively tested a prototype - a robot intended to enhance the health of elders. Specifically, this article analyses interactions between robots, elder test users, and robot designers to examine how images of elder users, definitions of health, and ideas about ageing shape the development of technology. The designers imagined the prospective user as a person who would both need and want a health robot. In contrast, test users drew upon stereotypes of old people and imagined the prospective user as a lonely person in need of care and company. To resist this stereotype, they presented themselves as cognitively and physically healthy, independent, and helpful. This image of the helpful test user allowed participants to simultaneously enjoy the robot and position themselves as not old or in need of care. The participants' views, however, did not influence the designers' overall view of elder users, and were not incorporated into their design practices. Recognising and taking into account test users' views on elder technology users - specifically their understanding and rejection of negative stereotypes of old people - could help prevent resistance to (and thus the non-use of) health technologies by elders.	1	Louis Neven
Kmec, Julie & Elizabeth Gorman. 2010. 'Gender and Discretionary Work Effort: Evidence From the United States and Britain.' Work and Occupations. 37:1 3-36.	Work and Occupations	2010	7	Do men and women differ in the extent to which they work beyond the level required by their jobs? Does this gender difference vary across national contexts? The authors answer these questions using survey data from the United States and Britain. Multivariate ordered logistic regression models reveal no gender difference in self-reported discretionary effort in the United States, but greater discretionary effort among women in Britain, net of individual, family, and workplace characteristics. The authors attribute these findings to a greater divergence of women's and men's labor force participation and careers, historically weaker regulation of workplace equality, and a sharper differentiation of gender roles in Britain than in the United States. They conclude by discussing the relevance of national context for shaping gender differences in work orientations and behaviors.	2	Julie A. Kmec; Elizabeth H. Gorman

Dickerson, Niki, Lisa Schur, Douglas Kruse & Joseph Blasi. 2010. 'Worksite Segregation and Performance-related Attitudes.' Work and Occupations. 37:1 45-72.	Work and Occupations	2010	7	This article explores the effects of structural inequality on organizational outcomes by examining the relationship between worksite segregation and performance-related attitudes by gender, race, and ethnicity. We use a new data set based on detailed surveys of 21,000 U. S. employees among 207 worksites in 14 companies gathered between 2001 and 2006. To measure workplace segregation, the study used the Duncan dissimilarity index and composition measures in a multilevel model, estimating their relationship to performance-related attitudes (company loyalty, willingness to work hard, perceived company fairness, and turnover intention) among Whites, Blacks, Hispanics, and Asians, separately for men and women within each of these groups. The key finding is that worksite segregation is linked to worse performance-related attitudes for Black, Hispanic, and Asian males, but is generally not linked to such attitudes for the female groups. These results illustrate the effects that segregation can have on organizations and suggest directions for further research that explores the mechanisms connecting diversity to performance-related outcomes.	4	Niki Dickerson; Lisa Schur; Douglas Kruse; Joseph Blasi

Sherman, Rachel. 2010. '``time Is Our Commodity'': Gender and the Struggle for Occupational Legitimacy Among Personal Concierges.' Work and Occupations. 37:1 81-114.	Work and Occupations	2010	9	The emergence of personal concierge and errand services in the past decade offers a rare opportunity to look at a fledgling occupation with uncertain prospects and in particular to examine its rhetorical struggles for legitimacy. Providers of these services are attempting to commodify household and personal tasks largely associated with women's labor. Based on interviews and participant observation, this article demonstrates that this association of concierge work with women's work impedes its symbolic and monetary valuation in the market. In response, concierges primarily use gender-neutral frames to legitimate their product and cast themselves as professionals. This analysis illuminates multiple dimensions of legitimacy-seeking and documents the continued influence of gender on rhetorics of work and value in the market.	1	Rachel Sherman
Grannis, Rick. 2010. 'Six Degrees of ``who Cares?''.' American Journal of Sociology. 115:4 991-1017.	American Journal of Sociology	2010	1	The concept that we live in small world networks connected by short paths has proved fascinating. These networks, however, do not typically emerge as linear responses to individual-level changes; rather, subtle changes in relations produce extraordinarily different macrolevel outcomes. Similarly, nuances in how we conceptualize, define, and measure relations can lead to widely different network characterizations. The author demonstrates this variability using a spectrum of interaction types and argue that the dependence of results on subtleties in definition or measurement makes theoretical interpretation difficult. He offers an index to calculate how much inaccuracy or imprecision relational definitions or data-gathering techniques can tolerate before results yield utterly different interpretations.	1	Rick Grannis
Beckfield, Jason. 2010. 'the Social Structure of the World Polity.' American Journal of Sociology. 115:4 1018-1068.	American Journal of Sociology	2010	21	World polity research argues that modern states are shaped by embeddedness in a network of international organizations, and yet the structure of that network is rarely examined. This is surprising, given that world polity theory implies that the world polity should be an increasingly dense, even, flat field of association. This article describes the social structure of the world polity, using network analysis of the complete population of intergovernmental organizations as it has evolved since 1820. Analysis of the world polity's structure reveals growing fragmentation, driven by exclusive rather than universalist intergovernmental organizations. The world polity has thus grown less cohesive, more fragmented, more heterogeneous, and less ``small worldly'' in its structure. This structure reflects a recent rise in the regionalization of the world polity.	1	Jason Beckfield

American Journal of Sociology	2010	22	Analyses of neighborhood racial composition in 1980-2000 demonstrate that in multiethnic metropolitan regions there is an emerging pathway of change that leads to relatively stable integration These are ``global neighborhoods'' where Hispanics and Asians are the pioneer integrators of previously all-white zones, later followed by blacks. However, region-wide segregation is maintained at high levels by whites' avoidance of all-minority areas and by their continued exodus (albeit at reduced levels) from mixed settings. Globalization of neighborhoods adds a positive new element of diversity that alters but does not erase the traditional dynamic of minority invasion succession.	2	John R. Logan; Charles Zhang

Results indicate that profound racial and ethnic differences in proximity to industrial pollution persist when differences in individual education, household income, and other microlevel characteristics are controlled. Examination of underlying migration patterns further reveals that black and Latino householders move into neighborhoods with significantly higher hazard levels than do comparable whites and that racial differences in proximity to neighborhood pollution are maintained more by these disparate mobility destinations than by differential effects of pollution on the decision to move.	2	Kyle Crowder; Liam Downey

American Journal of Sociology	2010	18	Entrepreneurial groups face a twinned challenge: recognizing and implementing new ideas. We argue that entrepreneurship is less about importing ideas than about generating new knowledge by recombining resources. In contrast to the brokerage-plus-closure perspective, we address the overlapping of cohesive group structures. In analyzing the network processes of intercohesion, we identify a distinctive network topology: the structural fold. Actors at the structural fold are multiple insiders, facilitating familiar access to diverse resources. Our data set records personnel ties among the largest 1,696 Hungarian enterprises from 1987 to 2001. First, we test whether structural folding contributes to group performance. Second, because entrepreneurship is a process of generative disruption, we test the contribution of structural folds to group instability. Third, we move from dynamic methods to historical network analysis and demonstrate that coherence is a property of interwoven lineages of cohesion, built up through repeated separation and reunification.	2	Balazs Vedres; David Stark

Although available resources and favorable contexts matter, the core findings show that associations with more committed activists, that build organizational capacity, that carry out strong programmatic activity, and whose leaders work independently, generate greater effectiveness across outcomes.	5	Kenneth T.

Banks, James, Alastair Muriel & James Smith. 2010. 'Disease Prevalence, Disease Incidence, and Mortality in the United States and in England.' Demography. 47:S S211-S231.	Demography	2010	7	We find that both disease incidence and disease prevalence are higher among Americans in age groups 55-64 and 70-80, indicating that Americans suffer from higher past cumulative disease risk and experience higher immediate risk of new disease onset compared with the English. In contrast, age-specific mortality rates are similar in the two countries, with an even higher risk among the English after age 65. We also examine reasons for the large financial gradients in mortality in the two countries. Among 55- to 64-year-olds, we estimate similar health gradients in income and wealth in both countries, but for 70- to 80-year-olds, we find no income gradient in the United Kingdom. Standard behavioral risk factors (work, marriage, obesity, exercise, and smoking) almost fully explain income gradients among those aged 55-64 in both countries and a significant part among Americans 70-80 years old. The most likely explanation of the absence of an English income gradient relates to the English income benefit system: below the median, retirement benefits are largely flat and independent of past income, and hence past health, during the working years. Finally, we report evidence using a long panel of American respondents that their subsequent mortality is not related to large changes in wealth experienced during the prior 10-year period.	3	James Banks; Alastair Muriel; James P.

Case, Anne & Christina Paxson. 2010. 'Causes and Consequences of Early-life Health.' Demography. 47:S S65-S85.	Demography	2010	17	We examine the consequences of child health for economic and health outcomes in adulthood, using height us a marker of childhood health. After reviewing previous evidence, we present a conceptual framework that highlights data limitations and methodological problems that complicate the study of this topic. We then present estimates of the associations between height and a range of outcomes including schooling, employment, earnings, health, and cognitive ability measured in five data sets from early to late adulthood. These results indicate that, on average, taller individuals attain higher levels of education. Height is also positively associated with better economic, health, and cognitive outcomes. These associations are only partially explained by the higher average educational attainment of taller individuals. We then use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Children and young Adults survey to document the associations between health, cognitive development, and growth in childhood. Even among children with the same mother, taller siblings score better on cognitive tests and progress through school more quickly. Part of the differences found between siblings arises from differences in their birth weights and lengths attributable to mother's behaviors while pregnant. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that childhood health influences health and economic status throughout adulthood.	2	Anne Case; Christina Paxson

Demography	2010	4	The incorporation of biological information in large population surveys has expanded demographic analysis to clarify the meaning of observed trends and differences in population health and mortality. Levels of measured biological risk in the population were reduced in recent years largely because of the expanded use of prescription drugs. The increased use of antihypertensives and, to a lesser extent, lipid-lowering drugs was a likely cause of significant mortality reduction. Blacks and persons with lower educational attainment experience higher levels of biological risk factors, more diseases, and more frailty; these differences are the sources of higher mortality for these groups. Hispanics are less likely to have a higher prevalence of risk factors and diseases than the non-Hispanic population, providing further understanding of the ``Hispanic paradox.'' Almost every examined indicator of biological risk, disease, and frailty is related to higher mortality, indicating how incorporation of this information provides a fuller understanding of the morbidity process.	3	Eileen Crimmins; Jung Ki Kim; Sarinnapha Vasunilashorn

Demography	2010	5	We review recent developments in longitudinal studies of aging, focusing on the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study (WLS) and the Health and Retirement Study (FIRS). Both studies are part of a trend toward biosocial surveys in which biological measurement is joined with traditional survey techniques, and a related trend toward greater harmonization across studies. Both studies have collected DNA samples and are working toward genotyping that would allow broadly based association studies. Increased attention to psychological measurement of personality and of cognitive ability using adaptive testing structures has also been shared across the studies. The HRS has expanded its economic measurement to longitudinal studies of consumption and to broader-based measurement of pension and Social Security wealth. It has added biomarkers of cardiovascular risk. The WLS has developed an integrated approach to the study of death and bereavement and an innovative use of high school yearbook photographs to capture information about health in early life of its participants.	2	Robert M.

Kapteyn, Arike. 2010. 'What Can We Learn From (and About) Global Aging?.' Demography. 47:S S191-S209.	Demography	2010	6	Although aging is a global phenomenon, there are large differences across countries in both the speed of aging and the current age composition. Furthermore, countries adopt vastly different policies. This creates a natural laboratory that scientists can use to understand how policies affect outcomes. I discuss uncle,. what circumstances data from different countries can be used for inference about policy effects. Although comparable health and retirement data are currently being collected in some 25 countries, the use of such data requires careful modeling of differences in institutions and in response styles across countries.	1	Arike Kapteyn
Lee, Ronald & Andrew Mason. 2010. 'Some Macroeconomic Aspects of Global Population Aging.' Demography. 47:S S151-S172.	Demography	2010	9	Across the demographic transition, declining mortality followed by declining fertility produces decades of rising support ratios as child dependency falls. These improving support ratios raise per capita consumption, other things equal, but eventually deteriorate as the population ages. Population aging and the forces leading to it can produce not only frightening declines in support ratios but also very substantial increases in productivity and per capita income by raising investment in physical and human capital. Longer life, lower fertility and population aging all raise the demand for wealth needed to provide for old-age consumption. This leads to increased capital per worker even as aggregate saving rates fall. However, capital per worker may not rise if the increased demand for wealth is satisfied by increased familial or public pension transfers to the elderly. Thus, institutions and policies matter for the consequences of population aging. The accumulation of human capital also varies across the transition. Lower fertility and mortality are associated with higher human capital investment per child, also raising labor productivity. Together, the positive changes due to human and physical capital accumulation will likely outweigh the problems of declining support ratios. We draw on estimates and analyses from the National Transfer Accounts project to illustrate and quantify these points.	2	Ronald Lee; Andrew Mason

Demography	2010	15	The decline in late-life disability prevalence in the United States was one of the most important developments in the well-being of older Amen cans in the 1980s and 1990s, but there is no guarantee that it will continue into the future. We review the past literature on trends in disability and other health indicators and then estimate the most recent trends in biomarkers and limitations for both the population aged 65 and older and those aged 40 to 64, the future elderly. We then investigate the extent to which trends in education, smoking, and obesity can account for recent trends in limitations and discuss how these three factors might influence future prospects for late-life health. We find that improvements in the health of the older population generally have continued into the first decade of the twenty-first centuty. The recent increase in the proportion of the younger population needing help with activities of daily living is concerning, as is the doubling of obesity in the last few decades. However, the increase in obesity has recently paused, and favorable trends in education and smoking are encouraging.	3	Linda G. Martin; Robert F. Schoeni; Patricia M. Andreski
Perlroth, Daniella, Dana Goldman & Alan Garber. 2010. 'the Potential Impact of Comparative Effectiveness Research on Us Health Care Expenditures.' Demography. 47:S S173-S190.	Demography	2010	11	Comparative effectiveness research (CER) has the potential to slow health care spending growth by focusing resources on health interventions that provide the most value. In this article, we discuss issues surrounding CER and its implementation and apply these methods to a salient clinical example: treatment of prostate cancer Physicians have several options for treating patients recently diagnosed with localized disease, including removal of the prostate (radical prostatectomy), treatment with radioactive seeds (brachytherapy), radiation therapy (IMRT), or-if none of these are pursued-active surveillance. Using a commercial health insurance claims database and after adjustment for comorbid conditions, we estimate that the additional cost of treatment with radical prostatectomy is \$7,300, while other alternatives are more expensive-\$19,000 for brachytherapy and \$46,900 for IMRT. However, a review of the clinical literature uncovers no evidence that justifies the use of these more expensive approaches. These results imply that if patient management strategies were shifted to those supported by CER-based criteria, an estimated \$1.7 to \$3.0 billion (2009 present value) could be saved each year	3	Daniella J.

Waite, Linda & Aniruddha Das. 2010. 'Families, Social Life, and Well-being at Older Ages.' Demography. 47:S S87-S109.	Demography	2010	5	As people age, many aspects of their lives tend to change, including the constellation of people with whom they are connected, their social context, their families, and their health-changes that are often interrelated. Wave I of the National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP) has yielded rich information on intimate ties, especially dyads and families, and on social connections generally. Combined with extensive biological and other health measures, NSHAP enables researchers to address key questions on health and aging. We begin with recent findings on intimate dyads, then move to social participation, and finally to elder mistreatment. Among dyads, we find that whereas sexual activity drops sharply with age for both women and men, gender differences in partner loss as well as psychosocial and normative pressures constrain women's sex more than men's. However, surviving partnerships tend to be emotionally and physically satisfying and are marked by relatively frequent sex. In contrast to sex, nonsexual intimacy is highly prevalent at older ages, especially among women. Older adults are also socially resilient-adapting to the loss of social ties by increasing involvement with community and kin networks. Despite these social assets, older adults remain vulnerable to mistreatment. Overall, these findings yield a mixed picture of gender-differentiated vulnerabilities balanced by proactive adaptation and maintenance of social and dyadic assets.	2	Linda Waite; Aniruddha Das
Wise, David. 2010. 'Facilitating Longer Working Lives: International Evidence on Why and How.' Demography. 47:S S131-S149.	Demography	2010	1	The article advances the view that social and economic choices in societies can reasonably adjust as the age structure of the population changes; in particular some of the bounty of longer lives can reasonably be allocated to prolonging the labor force participation of older workers. Data on reductions in mortality and, in some countries, declines in disability are presented in ways that help to clarify that prolonged working lives may be a natural concomitant of living longer. The article reviews the problems inherent in the combination of living longer and reducing labor force participation at older ages. It discusses two ways to facilitate longer working lives: (1) eliminating penalties on work at older ages-inherent in the provisions of the social security programs in many countries-that induce older persons to leave the labor force at younger ages; and (2) correcting a false rationale-the ``boxed economy'' view of the labor market-that is often used to support retention of the provisions that induce older persons to leave the labor force.	1	David A.

How do societies shape individuals? This article develops a framework for studying the connections between micro and macro phenomena. The framework builds on two ingredients widely used in social sciencepopulation and variable. Starting with the simplest case of one population and one variable, additional variables and additional populations are systematically introduced. This approach enables simple and natural introduction and exposition of such operations as pooling, matching, regression, hierarchical and multilevel modeling, calculating summary measures, finding the distribution of a function of random variables, and choosing between two or more distributions. To illustrate the procedures we draw on problems from a variety of topical domains in social science, including an extended illustration focused on residential racial segregation. Three useful features of the framework are: First, similarities in the mathematical structure underlying distinct substantive questions, spanning different levels of aggregation and different substantive domains, become apparent. Second, links between distinct methodological procedures and operations become apparent. Third, the framework has a potential for growth, as new models and operations become incorporated into the framework.	1	Guillermina Jasso
Fioretti, Guido. 2010. 'a Model of Vacancy Chains as a Mechanism for Resource Allocation.' Journal of Mathematical Sociology. 34:1 52-75.	Journal of Mathematical Sociology	2010	1	Vacancy chains can be tracked in any context where the availability of a desirable resource triggers a cascade of occupations through which the scarce resource flows through different owners. However, under certain conditions, vacancy chains, rather than markets or other forms of competition, determine the allocation of the resource. This article develops a formal and computational model of vacancy chains as a mechanism for resource allocation in order to find out their properties with respect to organizational forms. We find that hierarchies with few middle managers are particularly prone to make use of vacancy chains in order to allocate resources that originate at the top, such as employment positions. In fact, vacancy chains often disappear when information is widely available, because information is likely to attract applicants who engage in a competition. Thus, the many middle managers of a thick organization may compete for a resource that originates at the top. On the contrary, organizations that are thick at the bottom and at the top, but thin in the middle, are most likely to regulate resource allocation by means of vacancy chains.	1	Guido Fioretti
Bothner, Matthew, Richard Haynes, Wonjae Lee & Edward Smith. 2010. 'When Do Matthew Effects Occur?.' Journal of Mathematical Sociology. 34:2 80-114.	Journal of Mathematical Sociology	2010	8	What are the boundary conditions of the Matthew Effect? In other words, under what circumstances do initial status differences result in highly skewed reward distributions over the long run, and when, conversely, is the accumulation of status-based advantages constrained? Using a formal model, we investigate the fates of actors in a contest who start off as status-equivalents, produce at different levels of quality, and thus come to occupy distinct locations in a status ordering. We build from a set of equations in which failing to observe cumulative advantage seems implausible and then demonstrate that, despite initial conditions designed to lead inevitably to status monopolization, circumstances still exist that rein in the Matthew Effect. Our results highlight the importance of a single factor governing whether the Matthew Effect operates freely or is circumscribed. This factor is the degree to which status diffuses through social relations. When actors' status levels are strongly influenced by the status levels of those dispensing recognition to them, then eventually the top-ranked actor is nearly matched in status by the lower-ranked actor she endorses. In contrast, when actors' status levels are unaffected by the status levels of those giving them recognition, the top-ranked actor amasses virtually all status available in the system. Our primary contribution is the intuition that elites may unwittingly and paradoxically destroy their cumulative advantage beneath the weight of their endorsements of others. Consequently, we find that the Matthew Effect is curtailed by a process that, at least in some social settings, is a property of status itselfits propensity to diffuse through social relations. Implications for future research are discussed.	4	Matthew S. Bothner; Richard Haynes; Wonjae Lee; Edward Bishop Smith

Then, we concentrate on trees and prove that in trees with maximum S(G) the eigenvector ordering is coherent with the degree ordering; that is, degree central vertices are also eigenvector central. This confirms results given in Bonacich (2007). Further, we show that these trees have minimum diameter and maximum spectral radius in the set of trees with a given degree sequence. A simple application to a company organizational network is provided.	3	Rosanna Grassi; Silvana Stefani; Anna Torriero

Journal of Mathematical Sociology	2010	1	Algebraic methods to establish the identification of structural equation models remain a viable option. However, sometimes it is unclear whether the algebraic solution establishes identification. One example is when there is more than one way to solve for the parameter, but one way leads to a single value and a second way leads to a function with more than one value. This article proves that one explicit and unique solution is sufficient for model identification even when other explicit solutions permit more than one solution. The results are illustrated with an example. The results are useful to attempts to use algebraic means to address model identification.	2	Kenneth A. Bollen; Shawn Bauldry
Friedkin, Noah. 2010. 'a Multilevel Event History Model of Social Diffusion: Medical Innovation Revisited.' Journal of Mathematical Sociology. 34:2 146-155.	Journal of Mathematical Sociology	2010	0	This article presents a multilevel event history model of social diffusion and applies it to Coleman, Katz, and Menzel's (1966) data on the adoption of tetracycline by physicians. The simplest form of a multilevel model allows a random intercept. In the present application of this simple model to the Medical Innovation data, structured for an event history analysis, the physicians are nested in city and time. Random intercepts capture effects of contextual conditions that are shared by event history cases with the same city-time status. The intercepts also reflect any baseline internal contagion effects, that is, the proportion of physicians in the city-time network who have adopted the drug at time t-1. Here, I show that Van den Bulte and Lilien's (2001) finding of an important contextual effect of drug firms' marketing effort is misleading. I also show that the social network in which physicians are situated significantly contributes to their adoptions, controlling for baseline internal contagion effects and individual-level characteristics of physicians, which have been emphasized in investigations of these data.	1	Noah E.

For the first model, all particles are identical, but one initially knows the rumor. The limiting distribution is the convolution of two double exponential distributions. For the second model, there are two kinds of individuals: spreaders, who can spread the rumor, and ordinary individuals, who can only learn the rumor. Here, the limiting distribution is simply a double exponential distribution.	2	Stanislav Molchanov; Joseph M. Whitmeyer

We illustrate the deployment of this language to the theory of legitimation proposed by Hannan, Polos, and Carroll (2007).

This can help in the theoretical interpretation of such models.

The model generates seven predictions concerning these relationships and how they differ for men and women. For example, it predicts that background status will have a greater effect on personal occupational status for men than for women. We test these predictions empirically and find them mostly supported. This study shows, therefore, the promise of both formal theory and evolutionary reasoning for understanding these fundamental human social phenomena.	2	Rosemary L. Hopcroft; Joseph M. Whitmeyer

The SEM is applied to the dynamic state space model and compared with the Kalman filter (KF) approach. The likelihood of both methods are shown to be equivalent, but for long time series numerical problems occur in the SEM approach, which are traced to the inversion of the latent state covariance matrix. Both approaches are compared on several aspects. The SEM approach is now open for idiographic (N=1) analysis and estimation of panel data with correlated units.	1	Hermann Singer

Additionally, a fixed seating arrangement was considered as a second element of academy infrastructure capable of impacting racial integration. We examined the consequences of these academy components over time with regard to race by combining ethnographic accounts With social network data collected throughout the academy and using a variety of network analytic tools. These consequences with regard to race were examined as a part of social network evolution. The academy's social arrangements did accelerate the creation of social knowledge of recruits about each other and the formation of friendship ties both within and between races. However. our results point to cleat limitations to such infrastructural engineering and have implications for both recruitment to police academies and dealing with race. They shed light also oil processes of homophily and group composition over time and have implications for Studying social networks.	2	Norman Conti; Patrick Doreian
Snijders, Tom, Gerhard Bunt & Christian Steglich. 2010. 'Introduction to Stochastic Actor-based Models for Network Dynamics.' Social Networks. 32:1, SI 44-60.	Social Networks	2010	146	Stochastic actor-based models are models for network dynamics that can represent a wide variety of influences on network change, and allow to estimate parameters expressing such influences, and test corresponding hypotheses. The nodes in the network represent social actors, and the collection of ties represents a social relation. The assumptions posit that the network evolves as a stochastic process `driven by the actors', i.e., the model lends itself especially for representing theories about how actors change their outgoing ties. The probabilities of tie changes are in part endogenously determined, i.e., as a function of the current network structure itself, and in part exogenously, as a function of characteristics of the nodes ('actor covariates') and of characteristics of pairs of nodes ('dyadic covariates'). In an extended form, stochastic actor-based models can be used to analyze longitudinal data on social networks jointly with changing attributes of the actors: dynamics of networks and behavior. This paper gives an introduction to stochastic actor-based models for dynamics of directed networks, using only a minimum of mathematics. The focus is on understanding the basic principles of the model, understanding the results, and on sensible rules for Model selection. Crown Copyright	3	Tom A. Snijders; Gerhard G. Bunt; Christian E.

Social Networks	2010	15	The goal of this research was to investigate the origins of social networks by examining the form at ion of children's peer relationships in 11 preschool classes throughout the school year. We investigated whether several fundamental processes of relationship formation were evident at this age, including reciprocity, popularity, and triadic closure effects. We expected these mechanisms to change in importance over time as the network crystallizes, allowing more complex Structures to evolve from simpler ones in a process we refer to as structural cascading. We analyzed intensive longitudinal observational data of children's interactions Using the SIENA actor-based model. We found evidence that reciprocity, popularity, and triadic closure all shaped the formation of preschool children's networks. The influence of reciprocity remained consistent, whereas popularity and triadic closure became increasingly important over the course of the school year. Interactions between age and endogenous network effects were non-significant, suggesting that these network formation processes were not moderated by age in this sample of young children. We discuss the implications of our longitudinal network approach and findings for the study of early network developmental processes.	5	David R. Schaefer; John M. Light; Richard A. Fabes; Laura D.

Social Networks	2010	13	Most research on similarity in friendship networks focuses oil clearly visible individual attributes (i.e. attitudes and behaviors) in contexts where choices whom to befriend are relatively unconstrained. These studies often reveal that social selection rather than social influence is the dominant cause of similarity among friends. We argue that in a setting where social collaboration is crucial and friendship choices are more constrained, influence might be the main reason for similarity found among friends. In addition, we examined whether social categorization and peer control amplifies the social influence process among friends. Using a stochastic actor-based model for network dynamics, we analyzed a three-wave dataset of first year Royal Netherlands Naval College officer students oil friendship formation and military discipline. The data Supports our first hypothesis that students adjust their own military discipline to that of their friends. Contrary to our expectations, we did not find Support for the idea that individuals adjust their discipline more to friends who are of the same military specialty, and neither more to friends who exert peer control. We elaborate oil these findings in the discussion.	4	Maurits Klepper; Ed Sleebos; Gerhard Bunt; Filip Agneessens

Social Networks	2010	14	This paper discusses and illustrates various approaches for the longitudinal analysis of personal networks (multilevel analysis, regression analysis, and SIENA). We combined the different types of analyses in a study of the changing personal networks of immigrants. Data were obtained from 25 Argentineans in Spain, who were interviewed twice in a 2-year interval. Qualitative interviews were used to estimate the amount of measurement error and to isolate important predictors. Quantitative analyses showed that the persistence of ties was explained by tie strength, network density, and alters' Country of origin and residence. Furthermore, transitivity appeared to be an important tendency, both for acquiring new contacts and for the relationships among alters. At the network level, immigrants' networks were remarkably stable in composition and structure despite the high turnover. Clustered graphs have been used to illustrate the results. The results are discussed in light of adaptation to the host society.	6	Miranda J. Lubbers; Jose Luis; Juergen Lerner; Ulrik Brandes; Javier Avila; Christopher McCarty
Sherkat, Darren. 2010. 'Religion and Verbal Ability.' Social Science Research. 39:1 2-13.	Social Science Research	2010	9	Religion has a powerful influence on learning and development, and this provides an important cultural foundation for stratification processes. Findings from prior studies of the connection between religion and educational attainment are mixed, but most studies point to negative effects of sectarian Protestant affiliation and fundamentalist beliefs in the inerrancy of sacred texts on educational attainment, aspirations, occupational attainment, and wealth. Verbal ability provides an important potential mechanism through with conservative religion anchors stratification outcomes. I examine the impact of religious affiliation, religious participation, and beliefs in the inerrancy of the Bible on verbal ability. Using data from the 1984-2006 General Social Surveys, I find that both inerrantist beliefs and sectarian affiliations have substantial negative effects on verbal ability. Religious participation has a modest positive effect on verbal ability, but its influence is mostly confined to sectarian Protestants and biblical inerrantists. Importantly, the positive effect of age on verbal ability is substantially weaker among sectarians and biblical inerrantists, suggesting that their closed social networks hinder learning throughout the lifecourse.	1	Darren E.

Koehler, Gretchen & John Skvoretz. 2010. 'Residential Segregation in University Housing: the Mathematics of Preferences.' Social Science Research. 39:1 14-24.	Social Science Research	2010	2	Preferences for the racial neighborhood composition differ significantly between blacks and whites. Since [Schelling, Thomas. C. 1969. Models of Segregation. Memorandum RM-6014-RC. The RAND Corporation, Santa Monica, CA]. it has been clear that these preference differences alone, even if mild, can lead to complete separation of racial groups. Recently published work by [Fossett, Mark. 2006. Ethnic preferences, social distance dynamics. and residential segregation: theoretical explorations using simulation analysis. journal of Mathematical Sociology 30, 185-274] adds even greater certainty to the proposition. We explore this process empirically through a case study of a university housing system that recently experienced an increase in the residential separation between black and white students. Unlike residential segregation in the larger community, separation on the college campus does not have deep roots in institutionalized mechanisms of discrimination. In fact, residence assignment procedures are completely ``color-blind.'' Thus a college campus is an (almost) ideal place to study the role of preferences in residential segregation. We use data on the ranks continuing students give to residence halls in response to their housing applications and we relate the ranks different types of student give to halls of different racial composition. Not surprisingly, we find that percent black is associated with a higher, more preferred, rank for black students, but, surprisingly, we find such an integrationist preference is common among white students as well. However, the effect is much stronger for black than for white students and this difference has important consequences for the residential separation process.	2	Gretchen Koehler; John Skvoretz

Using the New Zealand Census data from 1991 to 2006, we examine the patterns of Asian, Maori, and Pacific people residential segregation from the majority European population. We then assess the effects of ethnic group and geographic level characteristics on the levels of segregation. The results reveal that Pacific people are the most segregated group from Europeans. The levels of segregation have declined only slightly for Maori and Pacific people over time. but increased gradually for Asians. While results show general support for spatial assimilation theory, different sets of factors were found to be associated with levels of segregation for each ethnic minority group.	3	Douglas Grbic; Hiromi Ishizawa; Charles Crothers
Iceland, John, Kimberly Goyette, Kyle Nelson & Chaowen Chan. 2010. 'Racial and Ethnic Residential Segregation and Household Structure: a Research Note.' Social Science Research. 39:1 39-47.	Social Science Research	2010	4	This study examines how patterns of racial and ethnic segregation in U.S. metropolitan areas vary by household structure. Specifically, using tract-level summary files from the 2000 decennial census, we estimated levels of metropolitan segregation for different racial and ethnic groups by household composition and poverty status. We find that when using the dissimilarity index, white households with children, and especially poor ones, are more segregated from black, Hispanic, and Asian households than are white households as a whole. Results from the interaction index provide complimentary information. In large part because nonpoor white married-couple households are more numerous than other groups in most metropolitan areas, Such households tend to have relatively less interaction with other racial and ethnic groups, and black and Hispanic households in particular. In contrast, minority group members often live in neighborhoods with a high proportion of non-Hispanic white households. Among all three minority group families with children, nonpoor married householders had the highest levels of interaction with whites. These results show that household structure shapes racial and ethnic residential patterns in U.S. metropolitan areas.	4	John Iceland; Kimberly A. Goyette; Kyle Anne Nelson; Chaowen Chan
Long, Mark & Marta Tienda. 2010. 'Changes in Texas Universities' Applicant Pools After the Hopwood Decision.' Social Science Research. 39:1 48-66.	Social Science Research	2010	2	This paper evaluates how the distribution of applicant and enrollee attributes at seven Texas universities changed after the Hopwood decision and the implementation of a policy guaranteeing admission to students with high class ranks. We analyze changes in the distributions of test scores and high school class ranks for underrepresented minority groups as well as white and Asian American applicants across institutions and between admission regimes. We show that these admissions policy changes, which have direct effects on only the most selective institutions, have substantial indirect effects at other institutions. Average test scores of applicants to less selective institutions rose following the change in admission criteria, as students with high test scores who did not qualify for the admission guarantee applied to a broader set of institutions. Furthermore, as the share of high rank applicants at UT-Austin rose, the pre-Hopwood assent in the test scores of their applicants stagnated.	2	Mark C. Long; Marta Tienda

Social Science Research	2010	4	In the context of the minority vulnerability thesis, this study assesses whether there are racial differences in the prevalence, determinants, and timing of downward mobility from managerial/executive and professional/technical occupational categories during the critical early career years. Findings from a panel study of income dynamics sample of men support theory: African Americans, compared to Whites, have a greater incidence of downward movement, face a route to downward movement that is less strongly predicted by traditional stratification-based causal factors, and experience mobility quickly. Analyses also reveal that racial gaps in downward mobility along lines enunciated by theory are greater in the private sector than the public sector. Implications of the findings for understanding evolving patterns of racial inequality in privileged occupations are discussed.	2	George Wilson; Vincent J. Roscigno

Social Science Research	2010	1	We capitalize on inter- and intra-state variation in state welfare rules regarding new immigrants to simulate a ``natural experiment'' that provides evidence on the impact of post-reform welfare (TANF) participation on immigrant women's economic self-sufficiency. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (1996-1999 and 2001-2003 panels) and textual data on state welfare rules. we examine three measures of economic well-being - employment. employment stability, and wage trajectories - to obtain a comprehensive picture of immigrants' post-welfare experiences. Findings suggest that immigrant TANF-leavers are no more or less likely to be employed than either TANF-eligible (but not receiving) or TANF-ineligible immigrant women (statistical and natural control groups, respectively). However, given employment. TANF-leavers have substantially longer spells of stable employment and steeper wage trajectories than immigrant women in both control groups.	3	Matthew Hall; Deborah Roempke Graefe; Gordon F. De

Social Science Research	2010	3	This research examines the relationship between work disability and food insecurity, and tests whether the positive association between disability and food insecurity is accounted for by two mechanisms: economic resources and/or competing consumption needs. A sample (N = 6997) is chosen from the 1999 Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) with over 1200 households headed by people with disabilities. Findings support both mechanisms but depending on the levels of food insecurity and the types of family economic resources, their success at explaining the relationship of disability with food insecurity varies. In addition, we find that household assets are more effective than income in protecting people with disabilities against food insecurity. Implications for disability policy and food assistance programs are discussed.	3	Jin Huang; Baorong Guo; Youngmi Kim
Shlay, Anne. 2010. 'African American, White and Hispanic Child Care Preferences: a Factorial Survey Analysis of Welfare Leavers by Race and Ethnicity.' Social Science Research. 39:1 125-141.	Social Science Research	2010	3	This research investigates the child care preferences of poor White, African American and Hispanic parents. Using the factorial survey method, this research examines the impact of race and ethnicity on child care preferences and definitions of child care quality. The findings do not support the conclusion that race and ethnicity are a major source of division in preferences for child care. Rather there was consensus around desired core care attributes associated with child care quality. Across racial and ethnic lines, parents wanted safe and regulated care that was evaluated by a government agency with warm and trained caregivers. Findings suggest that differences in child care use by race and ethnicity may not be due to different preferences for particular types of care, but for bundles of care characteristics people may believe are associated with particular care situations. Different child care choices may not stem from cultural differences, but more from market constraints and lack of information.	1	Anne B. Shlay

Social Science Research	2010	4	This paper tests Samuel and Pearl Oliner's theory that extensivity is a cause of prosocial behaviors, using data from the 1995 and 2005 waves of the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) survey. Principal components analysis of a set of 19 questions about moral obligations supports the Oliners' contention that some individuals have a constricted moral sense, meaning that they feel stronger obligations to help family members and friends than strangers, while others have an extensive moral sense and feel obligated to help both close and distant others. Tobit regression demonstrates that people with extensive moral obligations are more likely than people with constricted obligations to engage in volunteer work and charitable giving. These results provide independent support for the Oliners' theory, and encourage further research on extensivity.	1	Christopher J. Einolf
Whitmeyer, Joseph & Rafael Wittek. 2010. 'Inequalities in Network Structures.' Social Science Research. 39:1 152-164.	Social Science Research	2010	0	We use a model of continuous attachments in networks to generate propositions concerning inequalities in network structures, and test the propositions on data from organizational settings. Our network model, inspired by that of [Gould, Roger 2002. The origins of status hierarchies: A formal theory and empirical test. American Journal of Sociology 107, 1143-1178], is based on a theoretically informed actor model, in which each network member sets attachment strengths based on perceived partner quality, reciprocity, influence from others, attribute homophily, and attachment resistance. A computer algorithm finds the single robust equilibrium configuration of attachment strengths. This allows us to generate six propositions concerning inequalities at the individual, dyadic, triadic, and network levels. We test the propositions on network data for four kinds of attachments over four waves for five organizations, and find that the results generally support the propositions. The results suggest that partner quality, reciprocity, and attachment resistance are the most important elements in the network members' choices.	2	Joseph M. Whitmeyer; Rafael Wittek
Nielsen, Amie, Terrence Hill, Michael French & Monique Hernandez. 2010. 'Racial/ethnic Composition, Social Disorganization, and Offsite Alcohol Availability in San Diego County, California.' Social Science Research. 39:1 165-175.	Social Science Research	2010	6	We draw upon social disorganization theory to examine the effects of community characteristics on the distribution of offsite alcohol outlets in San Diego County, California. Of particular interest is whether alcohol availability varies according to neighborhood racial/ethnic composition once measures of social disorganization (socioeconomic disadvantage, residential instability, and racial/ethnic heterogeneity) are controlled. Using data from the 1990 Census and 1993 alcohol license reports, we estimate a series of negative binomial regression models with corrections for spatial autocorrelation. The results show that percent Asian is associated with lower offsite alcohol outlet density. Once socioeconomic disadvantage is controlled, percent Latino is related to lower alcohol availability. Although similar suppressor patterns are observed, percent Black is generally unrelated to outlet density. Consistent with social disorganization theory, socioeconomic disadvantage and residential instability predict increased alcohol availability. Neighborhood racial/ethnic composition is either unrelated or inversely related to outlet density once social disorganization and other neighborhood characteristics are taken into account.	4	Amie L.

Warner, Tara, Diana Fishbein & Christopher Krebs. 2010. 'the Risk of Assimilating? Alcohol Use Among Immigrant and Us-born Mexican Youth.' Social Science Research. 39:1 176-186.	Social Science Research	2010	2	Rising rates of substance use among Hispanic youth, coupled with substantial growth of this minority group, merit grounds for concern. The process of assimilation is frequently examined in studies of Hispanic substance use and has been cited as a reason for higher rates of substance use by U.S.-born Hispanics, compared to their foreign-born peers. However, many previous studies use individual or unidimensional measures of assimilation, when this term is multifaceted. representing different concepts. The current study addresses this gap by testing the longitudinal effect of different assimilation processes (acculturation as well as structural, spatial, and straight-line assimilation), while simultaneously controlling for important familial and social risk and protective factors on the likelihood of alcohol use among U.S.-born Mexican and Mexican immigrant youth. Results indicate that, although alcohol use is higher among immigrant youth, assimilation measures do not predict alcohol use for immigrants or U.S.-born youth. We conclude that the effects of assimilation may vary by person and place. particularly in ethnic enclaves, and suggest the use of measures that incorporate cultural, personal, social, and environmental factors.	3	Tara D.

Gauthier, Jacques-Antoine, Eric Widmer, Philipp Bucher & Cedric Notredame. 2010. 'Multichannel Sequence Analysis Applied to Social Science Data.' Sociological Methodology. 40:1 1-38.	Sociological Methodology	2010	2	Applications of optimal matching analysis in the social sciences are typically based on sequences of specific social statuses that model the residential, family, or occupational trajectories of individuals. Despite the broadly recognized interdependence of these statuses, few attempts have been made to systematize the ways in which optimal matching analysis should be applied multidimensionally-that is, in an approach that takes into account multiple trajectories simultaneously. Based on methods pioneered in the field of bioinformatics, this paper proposes a method of multichannel sequence analysis (MCSA) that simultaneously extends the usual optimal matching analysis (OMA) to multiple life spheres. Using data from the Swiss household panel (SHP), we examine the types of trajectories obtained using MCSA. We also consider a random data set and find that MCSA offers an alternative to the sole use of ex-post sum of distance matrices by locally aligning distinct life trajectories simultaneously. Moreover, MCSA reduces the complexity of the typologies it allows to produce, without making them less informative. It is more robust to noise in the data, and it provides more reliable alignments than two independent OMA.	4	Jacques-Antoine Gauthier; Eric D. Widmer; Philipp Bucher; Cedric Notredame

Sociological Methodology. 40:1 39-73.	Sociological Methodology	2010	6	Event history data constitute a valuable source to analyze life courses, although the reliance of such data on autobiographical memory raises many concerns over their reliability. In this paper, we use Swedish survey data to investigate bias in retrospective reports of employment biographies, applying a novel model-based latent Markov method. A descriptive comparison of the biographies as reconstructed by the same respondents at two interviews carried out about 10 years apart reveals that careers appear simpler and less heterogeneous and have fewer elements and episodes when reported at a point long after their occurrence, with a particularly high underreport of unemployment. Using matching techniques, the dissimilarity between the two reconstructions turns out to be unaffected by respondents' sociodemographic characteristics but particularly affected by the occurrence of unemployment spells and career complexity. Using latent Markov models, we assume correlated errors across occasions to determine the measurement error and to obtain a more reliable estimate of the (true) latent state occupied at a particular time point. The results confirm that (correlated) measurement errors lead to simplification and conventionalism. Career complexity makes recall particularly problematic at longer recall distances, whereas unemployment underreporting also happens very close to the interview. However, only a small fraction of respondents make consistent errors over time, while the great majority makes no errors at all.	4	Anna Manzoni; Jeroen K. Vermunt; Ruud Luijkx; Ruud Muffels
Pearl, Judea. 2010. 'the Foundations of Causal Inference.' Sociological Methodology. 40:1 75-149.	Sociological Methodology	2010	9	This paper reviews recent advances in the foundations of causal inference and introduces a systematic methodology for defining, estimating, and testing causal claims in experimental and observational studies. It is based on nonparametric structural equation models (SEM)-a natural generalization of those used by econometricians and social scientists in the 1950s and 1960s, which provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring the effects of potential interventions (also called ``causal effects'' or ``policy evaluation''), as well as direct and indirect effects (also known as ``mediation''), in both linear and nonlinear systems. Finally, the paper clarifies the role of propensity score matching in causal analysis, defines the relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks, and develops symbiotic tools that use the strong features of both.	1	Judea Pearl
An, Weihua. 2010. 'Bayesian Propensity Score Estimators: Incorporating Uncertainties in Propensity Scores Into Causal Inference.' Sociological Methodology. 40:1 151-189.	Sociological Methodology	2010	1	Despite their popularity, conventional propensity score estimators (PSEs) do not take into account uncertainties in propensity scores. This paper develops Bayesian propensity score estimators (BPSEs) to model the joint likelihood of both propensity score and outcome in one step, which naturally incorporates such uncertainties into causal inference. Simulations show that PSEs using estimated propensity scores tend to overestimate variations in the estimates of treatment effects that is, too often they provide larger than necessary standard errors and lead to overly conservative inference whereas BPSEs provide correct standard errors for the estimates of treatment effects and valid inference. Compared with other variance adjustment methods, BPSEs are guaranteed to provide positive standard errors, more reliable in small samples, can be readily employed to draw inference on individual treatment effects, etc. To illustrate the proposed methods, BPSEs are applied to evaluating a job training program.

Yuan, Ke-Hai & Peter Bentler. 2010. 'Finite Normal Mixture Sem Analysis by Fitting Multiple Conventional Sem Models.' Sociological Methodology. 40:1 191-245.	Sociological Methodology	2010	0	This paper proposes a two-stage maximum likelihood (ML) approach to normal mixture structural equation modeling (SEM) and develops a statistical inference that allows distributional misspecification. Saturated means and covariances are estimated at stage 1 together with a sandwich-type covariance matrix. These are used to evaluate structural models at stage 2. Techniques accumulated in the conventional SEM literature for model diagnosis and evaluation can be used to study the model structure for each component. Examples show that the two-stage ML approach leads to correct or nearly correct models even when the normal mixture assumptions are violated and initial models are misspecified. Compared to single-stage ML, two-stage ML avoids the confounding effect of model specification and the number of components, and it is computationally more efficient. Monte Carlo results indicate that two-stage ML loses only minimal efficiency under the condition where single-stage ML performs best. Monte Carlo results also indicate that the commonly used model selection criterion BIC is more robust to distribution violations for the saturated model than that for a structural model at moderate sample sizes. The proposed two-stage ML approach is also extremely flexible in modeling different components with different models. Potential new developments in the mixture modeling literature can be easily adapted to study issues with normal mixture SEM.	2	Ke-Hai Yuan; Peter M. Bentler
Lukociene, Olga, Roberta Varriale & Jeroen Vermunt. 2010. 'the Simultaneous Decision(s) About the Number of Lower- and Higher-level Classes in Multilevel Latent Class Analysis.' Sociological Methodology. 40:1 247-283.	Sociological Methodology	2010	6	Recently, several types of extensions of the latent class ( LC) model have been developed for the analysis of data sets having a multilevel structure. The most popular variant is the multilevel LC model with finite mixture distributions at multiple levels of a hierarchical structure: that is, with LCs for both lower-level units (e.g. individuals, citizens, or patients) and higher-level units (e.g. groups, regions, or hospitals). A problem in the application of this model is that determining the number of LCs is much more complicated than in standard (single-level) LC analysis because it involves multiple, nonindependent decisions. We propose a three-step model-fitting procedure for deciding about the number of higher- and lower-level classes. We also investigate the performance of information criteria (BIC, AIC, CAIC, and AIC3) in the context of multilevel LC analysis; with different types of response variables. A specific difficulty associated with using BIC and CAIC in any type of multilevel analysis is that these measures contain the sampie size in their formulae, and we investigate whether this should be the number of groups, the number of individuals, or either the number of groups or individuals depending on whether one has to decide about model features concerning the higher or lower level. The three main conclusions of our simulations studies are that (1) the proposed three-step model-fitting strategy works rather well, (2) the number of higher-level units (K) is the preferred sample size for BIC and CAIC, both for decisions about higher- and lower-level classes, and (3) with categorical indicators, AIC3 and BIC based on the higher-level sample size are the preferred measures for deciding about the number of LCs at both the higher and lower level. With continuous indicators, BIC(K) performs better than AIC3. AIC performs best in very specific situations namely, with poorly separated classes and categorical indicators.	3	Olga Lukociene; Roberta Varriale; Jeroen K. Vermunt
Gile, Krista & Mark Handcock. 2010. 'Respondent-driven Sampling: an Assessment of Current Methodology.' Sociological Methodology. 40:1 285-327.	Sociological Methodology	2010	49	Respondent-driven sampling (RDS) employs a variant of a link-tracing network sampling strategy to collect data from hard-to-reach populations. By tracing the links in the underlying social network, the process exploits the social structure to expand the sample and reduce its dependence on the initial (convenience) sample. The current estimators of population averages make strong assumptions in order to treat the data as a probability sample. We evaluate three critical sensitivities of the estimators: (1) to bias induced by the initial sample, (2) to uncontrollable features of respondent behavior, and (3) to the without-replacement structure of sampling. Our analysis indicates: (1) that the convenience sample of seeds can induce bias, and the number of sample waves typically used in RDS is likely insufficient for the type of nodal mixing required to obtain the reputed asymptotic unbiasedness; (2) that preferential referral behavior by respondents leads to bias; (3) that when a substantial fraction of the target population is sampled the current estimators can have substantial bias. This paper sounds a cautionary note for the users of RDS. While current RDS methodology is powerful and clever, the favorable statistical properties claimed for the current estimates are shown to be heavily dependent on often unrealistic assumptions. We recommend ways to improve the methodology.	2	Krista J. Gile; Mark S. Handcock
Steglich, Christian, Tom Snijders & Michael Pearson. 2010. 'Dynamic Networks and Behavior: Separating Selection From Influence.' Sociological Methodology. 40:1 329-393.	Sociological Methodology	2010	58	A recurrent problem in the analysis of behavioral dynamics, given a simultaneously evolving social network, is the difficulty of separating the effects of partner selection from the effects of social influence. Because misattribution of selection effects to social influence, or vice versa, suggests wrong conclusions about the social mechanisms underlying the observed dynamics', special diligence in data analysis is advisable. While a dependable and valid method would benefit several research areas, according to the best of our knowledge, it has been lacking in the extant literature. In this paper, we present a recently developed family of statistical models that enables researchers to separate the two effects in a statistically adequate manner. To illustrate our method, we investigate the roles of homophile selection and peer influence mechanisms in the joint dynamics of friendship formation and substance use among adolescents. Making use of a three-wave panel measured in the years 1995-1997 at a school in Scotland, we are able to assess the strength of selection and influence mechanisms and quantify the relative contributions of homophile selection, assimilation to peers, and control mechanisms to observed similarity of substance use among friends.	3	Christian Steglich; Tom A.

Hidalgo, Danielle & Carl Bankston. 2010. 'Reinforcing Polarizations: Us Immigration and the Prospect of Gay Marriage.' Sociological Spectrum. 30:1 4-29.	Sociological Spectrum	2010	0	In recent years more legal immigrants have entered the United States through marriage than through any other means, while the desirability of current levels and types of immigration has been a matter of controversy. The United States has also been engaged in a heated public debate over the nature and definition of marriage for the past decade. The source of this debate has been the question of whether the legal status of marriage should be extended to same-sex couples. In this study, we want to point out that these two controversies, over immigration policy and over sexuality and marriage, are, in fact, closely connected. First, we observe that sexuality was historically an explicit basis for the exclusion or inclusion of immigrants. Next, we argue that the changes in U.S. immigration reform of 1965 made sexuality an implicit basis for entry by making heterosexual marriage the primary avenue for migration to the United States. Then, we maintain that American attitudes toward same-sex relations in general, and toward same-sex marriage in particular, have become increasingly polarized at the same time that controversies over immigration have intensified. Moreover, these two controversies are statistically connected in attitudes, as well as connected in history and policy: Attitudes toward same-sex marriage are related to attitudes toward immigration. Finally, we suggest that if same-sex marriage becomes a reality, polarization on both matters is likely mutually reinforcing, in the sense that polarization of attitudes toward marriage will intensify polarization of attitudes toward immigration and vice versa, with several important social consequences.	2	Danielle Antoinette Hidalgo; Carl L.

Sociological Spectrum	2010	6	Recent surveys have found antigay attitudes and behavior to be commonplace. In this article, we use contact theory to explain these prejudicial attitudes. We contribute to the literature on contact and prejudice by expanding contact to include not only whether the heterosexual knows any gay men or lesbians, but also how many, for how long, and in what ways. To these, we add a new and unique measure of contact: a person's contact with the gay community. The data are from a survey of 956 undergraduate students at a large urban university in the southeastern United States. Ordinary least squares (OLS) regression analyses find that contact with gay men and lesbians significantly reduces prejudice toward them; although, only as contact with gay friends or the gay community. Contact has stronger effects on women's prejudice than men's prejudice; however, the attitudes of African Americans toward lesbians and gay men are unaffected by gay contact. The results suggest that contact intervenes between prejudice and sex, race, religiosity, and gender attitudes.	3	Dawn M. Baunach; Elisabeth O. Burgess; Courtney S. Muse

Sociological Spectrum	2010	1	This research explores white-black differences in adolescent heterosexual romantic involvement and how these differences are shaped by social context. We find that, parallel to patterns of marriage in adulthood, non-Hispanic white girls are more likely to be in a romantic relationship than African American girls. This is particularly true when we focus on heterosexual romantic relationships formed with schoolmates. Among boys, African Americans are more likely to be romantically involved than non-Hispanic whites. We investigate the contribution of two broad types of social-demographic factors to these race-ethnic differences, population composition and normative climate. We develop theory about why being a numerical minority should lead to lower levels of relationship formation, especially when interracial relationships are rare. Results support the population composition hypotheses, but not the idea that race-ethnic differences arise because of differences in normative climate.	2	R. Kelly Raley; M. Kate Sullivan

Six elements are identified that link these forms of music. These are: call and response, focus on the voice, percussion backbeat to create energy, functionality in nature, focus on the experiences of daily living, and oral history. These suggest a great influence of West African music on the United States military marching cadences.	3	David G. LoConto; Timothy W. Clark; Patrice N. Ware

Sociological Spectrum	2010	2	Although the impact of religious affiliation on social attitudes is a popular research topic in the sociology of religion, few scholars have examined the role that race plays in this relationship. Moreover, studies that do explore the interplay of race and religious affiliation seldom move beyond the general categories of conservative, moderate, and liberal denominational families. Our research uses recent data from the General Social Surveys to compare the social attitudes of African Americans and their white counterparts within established designations of religious affiliation. Along with control variables, we include attitude measures for political tolerance, legalized abortion, gender equality, premarital sex, homosexual lifestyles, and extramarital sexual relations. Our analysis isolates levels of support for these attitudes within categories of race and religious affiliation to determine whether variations emerge and whether they are nested within specific issues, religious denominations, or reflect more general patterns of race differences.	2	David A.

Specifically, network connections to heterogeneous contacts (racially heterophilous ties, weak ties, and high-status ties) appear to be more effective for black coaches than for white coaches. The findings underscore the importance and complexity of the relationships between race, social capital, and occupational mobility.	2	Jacob C. Day; Steve McDonald

Sociological Spectrum	2010	0	Drawing from in-depth interviews, participant observation, and document analysis we examine a contentious environmental dispute surrounding contamination from a decommissioned zinc smelter plant in rural Oklahoma. Environmental grievances center around potential health effects associated with lead, cadmium, and arsenic contamination. The company that owns the former zinc smelter facility argues that they are operating in compliance with all environmental health and safety standards and many citizens applaud their ongoing remediation efforts. In an effort to improve its public image, the company has launched a community outreach program and is offering to sample residents' yards. A group of concerned citizens, however, believes that the health and safety of their community have been compromised by the environmental contamination. These residents have garnered legal support from a nonlocal law firm and they plan to pursue legal damages as part of their campaign of environmental cleanup. Both sides have engaged in a heated public dialogue to mobilize support for their respective campaigns. The results of our study indicate that the environmental dispute is centered on the ambiguity of harm and conflicting perceptions of causation.	3	Chris M. Messer; Thomas E. Shriver; Dennis Kennedy

Sociological Spectrum	2010	1	Rates of teen pregnancy in the United States are significantly higher than those in most other industrialized nations. This is troubling in light of the consequences to teen mothers, their children, and society. Some suggest that teen pregnancies can be decreased by providing sex education in the public school system, while others believe that sex education is inappropriate for public school. Little research exists, however, on predictors of attitudes toward sex education, and most existing research is dated and lacks a theoretical framework. Guided by the seminal work of Ira L. Reiss, we examine the impact of labor shortages, religiosity, militarism, gender egalitarianism, regulation of sexuality, and a naturalistic view of sexuality on attitudes toward sex education. Results suggest that Hispanics, those with high levels of religiosity, and those who supported regulation of sexuality were significantly less likely to support sex education in public schools. Implications of the findings and directions for future research are discussed.	3	Allison T. Chappell; Scott R. Maggard; Sarah A. Gibson
Gonsoulin, Margaret. 2010. 'Gender Ideology and Status Attainment of Conservative Christian Women in the 21st Century.' Sociological Spectrum. 30:2 220-240.	Sociological Spectrum	2010	0	Theoretically derived measures and hypotheses concerning the connection between family ideology, gender ideals, and status attainment levels of conservative Christian women are examined in the twenty-first century. Conservative Christian women have a more intensive view of mothering, a stronger prolife stance, a younger age of childbearing, a higher number of children and a lower education level. These trends tend to intensify for women who convert to conservative churches after the age of 16 and reduce for women who engage in wage-work. A belief in Biblical inerrancy directly reduces educational attainment as does a higher intensity of mothering, a younger age of childbearing, and higher number of children. While there is no discernible direct effect of religiosity on income level, there is an indirect effect that is important to note.	1	Margaret E. Gonsoulin

Shihadeh, Edward & Raymond Barranco. 2010. 'Leveraging the Power of the Ethnic Enclave: Residential Instability and Violence in Latino Communities.' Sociological Spectrum. 30:3 249-269.	Sociological Spectrum	2010	4	Early Chicago school thinkers linked crime to the disorganizing influx of Eastern European immigrants and black migrants from the South. Extending this to contemporary concerns, we use Census and Vital Statistics data to examine whether migration to ethnic enclaves among Latinos and blacks raises violence. It appears that when Latinos settle in their ethnic enclaves, violence in their communities declines. Contrary to Chicago school assertions, this improves economic conditions and strengthens group ties as the community mobilizes to receive newcomers. In contrast, such migration does not dampen violence in black communities. We discuss the implications of this for ecological theorizing.	2	Edward S. Shihadeh; Raymond E. Barranco
Liu, Eric & F. Mencken. 2010. 'Fatalistic Voluntarism and Life Happiness in Post-socialist China.' Sociological Spectrum. 30:3 270-288.	Sociological Spectrum	2010	5	Fatalism has been recognized by sociologists as a key concept in sociology. Recent debates on fatalism revolve around the way theological fatalism influences the individual and society. Unfortunately, little has been said about the topic in the communist and post-communist world. Using recent data from a national survey of residents in People's Republic of China (P.R. China), this article examines the relationship between fatalistic voluntarism and life happiness in the context of China's Marxist-atheist monopoly. Results show that fatalistic voluntarism has a significant, positive net effect on life happiness among those Chinese who believe in fate control. Implications of this study are discussed.	2	Eric Y.

Rice, Julie. 2010. 'Viewing Trade Liberalization Through a Feminist Lens: a Content Analysis of the Counterhegemonic Discourse of Gender and Trade Advocacy Groups.' Sociological Spectrum. 30:3 289-316.	Sociological Spectrum	2010	0	An intersectional feminist approach informs qualitative content analyses of gender and trade advocacy websites in order to gain insights into the relation between trade liberalization and women in the global South. Findings include these websites are advocating for more representation in policymaking institutions spanning the global and local divide; emphasizing the need for networks within and outside institutions; and advocating for alternatives to free trade. The diverse and often contradictory understandings and strategies displayed by these websites arise from concern with giving voice to local needs and women in the South. These findings underscore the contributions a feminist approach makes to global political economy research by bringing attention to the heterogeneity of global political economic processes and power relations, and providing insights as to how global counter-hegemonic efforts can embrace diversity rather than being homogenizing.	1	Julie Steinkopf Rice
Boyd, Robert. 2010. 'Ethnic Shopkeepers in Us Cities in the Late Nineteenth Century.' Sociological Spectrum. 30:3 317-337.	Sociological Spectrum	2010	0	The literature on retail entrepreneurship makes an important distinction between shopkeeping and petty trading. Building on this literature, the present study addresses two questions about retail enterprise in U.S. cities in the late nineteenth century: To what extent were retail entrepreneurs from the Southern, Central, and Eastern (SCE) European groups shopkeepers rather than petty traders? And which region of the country offered the best opportunities for retail entrepreneurs from these groups to become shopkeepers? Census data from 1900 show that: (1) retail entrepreneurs from these immigrant groups were more likely to be petty traders than shopkeepers; and (2) the opportunities for these entrepreneurs to become shopkeepers were greatest in the South, an emerging peripheral region with relatively small immigrant communities. These findings cast doubt on the conventional view that conditions in major northern cities bolstered shopkeeping among entrepreneurial groups, such as Russian and Polish Jews, in the late nineteenth century.	1	Robert L.

Baxter, Vern. 2010. 'Prosperity, Immigration, and Neighborhood Change in Silicon Valley: 1990-2000.' Sociological Spectrum. 30:3 338-364.	Sociological Spectrum	2010	0	This article uses panel data collected at the block group level from the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Census to explore neighborhood change in the Silicon Valley region of Northern California. This was a period of rapid economic expansion and displacement of the white majority by immigrants of Asian and Hispanic descent. The argument that economic prosperity promotes ethnic group assimilation is confronted by mixed findings that ethnic residential segregation intensified in Silicon Valley during the 1990s, regardless of the income level of neighborhoods, and that some second generation immigrants have begun to assimilate residentially. Results support the argument that more recent immigrants, regardless of education, are likely to reside in areas populated by members of their ethnic group. In addition, upward mobility does not necessarily mean ethnic minorities will leave ethnic neighborhoods and desegregate the larger metropolitan area, which also creates the potential for proliferation of more affluent ethnic neighborhoods.	1	Vern Baxter
Fitzgerald, Scott & Beth Rubin. 2010. 'Risk Society, Media, and Power: the Case of Nanotechnology.' Sociological Spectrum. 30:4 367-402.	Sociological Spectrum	2010	1	Risk society theory posits that the transformation of industrial to postindustrial society corresponded with a transformation of societal power structured by capital, to one structured by the ability to define risk. Perceptions of risk are, in part, socially constructed and created through the framing efforts of various institutional actors. The resulting struggle over meaning is particularly acute when the issues contain many unknown elementsas is the case with emerging technologies. Applying insights from media studies, frame analysis, and organizational theory, we analyze coverage of nanotechnology (NT) in popular press, trade, and general science publications. The findings document the extent to which the risks of this emerging technology are presented or ignored across, between, and within organizational subfields. The analysis empirically assesses a key proposition of risk society theory and reveals how institutional processes reflect and reproduce power differentials. We discuss the implications of the empirical findings for sociological theories of risk and society, power, and collective action.	2	Scott T. Fitzgerald; Beth A. Rubin
Lu, Alexander. 2010. 'Litigation and Subterfuge: Chinese Immigrant Mobilization During the Chinese Exclusion Era.' Sociological Spectrum. 30:4 403-432.	Sociological Spectrum	2010	1	I analyze historical changes in American immigration law and the subsequent responses of Chinese immigrants during the Chinese Exclusion Era. Using the political process model's concept of opolitical opportunity structure,o I examine how the indeterminate nature of the Chinese Exclusion laws provided key opportunities for mobilization. I present an interactive framework that considers not only how the broader political environment enabled and constrained the Chinese, but also how they responded by actively reshaping their environment. I apply this framework to the Chinese community's initial use of litigation and their move towards tactics of subterfuge in response to changes in Chinese exclusion policies. My findings show that the anti-Chinese immigration policies basically fulfilled their purpose, but led to unintended exploitation due to problematic language and enforcement.	1	Alexander Lu

Sociological Spectrum	2010	0	We examine how ministers in two religious traditions use discourse on secular visual media as a means of establishing symbolic group boundaries. We compare content in 100 evangelical and mainline Protestant sermons, each of which makes at least one reference to secular cinema. We find that mainline ministers largely promote oexpandingo boundaries with secular culture, that evangelical ministers promote ocontractingo and oexpandingo boundaries in roughly equal measure, and that ministers from both traditions sometimes promote oselectively permeableo boundaries. We explore prevailing frames employed by ministers to promote the respective boundaries, and we discuss implications for studies of culture and religion.	2	Scott Draper; Jerry Z. Park

One understudied area within gender scholarship is the content and implications of sexist humor as a form of sexism. In this article, we explore the sexist content of 153 Internet jokes. Our analysis demonstrates that sexist jokes offer portrayals of misogyny that serve many functions, some of which include the sexual objectification of women, devaluation of their personal and professional abilities, and support of violence against women. Implications of such humor are discussed as well as future research possibilities in this area.	2	Michelle L. Bemiller; Rachel Zimmer Schneider

Sociological Spectrum	2010	0	In order to further develop an understanding of the Southern subculture of violence and its association with female-perpetrated homicide, new techniques must be developed that sufficiently operationalize Southern cultural influence. For this study, we created the Southern Subculture Index, a factor combining a county's population born in the South, Evangelical Christian, and of Scots-Irish ancestry. Specifically, we hypothesize that by using this index, the relationship between female-perpetrated homicide and Southern culture will be visible. Results from a negative binomial regression model confirm the veracity of a positive and significant effect of the Southern Subculture Index on female-perpetrated homicide.	3	Julia M.

Kerley, Kent, John Bartkowski, Todd Matthews & Tracy Emond. 2010. 'From the Sanctuary to the Slammer: Exploring the Narratives of Evangelical Prison Ministry Workers.' Sociological Spectrum. 30:5 504-525.	Sociological Spectrum	2010	1	Current survey research reveals that religious conservatives exhibit more punitive attitudes toward criminal offenders than their nonreligious and mainline counterparts. Despite the pervasiveness of conservative Protestant support for the punitive treatment of criminal offenders, evangelical-run prison ministry programs have proliferated in recent decades. This study uses in-depth interviews to examine the motivations of prison ministry workers. The narratives demonstrate that prison ministry workers embrace a distinctive orientation of compassion and, through sustained contact with inmates, they negotiate the tension between conservative religious values and their practical experiences working in prison ministry. From this overarching theme of compassion, three important subthemes emerged: (1) the calling of prison ministry, (2) special connections to the prison context, and (3) a sense of comfort and security with inmates. Overall, we observe how prison ministers negotiate two competing moral logics-judgment and compassion-in light of their religious convictions and experiences with inmate outreach.	4	Kent R.

Zavala, Egbert & Ryan Spohn. 2010. 'Emotional Abuse and Controlling Behaviors in Heterosexual Relationships: the Role of Employment and Alcohol Use for Women and Their Partners.' Sociological Spectrum. 30:5 526-549.	Sociological Spectrum	2010	0	The purpose of this study is to examine the role of economic resources, status compatibility, and alcohol consumption on forms of nonphysical abuse, such as controlling and emotional abuse. Specifically, we focus on the connections between women's employment, the employment of their partners, alcohol use, and women's risk of abuse in intimate relationships. We hypothesize that women in intimate relationships with men will experience more emotional abuse to the extent that they are economically vulnerable. Moreover, abuse should increase if their employment status, in relation to that of their partner, challenges the man's marital power. Moreover, alcohol use by women and/or their partners is also predicted to be associated with emotional abuse. We find some support for assertions that socioeconomic deprivation, as well as challenges to men's masculinity, is associated with emotionally abusive male partners. However, the prevalence and amount of alcohol use by the male partner stands out as the most consistent predictor of emotional abuse in heterosexual relationships.	2	Egbert Zavala; Ryan E. Spohn

Sociological Spectrum. 30:5 550-579.	Sociological Spectrum	2010	1	This analysis extends prior research on racial inequality in arrest rates by testing opposing hypotheses derived from the civic community tradition in sociology. One interpretation of this perspective suggests that communities with a locally-oriented economic infrastructure, an abundance of civic institutions, and civically engaged citizens should exhibit lower racial disparity in arrest rates. On the other hand, recent writings exposing a potential ``dark side'' of social capital suggest that civic community may exacerbate such racial disparties. Using spatial regression models to analyze data from nearly 1,800 U. S. counties, the current analysis examines these competing hypotheses regarding the effects of civic community. Results suggest mixed support for both the traditional and ``dark side'' predictions. Implications for theory and empirical research are discussed.	2	Graham C. Ousey; Matthew R. Lee

Utilizing data from the child sample of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (N=206), we examine the construction of adolescent gender ideology via mothers' and fathers' gender beliefs. Further, we consider the interaction between maternal and paternal ideologies as they influence adolescent ideology. Findings suggest that paternal ideology plays a strong role in adolescent ideology formation, both directly and as a moderator of maternal influence.	2	Shannon N. Davis; Jeremiah B. Wills

Sociological Spectrum	2010	0	In this address, I review available published presidential addresses written by presidents of various sociological organizations as a way of thinking about sociology and what sociologists may find important. Using Eller's categorizations, I divide the articles into three types including (1) query of the profession in which the author discussed the history of sociology or its future; (2) a call for new directions in methodologies or theories within sociology; and (3) a focus on the author/president's research. Then, I focus on what is missing in most presidential addresses given by sociologists: sociologists' role as educators and the impact we have upon students. I find that most presidential addresses do not include any or only passing nods to our responsibilities as teachers. I end the address with a call to consider our responsibilities and impact as teachers.	1	Kim Davies

Sociological Spectrum	2010	2	Several scholars claim that group cohesion among black Americans is necessary for black advancement. Our research examines the extent to which group cohesion is possible given the increasing diversity of Black America, particularly with regard to race and class. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 33 middle-class blacks and 40 black-white biracials, we explore (1) the similarities and differences in the experiences of both groups, (2) their encounters with marginalization, (3) how they negotiate perceived marginalization, and (4) the extent to which all of the above are shaped by socially constructed ideas of blackness. We find that narrow notions of oauthentico blackness challenge group cohesion and threaten to splinter the black community along class and ethnic/racial lines. However, we find evidence of greater tolerance for the community's racial diversity than its class diversity. Nevertheless, the data presented here suggest that the increasing heterogeneity of Black America poses significant challenges to group cohesion.	2	Cherise A. Harris; Nikki Khanna

In particular, we examine how well indicators of social support and integration explain the immigrant health advantage. Results show clear evidence of an immigrant paradox in physical health, but that measures of support and integration explain almost none of the immigration effect on physical health.	3	Bridget K.

Johnson, Jennifer. 2010. 'Using Gender: the Personal, Interpersonal, and Emotional Strategies of Domestic Labor.' Sociological Spectrum. 30:6 695-724.	Sociological Spectrum	2010	0	Traditional research on domestic labor has conceptualized work done in support of the home as one of the quintessential ways of odoingo gender. New directions in gender and ritual theory raise the possibility that domestic labor may also be about strategy, usefulness and intentions. Through interviews with 24 married couples, I explore the subjective experiences of men and women as they odoo their domestic labor. I find that while husbands and wives are continuing to do gender as a response to interactional accountability demands, they also ouseo domestic labor as a vehicle through which they (1) reciprocally craft their gender identity, (2) symbolically communicate with their spouse, and (3) garner emotional energy. Furthermore, the men and women strategically mobilized specific tasks that are most useful in achieving these goals inside their unique dyadic schemas. Through these narratives, I explore the possibility that men and women not only do gender but they can use gender as well.	1	Jennifer A. Johnson
Griffiths, Heather & Christopher Steinbrecher. 2010. 'the Colonel's Strategy: Kfc, Peta, and Superficial Appeasement.' Sociological Spectrum. 30:6 725-741.	Sociological Spectrum	2010	0	Researchers analyzed YUM(!) Brand/Kentucky Fried Chicken's (KFC's) response to the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals' (PETA's) KFC cruelty campaign in order to add a new component to the current organizational deviance literature related to how corporations defend themselves against attacks. KFC's reaction to PETA's attempts to label it deviant is a unique pattern of response we dub strategic interaction, in which each tactic used by PETA is met with a new and adaptive response by KFC. After an extensive campaign, PETA was still unable to succeed at changing KFC's policies. We attempt to explain PETA's lack of success in terms of superficial appeasement and appropriation. Superficial appeasement is a newly identified stalling tactic, which may provide organizations with the time they need to create a history of corporate responsibility in response to accusations of deviance. Appropriation involved KFC's co-optation of a joint panel that was intended to facilitate dialogue between the two organizations, but instead became almost entirely filled with panelists sympathetic to KFC's existing corporate policies, a technique that may facilitate other corporations attempting to defend themselves.	2	Heather M.

Langenkamp, Amy. 2010. 'Academic Vulnerability and Resilience During the Transition to High School: the Role of Social Relationships and District Context.' Sociology of Education. 83:1 1-19.	Sociology of Education	2010	8	The transition to high school is a critical stage in students' academic trajectories and can be especially difficult for middle school students who struggle academically. Starting high school on a low academic track and with low academic performance often leads to dropping out of high school. This study investigates what might protect academically vulnerable students during the transition to high school by exploring the potential effects social relationships and changing context have on academic outcomes in high school. As students move from middle school to high school, their social relationships are transformed. The degree to which social relationships change is in part a function of the way school districts are organized. The results suggest that middle school social relationships are protective against low academic outcomes in the first year of high school, but not for low-achieving middle school students. In addition, a district context characterized by greater reconfiguration of peer social relationships is not associated with math course placement but protects against course failure, especially among low-achieving middle school students. These results suggest implications for the way districts organize students and how contexts of school transitions have the potential to provide resilience.	1	Amy G. Langenkamp

Sociology of Education	2010	10	Prior research has not examined how much of the socioeconomic status (SES) advantage on schooling outcomes is related to participation in extracurricular activities. The authors explore the SES advantage and extracurricular participation in elementary school-aged children, with a focus on noncognitive skills. The authors argue that noncognitive skills mediate the influence of SES and extracurricular activities on academic skills. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Class of 1998-99, the authors find that extracurricular participation explains a modest portion of the SES advantage in noncognitive and cognitive skills. In addition, the influence of extracurricular participation on both noncognitive and cognitive skills varies by children's SES.	2	Elizabeth Covay; William Carbonaro

Sociology of Education. 83:1 46-66.	Sociology of Education	2010	5	Over the second half of the twentieth century, changes occurred in parent reports of their engagement in cognitive activities with their young children in the United States. This article argues that the growing trend of parenting for cognitive development in young children in the latter half of the twentieth century is associated with the institutionalization of mass schooling and the legitimization of cognitive development as a central feature of early childhood. The results show that all parents increasingly spent more time engaging in activities related to cognitive development so that by 199 1, it was normative behavior. In addition, the results show that mothers' education became an increasingly better predictor of parenting for cognitive development over the second half of the twentieth century but in the last decade of the twentieth century, the association with mothers' education remained constant or diminished slightly as all families increasingly engaged in cognitive development activities.	1	Maryellen Schaub
Yamamoto, Yoko & Mary Brinton. 2010. 'Cultural Capital in East Asian Educational Systems: the Case of Japan.' Sociology of Education. 83:1 67-83.	Sociology of Education	2010	9	Cultural capital has been an important but often elusive concept in the study of educational processes and social class reproduction. The authors suggest that this is partly because a country's educational system and ways of evaluating students at different educational transitions set the context for the mechanisms through which embodied and objectified cultural capital operate. Moreover, parents in some societies invest in children's ``shadow education'' (extracurricular classes or tutoring) at key educational transitions, and it is not clear whether this replaces cultural capital or supplements it. The authors use data from Japan, a country whose educational system depends heavily but not exclusively on standardized examinations, to examine how cultural capital affects students' progress at three points in the educational process that involve different relative emphasis on examinations and on teachers' subjective judgment. In this way, the authors clarify the ways that embodied and objectified cultural capital exert effects on educational outcomes.	2	Yoko Yamamoto; Mary C. Brinton

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	5	In medical clinic visits, patients do more than convey information about their symptoms and problems so doctors can diagnose and treat them. Patients may also show how they have made sense of their health problems and may press doctors to interpret their problems in certain ways. Using conversation analysis, we analyse a practice patients use early in the medical visit to show that relatively benign or commonplace interpretations of their symptoms are implausible. In this practice, which we term pre-emptive resistance, patients raise candidate explanations for their symptoms and then report circumstances that undermine these explanations. By raising candidate explanations on their own and providing evidence against them, patients call for doctors to restrict the range of diagnostic hypotheses they might otherwise consider. However, the practice does not compel doctors to transparently indicate whether they will do so. Patients also display their ability to recognise and weigh the evidence for common, easily remedied causes of their symptoms. By presenting evidence against them, they show doctors the relevance of more serious diagnostic interpretations without pressing for them outright.	3	Virginia Teas Gill; Anita Pomerantz; Paul Denvir
Salter, Charlotte. 2010. 'Compliance and Concordance During Domiciliary Medication Review Involving Pharmacists and Older People.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:1 21-36.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	3	Medication review is an advanced service registered pharmacists can now offer patients in the UK. This in-depth study of pharmacist-older patient communication during domiciliary medication review encounters examines how the interactions are constructed by participants and the influence of the compliance paradigm on the interaction. Twenty-nine observed, taped and transcribed consultations were analysed using discourse analysis. Ethnographic-style interviews in the field with pharmacists, follow-up interviews with patients and feedback workshops with pharmacists allowed interpretations to be tested and strengthened. The findings presented here use discourse analysis to look at the task-driven nature of the medication review encounters. The analysis explores the interactional format of three over-lapping phases of the consultations: (i) introductions and agenda setting; (ii) screening and testing patients' ability to comply; and, (iii) investigating over-the-counter medicines. Analysis suggests that a dominant compliance paradigm encourages pharmacist-led encounters with patients failing to engage in the medication review process. Little evidence of two-way reciprocated discussion or concordance was evident. The strategic nature of the discourse of compliance heard in these medication review encounters and its effect on older patients are discussed. The paper concludes with a consideration of the implications for pharmacy practice and policy development.	1	Charlotte Salter

Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:1 37-56.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	11	A common assumption is that women who decline prenatal testing distrust biomedicine and trust embodied/experiential knowledge sources, while women who accept testing trust biomedicine and distrust embodied/experiential sources. Another major assumption about prenatal testing utilisation is that women who are open to abortion will undergo prenatal testing while those who are opposed to abortion will decline testing. Yet, previous research has produced inconsistent findings as to what, if anything, distinguishes women who accept or decline the offer of prenatal diagnosis. Analysing interviews with 147 pregnant women, this paper questions these assumptions about the role of abortion views and pregnant women's relative trust in various knowledge sources on their decisions to accept or decline an amniocentesis offer after a positive result on an initial diagnostic screening. We found that pregnant women's attitudes toward different knowledge sources were equally, if not more, important factors than abortion views in affecting whether individual women accepted or declined amniocentesis. At the same time, our data reveal that the relationship between `expert' and `lay' knowledge sources is often complex and synergistic.	3	Susan Markens; Carole H. Browner; H. Mabel Preloran
Shoveller, Jean, Rod Knight, Joy Johnson, John Oliffe & Shira Goldenberg. 2010. '`not the Swab!' Young Men's Experiences With Sti Testing.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:1 57-73.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	11	In Canada, STI rates are high and rising, especially amongst young men. Meanwhile, the needs of young men regarding STI testing services are poorly understood, as are the socio-cultural and structural factors that influence young men's sexual health-seeking behaviours. To better understand this phenomenon, we draw on interviews with 45 men (ages 15-25) from British Columbia, Canada. Our research reveals how structural forces (e.g. STI testing procedures) interact with socio-cultural factors (e.g. perceptions of masculinities and feminities) to shape young men's experiences with STI testing. STI testing was characterised as both a potentially sexualised experience (e.g. fears of getting an erection during genital examinations), and as a process where young men experience multiple vulnerabilities associated with exposing the male body in clinical service sites. In response, participants drew on dominant ideals of masculinity to reaffirm their predominately hetero-normative gender identities. Despite growing up in an era where sexual health promotion efforts have been undertaken, participants did not feel they had permission to engage in discussions with other men about sexual health issues. Attending to young men's perspectives on STI testing represents a starting point in reforming our approaches to addressing how socio-cultural and structural factors shape these experiences.	5	Jean A.

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	0	Drawing on a research collaboration between a group of medical physicists and social scientists, this paper aims to explore female volunteers' experiences of participating in a project for developing a new breast disease diagnostic technology using an optical imaging system. In order to understand how these women make sense of being a volunteer, we examine the complexities of their experiences in this type of research setting through an empirically-based study involving participant observation and semi-structured interviews with the volunteers. Traditionally, volunteers are constructed as passive research material. In contrast, the women in our study are by no means docile bodies - but are active in deploying strategies that create opportunities to exert a level of control over perceived threats within the research encounter. We examine how volunteers translate these threats into `boundaries' about what is and is not acceptable or permissible within this environment, paying particular attention to boundary setting around participation, and invasions of the body (such as pain, touch and exposure, and physical safety), and exploring the strategies volunteers draw on to counter perceived threats to their bodies.	2	Victoria Armstrong; Norma Morris

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	6	Macro-analyses on the regulation of new biomedical objects tend to focus on discursive structures and legislative categories in science policy debates at national and cross-national levels, but overlook how actors engage in regulatory practices on an everyday basis. Based on data from ethnographic fieldwork in British and German clinics, and 32 interviews with medical staff, this article provides an insight into the regulation of adult stem cell research and its clinical implementation. The argument illustrates the enactment of regulation at different stages and highlights the accompanying interpretative strategies employed by the medical personnel involved in the management of clinical trials using patients' own (autologous) stem cells to regenerate damaged cardiac tissue. We argue that the implementation of regulation is a practical accomplishment in both national contexts. The complexities present in this process are instanced by the gradual crystallisation of practices within the organisation of clinical trials. This crystallisation is dependent on exchanges between members of medical teams and external agencies, and is set within a strategic ordering of regulatory measures that are mobilised to legitimise clinical research and reinforce professional interests.	3	Dana M.

Polich, Ginger, Christopher Dole & Ted Kaptchuk. 2010. 'the Need to Act a Little More `scientific': Biomedical Researchers Investigating Complementary and Alternative Medicine.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:1 106-122.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	8	The advent of scientific research on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) has contributed to the current state of flux regarding the distinction between biomedicine and CAM. CAM research scientists play a unique role in reconfiguring this boundary by virtue of their training in biomedical sciences on the one hand and knowledge of CAM on the other. This study uses qualitative interviews to explore how CAM researchers perceive and negotiate challenges inherent in their work. Our analysis considers eight NIH-funded CAM researchers': (1) personal engagement with CAM, (2) social reactions towards perceived suspiciousness of research colleagues and (3) strategic methodological efforts to counteract perceived biases encountered during the peer review process. In response to peer suspicion, interviews showed CAM researchers adjusting their self-presentation style, highlighting their proximity to science, and carefully `self-censoring' or reframing their unconventional beliefs. Because of what was experienced as peer reviewer bias, interviews showed CAM researchers making conciliatory efforts to adopt heightened methodological stringency. As CAM researchers navigate a broadening of biomedicine's boundaries, while still needing to maintain the identity and research methods of a biomedical scientist, this article explores the constant pressure on CAM researchers to appear and act a little more `scientific'.	3	Ginger Polich; Christopher Dole; Ted J.

'How Medical Specialists Appraise Three Controversial Health Innovations: Scientific, Clinical and Social Arguments.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:1 123-139.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	5	Medical specialists play a pivotal role in health innovation evaluation and policy making. Their influence derives not only from their expertise, but also from their social status and the power of their professional organisations. Little is known, however, about how medical specialists determine what makes a health innovation desirable and why. Our qualitative study investigated the views of 28 medical specialists and experts from Quebec and Ontario (Canada) on three controversial innovations: electroconvulsive therapy, prostate-specific antigen screening and prenatal screening for Down's syndrome. Our findings indicate that the scientific, clinical and social arguments of medical specialists combine to create a relatively consistent narrative for each innovation. Our comparative analysis suggests that these narratives bring about a `soft' resolution to controversies, which relies on a more or less tacit understanding of the social desirability of innovations and which sets the stage for their routinisation. Such an unpacking of medical specialists' arguments both for and against new technologies is needed because such arguments may easily be considered authoritative and because there are few forums for debating the social desirability of innovations not generally deemed to be highly controversial.	5	Pascale Lehoux; Jean-Louis Denis; Melanie Rock; Myriam Hivon; Stephanie Tailliez
Greil, Arthur, Kathleen Slauson-Blevins & Julia McQuillan. 2010. 'the Experience of Infertility: a Review of Recent Literature.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:1 140-162.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	41	About 10 years ago Greil published a review and critique of the literature on the socio-psychological impact of infertility. He found at the time that most scholars treated infertility as a medical condition with psychological consequences rather than as a socially constructed reality. This article examines research published since the last review. More studies now place infertility within larger social contexts and social scientific frameworks although clinical emphases persist. Methodological problems remain but important improvements are also evident. We identify two vigorous research traditions in the social scientific study of infertility. One tradition uses primarily quantitative techniques to study clinic patients in order to improve service delivery and to assess the need for psychological counselling. The other tradition uses primarily qualitative research to capture the experiences of infertile people in a sociocultural context. We conclude that more attention is now being paid to the ways in which the experience of infertility is shaped by social context. We call for continued progress in the development of a distinctly sociological approach to infertility and for the continued integration of the two research traditions identified here.	3	Arthur L.

In his paradigm for the examination of racialized identity formation, psychologist William Cross offers a Nigrescence Model with a four-stage approach to understand the development of Black racial identity. Cross' model has been modified to assess other aspects of identity formation such as gender consciousness. My story illuminates how the convergence of these theories offers a new lens through which to view the maturation of raced and gendered subjectivities.

This authoethnography revolves around an epiphanic moment resulting from the impact of years of involvement in this system.

Writing historical references into a play/performance puts oil into motion, reminding us of the dynamic struggle to ``discover'' it in the nineteenth century. This play shows that oil was not so easily digested into modern, industrial life. New rules, norms, and practices came into being that helped early oil users cope with such a messy and explosive substance. Perhaps this oil story will contribute to our collective re-thinking about the many ways we perform oil everyday.	1	Daniel Lord

Through an ethnography of Melbourne's grindcore death-metal scene, I examine how belonging in a music scene is constituted by scene members' affective encounters. In particular, I suggest that a ``brutal'' disposition is necessary for cultivating the affective intensities necessary for experiencing belonging in the scene. Using scene members own understandings of ``brutal'' I shift from iconic representations of ``brutality,'' common in other metal scenes, toward a brutal affect. Here, brutality is experienced as a set of embodied intensities, difficult to articulate, but crucial to understanding how scene members cultivate belonging in the grindcore scene, and in scenic spaces.	1	Rosemary Overell
Hutcherson, Ben & Ross Haenfler. 2010. 'Musical Genre as a Gendered Process: Authenticity in Extreme Metal.' Studies in Symbolic Interaction. 35:1 101-121.	Studies in Symbolic Interaction	2010	0	While authenticity, gender, and genre have all been studied in relation to music, the links between the three are underdeveloped theoretically. Specifically, the ongoing gendered process of constructing authenticity and the role of gendered authenticity in the creation and articulation of new musical genres remain fairly unexplored. In particular, more work is necessary to explain the role of gender in the emergence of new subgenres, in the ongoing maintenance of genre boundaries, and in fans' identity work as they construct ``authentic'' participation in ``underground'' scenes. In this paper, we examine genre as a gendered process in the Extreme Metal (EM) music scene, a popular subgenre of heavy metal. We explore several gendered dimensions of the EM genre, including the music (instrumentation, vocal style, lyrics, record covers, merchandise), live performance ( gender distribution and arrangement, moshing/dancing, audience/crowd interaction), and embodied genre performance (fashion, hair style, makeup). We conclude by suggesting that the construction of new subgenres is, in part, a process of reestablishing and valorizing masculine traits, denigrating feminine traits, and connecting such traits to authenticity, thereby perpetuating gender inequality and hegemonic masculinities.	2	Ben Hutcherson; Ross Haenfler

In so doing, they introduce novelty, unpredictability and creativity in their spontaneous interactions with other musicians. In order to discuss this emergence, a notion of signs in musical communications as indexes, in the Peircean sense, is developed. To produce emergence in the ongoing development of a jam session performance, musicians must produce signs that index new directions that jazz playing can take, such as different rhythmic or harmonic accompaniments, or changes to the volume at which individuals play their instruments.	1	Nick Dempsey

I examine one relationship crucial to the virtuoso's career: the close-knit relationship between teacher and student, and the effect each one has on the career of the other. I define this process as ``career coupling,'' where those involved build their careers together. I base this analysis on ethnographic research of the careers of elite musicians.	1	Izabela Wagner

I show how sonic practices are involved in the formation of the collaborative networks that undergird art worlds.

I show how the study abroad program focused on the conceptual, methodological, and substantive significance of music practices in everyday life. I also show how including the special issue of Symbolic Interaction with more general scholarship on music, culture, and society, allowed students and me to share an in-depth, collaborative focus on interactionism that would not be so easily achieved in a normal classroom setting.

Mississippi Delta blues performers' use of myth serves as the historical example, and this analysis shows how the group reacted to living in a segregated and racist society. Analysis of songs demonstrates how myth can play a role in tying together this subordinated group in society and perpetuate myth. How the blues subculture still employs these myths today is also addressed.	1	William F. Danaher

Studies in Symbolic Interaction	2010	0	Extensive ethnographic research with wives of professional athletes revealed that in certain sport families, the mother-in-law/daughter-in-law relationship is among the numerous unique marital and occupational stressors these wives confront in their everyday life. Many wives believe they must compete with their mothers-in-law for their husbands' attention, love, and support. This chapter makes a case for their use of the intersecting and complementary processes of ``control management'' and emotion management, which involve a variety of interactional strategies, in maintaining these relationships. Although these self-management processes tend to further entrench the wives in the subordinate status to which they are relegated in this male-dominated occupational world, they learn to skillfully use these processes as they struggle to preserve their marriages, support their husbands' careers, and maintain a well-defined sense of self.	1	Steven M.

The futureless past is distinct from several other familiar conceptualizations, including symbolic reconstruction, anomie, and nostalgia. Specifically, the futureless past represents acknowledgment of prior significance and the co-acknowledgment that whatever has occurred cannot possibly occur again. Drawing upon films such as The Days of Wine and Roses and No Country for Old Men, the paper explores the notion of moving forward in time with recollections of things that have passed, using such passage as boundaries between what should and must occur and what can never occur in order to project or deny a shared future.	1	Michael A.

Interview data from families on their interaction with police, funeral home directors, and other institutional officials suggest that the construction of postmortem identities is commonly a process of contestation filled with competing identity-claims. The findings reveal that as families resist ``oppressive othering'' by the state and other institutional actors, they develop various accounts and strategies in ``selfing'' and sanctifying the identity of the dead.	1	Daniel D.

Symbolic Interaction	2010	0	Women who have abortions are caught in the crossfire of a heated ideological battle. The prochoice contention is that most women feel relieved after terminating an unwanted pregnancy. The antiabortion camp asserts killing an unborn child psychologically scars the mother. Drawing on in-depth interviews with forty women who have terminated a pregnancy, this study examines how the clashing emotion culture of abortion politics shapes women's feelings about abortion. Findings indicate that women use behavioral and cognitive techniques in an attempt to transform unpleasant physiological reactions, inappropriate expressive gestures, and problematic emotional labels. As they run the gauntlet, women also strategically dodge or deliberately approach hazardous situational cues (e.g., abortion debate rhetoric and demonstrators, pictures of fetal development and the ultrasound, and babies and pregnant women) to achieve a feeling state that is consistent with their ideology.	1	Jennifer Keys
Doering, Jan. 2010. 'Face, Accounts, and Schemes in the Context of Relationship Breakups.' Symbolic Interaction. 33:1 71-95.	Symbolic Interaction	2010	1	This article investigates account strategies that individuals employ to neutralize identity threats caused by breakups from romantic relationships. I distinguish three narrative frames for such accounts: dumper, dumpee, and consensus narratives. Individuals who employ a consensus narrative frame provide accounts by default: they deny that any harm was done to anyone. Dumpers dismissed the breakup's conflictuality, used externalization strategies, and depicted themselves as empathetic. Dumpees used externalization strategies and denials of injury, emphasized their agency, and pointed out valuable changes of self. I then analyze the results from a phenomenological perspective to identify connections between accounting practices and the structure of the self. I argue that accounting for traumatic breakups is important for the development of schemes that guide perception, action, and the interpretation of biography.	1	Jan Doering
Borer, Michael. 2010. 'From Collective Memory to Collective Imagination: Time, Place, and Urban Redevelopment.' Symbolic Interaction. 33:1 96-114.	Symbolic Interaction	2010	2	This article is about a place that does not exist, yet. It is about residents' perceptions of redevelopment plans involving the reconstruction of a defunct neighborhood firehouse. Interviews revealed the residents' ``collective imagination'' as they actively envisioned potential future outcomes for a firehouse-turned-community center. When asked about the needs of the community, interviewees discussed the current conditions of their neighborhood (the present), its history (the past), and how they would like to see it change (the future). This corresponds well with George Herbert Mead's ideas about temporality. I argue that connecting the identity of a place to a sociological understanding of time (especially Mead's) is a necessary step for gaining a better understanding of the subjective side of urbanization and ultimately creating a better vernacular knowledge base for urban redevelopment plans.	1	Michael Ian Borer
Daub, Shannon. 2010. 'Negotiating Sustainability: Climate Change Framing in the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union.' Symbolic Interaction. 33:1 115-140.	Symbolic Interaction	2010	1	Environmental problems are often reduced to a catch-22 that portrays sustainability-oriented policies as disastrous for resource sector workers. Despite efforts by many industry leaders to frame climate change in ``jobs versus environment'' terms, the Communications, Energy and Paperworkers Union of Canada (CEP) has supported ambitious greenhouse gas reduction policies. Using interviews with union members and staff, this study examines CEP's climate change framing. It finds that CEP extended the environmental justice master frame to define its response to climate change, neutralize anti-Kyoto rhetoric, and work with the environmental movement. CEP's framing was accomplished through negotiation processes that continue to unfold as members work out the union's positions relative to their own values, experiences, and interpretations of what is possible. These findings suggest sustainability can be understood as an emergent, localized, and contested social order, and point to ``self-negotiation'' in longer-term social change struggles as a potential area of further study.	1	Shannon J.

Teaching Sociology	2010	4	Among the common requirements for receipt of a degree in the social sciences is the completion of a senior seminar in which a senior thesis or capstone project is produced. A number of educational goals have been proposed for this requirement: integrating the knowledge base supplied by the regular curriculum, contributing to students' future roles as informed citizens, and preparing for study in graduate programs, among others. However, few studies have empirically explored the substance of the senior seminars and capstones offered across a discipline or studied their organization, requirements, and pedagogy.

Mollborn, Stefanie & Angel Hoekstra. 2010. '``a Meeting of Minds'': Using Clickers for Critical Thinking and Discussion in Large Sociology Classes.' Teaching Sociology. 38:1 18-27.	Teaching Sociology	2010	12	Because lecture-based teaching limits student learning, many instructors are interested in pedagogical strategies that support critical thinking, student participation, and group discussion in large classrooms. Audience response systems, or ``clickers,'' are an emerging tool for addressing this problem, but predominant pedagogical models for clicker use developed in the natural sciences often do not encourage the ``inquiry-guided learning'' that is useful in sociology. This article introduces readers to clicker technology and outlines a new pedagogical model for clicker use designed to address sociological learning goals, including critical thinking, applications of concepts to real-life experiences, and critiques of sociological methods. The authors discuss the effects of clickers for classroom interaction and students' experiences in three undergraduate sociology courses, using quantitative and qualitative data about students' perceptions of the effects of this pedagogical model on learning. The results suggest that the model positively affects participation, critical thinking, and classroom interaction dynamics. The authors conclude with practical suggestions for instructors considering implementing clickers; in sociology courses.	2	Stefanie Mollborn; Angel Hoekstra

The author has found interteaching to be an effective organizational and instructional approach for introductory-level sociology courses.

Teaching Sociology	2010	0	Recently, a growing contingent of ``evolutionary sociologists'' has begun to integrate theoretical ideas and empirical findings derived from evolutionary biology, especially sociobiology, into a variety of sociological inquiries. Without capitulating to a naive version of either biological reductionism or genetic determinism, these researchers and theorists have begun to synthesize sociological thought with research produced in various branches of the evolutionary life sciences. These recent developments provide sociology instructors with new opportunities to reconsider how they address the topic of biology's relevance to sociology.

Current Perspectives in Social Theory	2010	0	I propose a theoretical framework that specifies dynamic principles involving the generalized and ubiquitous everyday interaction of society and state actors alternately in upholding and undermining the rules that spell the unequal distribution of power and resources. The framework proposed brings together a historically specific micro-process - contention with a general macro-principle of permanence and change in the distributive rules - the creation, renegotiation, and occasional destruction of a generally durable yet continuously contested ``pact of domination.'' Inequality represents simultaneously a central organizing principle of social life and a recurring source of conflict over rights and rules, the latter being the practical rules that govern interaction in specific cases of contention, giving governing agencies the necessary flexibility to act casuistically, giving in here, and throwing its weight there, with new formal rules sometimes following that process, or old ones falling in disuse. In this scheme, the state is a historically created organizational and coercive agent embodying and enforcing the currently valid pact, mostly through legal/coercive, but also ideological power over its territory of jurisdiction. State forms are specific to each historically constructed pact of domination, so that there is no such thing as a state in general, but a series of historically constructed states, each with its rules of ``who should get what'' and peculiar ways of maintaining inequality between dominant and dominated.	1	Viviane Brachet-Marquez

Current Perspectives in Social Theory	2010	0	George Ritzer (2010) recently conceptualized globalization in terms of liquidity and, especially, flows. This conceptualization is largely rooted in Zygmunt Bauman's theory of a world dominated by increasing liquidity. However, neither Bauman nor Ritzer put these ideas in the context of their intellectual genealogy. This essay seeks to do that by reviewing the surprisingly rich history of thought pertaining to these ideas, especially flows. Through this review we also hope to call attention to some long-debated philosophical questions that inform how a theory of flows (and structures) can be applied to our contemporary globalized world.	2	P.

Smith, Robert. 2010. 'Why Nazified Germans Killed Jewish People: Insights From Agent-based Modeling of Genocidal Actions.' Current Perspectives in Social Theory. 27:1 275-342.	Current Perspectives in Social Theory	2010	2	This chapter explicates the logic of a computational agent-based model bearing on the willingness of perpetrator agents to conduct genocidal actions against Jewish people during World War II. Given realistic distributions of benefits and costs and sufficient time, as a joint consequence of these distributions and interpersonal influence the model readily creates agents who are avowed anti-Semites, Nazis, and perpetrators of the genocide, even transforming agents characterized initially by lower levels of anti-Semitism. Although many agents initially exhibit dissonance (i.e., a disjunction) between their attitudes and choices, toward the end of this period their anti-Semitic attitudes and choices become consonant (i.e., internally consistent). Experiments and parameter studies using this model indicate that different distributions of benefits and costs, changed legitimacy of authority, and different values of anti-Semitism of influential agents can modify the growth of prejudice, Nazism, and genocidal choices in these random-number-based Monte Carlo trials. The results clarify the conflicting interpretations of Goldhagen and Browning concerning the genocidal actions of a battalion of perpetrators and the role of propaganda in reducing moral costs. Six hypotheses that focus the testing of the model can be generalized creating insights about other genocides.	1	Robert B. Smith
Gartman, David. 2010. 'Economy and Field in the Rise of Postmodern Architecture.' Current Perspectives in Social Theory. 27:1 343-374.	Current Perspectives in Social Theory	2010	0	Sociologists studying the rise of postmodernism have generally concentrated on either macro-level structures of economy or micro-level subjectivities of individuals. Few have specified how meso-level actions within concrete institutions have produced both these macro- and micro-changes. Bourdieu's concept of field provides a meso-level concept that allows sociologists to explain the transition to a postmodern society by changes in the composition and competition of producers and consumers struggling for advantage in the economy and culture. The chapter focuses on architecture, revealing that the rise of a postmodern aesthetic was the result of internal changes of this field and their complex interrelation with the external changes of an economy in transition from Fordism to post-Fordism.	1	David Gartman
Haydu, Jeffrey. 2010. 'Reversals of Fortune: Path Dependency, Problem Solving, and Temporal Cases.' Theory and Society. 39:1 25-48.	Theory and Society	2010	6	Historical reversals highlight a basic methodological problem: is it possible to treat two successive periods both as independent cases to compare for causal analysis and as parts of a single historical sequence? I argue that one strategy for doing so, using models of path dependency, imposes serious limits on explanation. An alternative model which treats successive periods as contrasting solutions for recurrent problems offers two advantages. First, it more effectively combines analytical comparisons of different periods with narratives of causal sequences spanning two or more periods. Second, it better integrates scholarly accounts of historical reversals with actors' own narratives of the past.	1	Jeffrey Haydu
Tavory, Iddo. 2010. 'of Yarmulkes and Categories: Delegating Boundaries and the Phenomenology of Interactional Expectation.' Theory and Society. 39:1 49-68.	Theory and Society	2010	6	Based on ethnographic fieldwork and interviews, this article delineates a process through which members of an Orthodox Jewish neighborhood in Los Angeles unintentionally delegate boundary work and membership-identification to anonymous others in everyday life. Living in the midst of a non-Jewish world, orthodox men are often approached by others, both Jews and non-Jews, who categorize them as ``religious Jews'' based on external marks such as the yarmulke and attire. These interactions, varying from mundane interactions to anti-Semitic incidents, are then tacitly anticipated by members even when they are not attending to their ``Jewishness''aEuro''when being a ``Jew'' is interactionally invisible. Through this case, I argue that, in addition to conceptualizing boundaries and identifications as either emerging in performance or institutionally given and stable, the study of boundaries should also chart the sites in which members anticipate categorization and the way these anticipations play out in everyday life.	1	Iddo Tavory

Theory and Society	2010	0	Focusing on Alexandre Millerand's reform of the French factory inspectorate, this article highlights the dilemmas of mezzo-level administrative leadership and policy reform in states that have strong administrative capacity, but low public trust and weak associational life. Building on the insights of theories of political and bureaucratic entrepreneurship derived from studies of American political development, the article challenges their taken-for-granted assumptions and comparative applicability, and demonstrates the explanatory potential of the older sociological institutionalism exemplified in the work of Philip Selznick. In particular, the article highlights the unintended consequences of the formal and informal cooptation of targeted social groups for the reputational autonomy of administrative leaders, the (re)definition of institutional mission, and organizational success or failure.	1	Frieda Fuchs

These unorthodox views are explored against the assessments found in Hugh Brogan's latest biography of the nineteenth century, social and political theorist.	2	John Stone; Xiaoshuo Hou
Campbell, Alec. 2010. 'the Sociopolitical Origins of the American Legion.' Theory and Society. 39:1 1-24.	Theory and Society	2010	0	The American Legion was one of the most politically consequential organizations in the twentieth-century United States. It was a local bedrock of anti-communism in two post-war red scares and throughout the cold war. It also built a lavish and cross-nationally unique welfare state for American veterans. In this article, I examine the origins of the American Legion and demonstrate that it was organized by rentier capitalists acting in their intraclass and interclass interests. Most importantly, the Legion was an organization that fought the ``battle over class'' by denying the importance of class as a social concept and proposing ``Americanism'' as an alternative. I also argue that the Legion's extreme anti-communism combined with its dedication to welfare provision for American veterans altered the course of American welfare state development.	1	Alec Campbell
Taylor, Verta, Katrina Kimport, Nella Van & Ellen Andersen. 2009. 'Culture and Mobilization: Tactical Repertoires, Same-sex Weddings, and the Impact on Gay Activism.' American Sociological Review. 74:6 865-890.	American Sociological Review	2009	20	Social movement scholars have long been skeptical of culture impact on political change, perhaps for good reason, since little empirical research explicitly addresses this question. This article fills the void by examining the dynamics and the impact of the month-long 2004 same-sex wedding protest in San Francisco. We integrate insights of contentious politics approaches with social constructionist conceptions and identify three core features of cultural repertoires: contestation, intentionality, and collective identity. Our analyses, which draw on rich qualitative and quantitative data from interviews with participants and movement leaders and a random survey of participants, highlight these dimensions of cultural repertoires as well as the impact that the same-sex wedding protest had on subsequent activism. Same-sex weddings, as our multimethod analyses show, were an intentional episode of claim-making, with participants arriving with a history of activism in a variety of other social movements. Moreover relative to the question of impact, the initial protest sparked other forms of political action that ignited a statewide campaign for marriage equality in California. Our results offer powerful evidence that culture can be consequential not only internally, with implications for participant solidarity and identity, but for political change and further action as well. We conclude by discussing the specifics of our case and the broader implications for social movement scholars.	4	Verta Taylor; Katrina Kimport; Nella Van; Ellen Ann Andersen

American Sociological Review	2009	12	From 2000 through 2008, initiatives proposing to ban same-sex marriage were on the ballot in 28 states. Although same-sex marriage opponents scored lopsided victories in most cases, voting outcomes varied substantially at the county level. This article examines sources of that variation and argues that opposition to same-sex marriage should be strong in communities characterized by the predominance of traditional gender roles and family structure. Perhaps more interestingly the analysis also shows that the effects of traditional family structure and gender roles are especially strong in counties characterized by weak community cohesion, as indicated by residential instability, low rates of home ownership, and high crime rates.	2	Rory McVeigh; Maria-Elena D.

Rosenfeld, Jake & Meredith Kleykamp. 2009. 'Hispanics and Organized Labor in the United States, 1973 to 2007.' American Sociological Review. 74:6 916-937.	American Sociological Review	2009	3	Prior research finds that minority populations in the United States secure union employment as part of the process of economic incorporation. Yet little work systematically tests whether this pattern holds for the nation largest minority, Hispanics, during recent decades of union decline. After juxtaposing traditional labor market position theories of unionization with solidaristic accounts, we use 1973 to 2007 Current Population Survey (CPS) data to provide the most comprehensive analysis of Hispanics and organized labor in the United States to date. We disaggregate the Hispanic population by citizenship, nationality, and time since arrival to uncover subpopulation differences in the odds of union membership. Additional analyses take advantage of the CPS structure to target individuals who join a union, allowing its to test whether organized labor much-publicized efforts to incorporate recent immigrants have resulted in detectable gains. Consistent with solidaristic accounts of labor organization, results suggest that certain Hispanic subpopulations-especially those born in the United States and immigrants who have secured citizenship-have higher unionization odds and join unions at higher rates than do US.-born whites, even after controlling for traditional positional accounts of labor organization. However, the large substantive effects of positional variables, such as sector, occupation, and firm size, indicate that organized labor revival depends on more than any one group capacity for collective action.	2	Jake Rosenfeld; Meredith Kleykamp
Isaac, Larry. 2009. 'Movements, Aesthetics, and Markets in Literary Change: Making the American Labor Problem Novel.' American Sociological Review. 74:6 938-965.	American Sociological Review	2009	5	One path to cultural innovation in artistic and literary fields is differentiation of a genre into new subgenres. But what are the dynamics at work in such a process? This article addresses that question by identifying and explaining the emergence and trajectory of a new fiction subgenre-the American labor problem novel-during the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries. I make a theoretical case for the intersection of social movement fields and cultural production fields showing, through a historical sociological analysis, that this subgenre was the joint product of: (1) a shift in literary aesthetic practice resulting from the rise of realism, (2) the subgenre dialogical character (3) collective contention surrounding the rise of labor movement militancy, and (4) the exigencies of literary and popular culture markets. The historical conjuncture of these processes contributed to a repository of cultural constructions of class in storied form, as novelists sought to both entertain and educate readers about the emerging realities of class-contentious industrial society. This study demonstrates the fruitfulness of merging sociology of culture theory and social movement outcome perspectives when analyzing cultural change.	1	Larry Isaac

American Sociological Review. 74:6 966-988.	American Sociological Review	2009	34	Using data from a 2005 survey of U.S. workers, we find that a high percentage of employed men and women report that work interferes with nonwork life. This research offers three main contributions: (1) we document the social distribution of work-nonwork interference across social statuses and dimensions of stratification; (2) we develop a conceptual framework that specifies the influence of a comprehensive set of work resources and demands on interference and their contributions to its social distribution; and (3) we advance a ``stress of higher status'' perspective to understand the paradoxical influence of some work conditions on work-nonwork interference. Findings generally support both the demands hypothesis and the stress of higher status hypothesis, with patterns from both factors contributing substantially to the social distribution of work-nonwork interference. This article refines and elaborates the job demands-resources model with insights from border theory.	3	Scott Schieman; Melissa A. Milkie; Paul Glavin
Maume, David, Rachel Sebastian & Anthony Bardo. 2009. 'Gender Differences in Sleep Disruption Among Retail Food Workers.' American Sociological Review. 74:6 989-1007.	American Sociological Review	2009	4	As women pursue careers while retaining primary responsibility for family life, discretionary time is an emerging arena of gender inequality in contemporary life. This study examines gender inequality in waking role obligations and the implications for differences in sleep disruption. Drawing on a sample of 583 retail food workers, who regularly worked nights and rotating schedules, we find in our multivariate modeling that women experience significantly more sleep disruption than do men. A decomposition analysis shows that almost one-half of the gender gap in sleep disruption is accounted for by gender differences in health status and various dimensions of work-family context. By implication, the remainder of the gender gap in sleep disruption is attributable to differences in responsibility for work-family obligations. Given the need for more research on how work-family conflict affects health and well-being, further research on sleep patterns is warranted.	3	David J. Maume; Rachel A. Sebastian; Anthony R. Bardo
Orum, Anthony, Sidney Bata, Li Shumei, Tang Jiewei, Sang Yang & Nguyen Trung. 2009. 'Public Man and Public Space in Shanghai Today.' City \& Community. 8:4 369-389.	City \& Community	2009	0	Public space is a topic of great interest for urban scholars and urban planners. Such space, like parks, sidewalks, and plazas, it is argued, can provide the common grounds where the inhabitants of a city meet, exchange ideas, even engage in a variety of cultural performances. This article reports on fieldwork about the use of public space in Shanghai today. We find a great diversity of uses, ranging from vendors who sell their wares to people who engage in heated and extensive political discussions to performers of Beijing opera and ballroom dancing. We also find that the local authorities use a light, and sometimes covert, hand in their oversight of inhabitants in such spaces. Finally, we discover that powerful social differences and inequalities between native inhabitants and working-class migrants, which have emerged during the period of economic reform and market transition, are now actively in evidence in the quality and use of public space in Shanghai. The article puts these findings within a broader theoretical context, concluding in the end that for many-though not all-inhabitants public man is alive and well in Shanghai.	6	Anthony M.

Anjaria, Jonathan. 2009. 'Guardians of the Bourgeois City: Citizenship, Public Space, and Middle-class Activism in Mumbai.' City \& Community. 8:4 391-406.	City \& Community	2009	10	This article examines the new phenomenon of ``citizens' groups'' in contemporary Mumbai, India, whose activities are directed at making the city's public spaces more orderly. Recent scholarship on Mumbai's efforts to become a ``global'' city has pointed to the removal of poor populations as an instance of neoliberal governmentality as espoused by the Indian state following the ``liberalization'' of the economy in the early 1990s. However, in this case, it is these civil society organizations, not the state-whose functionaries in fact benefit from a certain element of unruliness on the streets-who are the agents of increased control over populations and of the rationalization of urban space. This article, based on fieldwork-based research, argues that the way in which citizens' groups exclude poor populations from the city is more complex than a straightforward deployment of neoliberalism, and is imbricated with transnational political economic arrangements in uneven and often inconsistent ways. In particular, this article explores how civic activists in these organizations envision their role in the city, and how their activism attempts to reconfigure the nature of citizenship. For instance, civic activists consider themselves to be the stewards of the city's streets and sidewalks, and wage their battles against what they consider unruly hawkers, a corrupt state, and a complacent middle-class public. Moreover, civic activists render street hawkers' political claims illegitimate by speaking on behalf of the abstract ``citizen''of Mumbai, thus implying that hawkers' unions speak only on behalf of the vested interests of a single population. In this way, they mobilize a normative notion of civil society in order to exclude the vast segment of city residents who either sell or buy goods on the street. In doing so, the civic activists transform the discourse and practice of politics in the city, so that, ironically, while on one hand using the rhetoric of citizen participation, they in fact undermine the radically heterogeneous forms of democratic political participation the city offers.	1	Jonathan Shapiro Anjaria
Weinstein, Liza & Xuefei Ren. 2009. 'the Changing Right to the City: Urban Renewal and Housing Rights in Globalizing Shanghai and Mumbai.' City \& Community. 8:4 407-432.	City \& Community	2009	9	This article examines the changing housing rights regimes amidst the urban renewal currently underway in Shanghai and Mumbai. We examine the policies and regulations that govern residential security and housing tenure, the alteration of policy implementations by electoral and extra-electoral contestations, and the opportunities and strategies for housing activism in each context. We find that political contestations have enabled the construction of a more protective, although precarious, regime in Mumbai than in Shanghai. Despite striking differences, in both contexts housing rights regimes have produced fragmented urban citizenship rights by distributing protections unevenly and inconsistently to urban residents. Finally, although the forms of housing activism differ, residents and civil society groups in both Shanghai and Mumbai employ a variety of strategies in their resistance against demolitions and urban renewal. In the process, they become active urban citizens by articulating their rights to housing and by making new claims to the city.	2	Liza Weinstein; Xuefei Ren
Chen, Xiangming, Lan Wang & Ratoola Kundu. 2009. 'Localizing the Production of Global Cities: a Comparison of New Town Developments Around Shanghai and Kolkata.' City \& Community. 8:4 433-465.	City \& Community	2009	5	This article investigates the role played by the state in the production and management of urban space vis--vis global agents of change. The proliferation of new towns and special economic zones as urban restructuring strategies in rapidly developing countries like China and India are receiving much attention from the scholarly community, documenting and interrogating urban transitions from centralized planning to more participatory and often privatized modes of decentralized planning. This article seeks to tease out the kinds of relationships between the state and other urban development actors it entails, ranging from conflict to collaboration, from protest to partnerships, and from contestation to collaboration. In the Shanghai Metropolitan context, we focus on Anting New Town and Songjiang New City as two cases for understanding the relative power of the municipal government, global capital, professional planning, and the limited influence of local residents in the process and outcome of large-scale suburban development. As a comparison, we focus on the West Bengal State government's role in the development of two new townships (Rajarhat New Town and the Kolkata West International City) on the fringes of the existing core city of Kolkata (Calcutta), India. Drawing on a number of secondary sources such as development plans, newspaper articles, field-based observations, and informal discussions and interviews with official town planners, architects, and private planners, our goal is to compare and contrast the two strategies foregrounding the practices and the relationship of the state to the forces of privatization and globalization, to local grassroots actors and the precarious as well as multifarious ways in which it seeks to constantly negotiate with the dynamics of development. It seeks to answer: what kind of challenges does the state face in reorganizing the urban ? Who are the other actors involved in the negotiations and exclusions, contestations, and collaborations ? What are the new sociospatial, economic, and political boundaries and contents of the spaces produced ?.	3	Xiangming Chen; Lan Wang; Ratoola Kundu
Short, James & Lorine Hughes. 2009. 'Urban Ethnography and Research Integrity Empirical and Theoretical Dimensions.' Ethnography. 10:4 397-415.	Ethnography	2009	0	Problems of data reliability and validity continue to plague the social and behavioral sciences. Enhanced reliability of quantitative data has been achieved by such means as greater attention to instrument construction and testing, improvements in survey technology and sampling of targeted populations, and careful operationalization of theoretical ideas. The integrity of much quantitative research is compromised, however, when quantitative measures lack validity, especially when properties of groups and other collectivities are measured by responses obtained from individuals. Ethnographic and other forms of observational data offer important correctives to this problem. We illustrate the interplay of quantitative and qualitative research methods by examining studies extending ideas from Elijah Anderson's Code of the Street to `neighborhood codes of violence', the violence-avoiding function of street codes, and special problems of evaluation research as they apply to programs designed to control street gangs.	2	James F.

Duck, Waverly. 2009. '`senseless' Violence Making Sense of Murder.' Ethnography. 10:4 417-434.	Ethnography	2009	0	This article, based on an ethnographic study conducted over a three-year period in an impoverished, predominately African American and Latino neighborhood in the northeastern US, describes how a drug gang narrative was created by the police and prosecutors to explain a series of unsolved murders. The narrative that the authorities constructed retroactively tied these unrelated crimes together by connecting them to neighborhood drug dealers whom they construed as a gang. Through this narrative, the authorities were able to prosecute all the cases in sequence and deploy a series of defendants and witnesses to win convictions - even in cases where they had little evidence. Murders like these are typically described by law enforcement agencies and the media as `senseless' acts of `random violence'. When examined with ethnographic detail, however, these acts of murder turn out to have motives that community members understand but have nothing to do with gang activity.	1	Waverly Duck
Jerolmack, Colin. 2009. 'Primary Groups and Cosmopolitan Ties the Rooftop Pigeon Flyers of New York City.' Ethnography. 10:4 435-457.	Ethnography	2009	3	This article examines a group of working-class men who breed and fly pigeons from their rooftops in New York City. It explores how the flyers experience their neighborhoods through their animal practices and shows how ethnic whites transmitted this practice to non-whites. It also documents their gatherings at a pet shop, where the flyers campaign for status based on their birds' performance. These men form a distinct collective that is strongly rooted in their solitary animal practices but is given meaning largely through social interactions. Most community studies find conflict among different working-class racial-ethnic groups who share urban neighborhoods, but pigeon flying fosters solidarity among Italian, Hispanic, and African American New Yorkers of varying ages. The study highlights how animal practices can organize social relationships and connections to the environment and demonstrates that shared everyday activities can be as vital as ethnicity or class in primary group formation.	1	Colin Jerolmack
Avery, Jacob. 2009. 'Taking Chances the Experience of Gambling Loss.' Ethnography. 10:4 459-474.	Ethnography	2009	2	This article conceives of heavy gambling loss as a phenomenon driven by situational antecedents located in the foreground of the experience itself, rather than being deeply determined by background factors like biological inclinations or psychological pathologies, as the prevalent biomedical model of pathological gambling assumes. Drawing on naturalistic accounts from first-hand observation, this analysis focuses on the internal states of players as they move through distinct stages endemic to gambling, and, specifically, gambling loss. I argue that structuring the experience in this way plays an important role in showing how ethnographic methods that attend to experiential processes and their situational dimensions enable us to reconceptualize what are seen as individual problems or, in this case, pathologies.	1	Jacob Avery

This article draws on four years of ongoing ethnographic fieldwork with inner-city men who rap at Project Blowed, a Hip Hop `open mic' in South Central Los Angeles. While rappers initially view Project Blowed as a place to hone their performance skills and earn the respect of their peers, they hope to move beyond it and make money in the music industry. `OGs', senior rappers, who continue to participate in this scene mentor younger rappers, but may also become examples of the dead-end careers that up-and-coming rappers hope to avoid. This article explores how participants' perceptions of this venue are linked to their changing perceptions of others in the scene.	1	Jooyoung Lee

This article is based on a larger study examining the personal, social, and working lives of undocumented restaurant workers using an ethnographic approach in conjunction with the life history method. Based on observation of their day-to-day interactions in the restaurant and in conversations, this article discusses the `family' or fictive kin relationship they establish with their co-workers and their employer. Despite their illegal status and low earnings, this group of undocumented workers is able to maintain their dignity, find ways of bringing joy to their lives, and attain a sense of belonging. Integration into the restaurant's pseudo-family averts feelings of frustration and loneliness that are often the consequences of marginalization.	1	Esther Chihye Kim

Ethnography	2009	2	Lacking access to legal residency and to regular employment, undocumented Latinos in the USA often find work as day laborers. Some suburban towns have tried to force Latinos out by enacting statutes to restrict their movement and their search for jobs. How do day laborers, who are conspicuous because of their racial-ethnic and language differences, find work by meeting employers in public spaces despite legal restrictions against their presence there? This comparative ethnography of day laborers in Freehold, New Jersey, and Manassas, Virginia, shows that workers engage such tactics as avoiding police and showing deference to white residents while battling for leverage when negotiating wages.	2	Carol Cleaveland; Leo Pierson
Emerson, Robert. 2009. 'Ethnography, Interaction and Ordinary Trouble.' Ethnography. 10:4 535-548.	Ethnography	2009	6	With the increased popularity and spread of sociological ethnography, one of the core elements of classic Chicago-style fieldwork an abiding commitment to examine ongoing social interaction - has sometimes slipped from sight. One fruitful way of increasing sensitivity to and insights into interactional processes is to look at ordinary, small troubles, the often fleeting moments of upset and disruption that arise routinely in many interactions and are often quickly resolved, leading only to small adjustments and changes in life circumstances. By way of example, this article analyzes the ordinary troubles that arise between college roommates, focusing on two distinctive interactional features of these troubles: the obscuring of action components in low-visibility responses, leading to the appearance of passivity or inaction; and the varying and often shifting normative accents that can mark responses to ordinary troubles.	1	Robert M.

Wilson, William & Anmol Chaddha. 2009. 'the Role of Theory in Ethnographic Research.' Ethnography. 10:4 549-564.	Ethnography	2009	4	Scholars, including urban poverty researchers, have not seriously debated the important issues that Loic Wacquant raised in his controversial review of books by Elijah Anderson, Mitchell Duneier, and Katherine Newman concerning the disconnect between theory and ethnographic research. Despite the tone of Wacquant's review, we feel that he made a contribution in raising important issues about the role of theory in ethnography. The responses to his review that address this issue, especially those by Anderson and Duneier, are also important because they help to broaden our understanding of how theory is used in ethnographic research. What we take from this exchange is that good ethnography is theory driven, and is likely to be much more reflective of inductive theoretical insights than those that are purely deductive. Moreover, we show that in some ethnographic studies the theoretical insights are neither strictly deductive nor inductive, but represent a combination of both.	2	William Julius Wilson; Anmol Chaddha

Schmalzbauer, Leah. 2009. 'Gender on a New Frontier Mexican Migration in the Rural Mountain West.' Gender \& Society. 23:6 747-767.	Gender \& Society	2009	5	In this article, the author draws from ethnographic field work with Mexican migrants in southwestern Montana, an emerging rural settlement of the Mountain West, to analyze the ways in which context of reception affects gender relations. The author constructs the analysis by looking at gender in terms of three primary elements of migrant incorporation: (1) employment, (2) geography, and (3) culture. The author finds that in Montana traditional gender relations are typically fortified or reintroduced through the migration process, often to the detriment of women. Yet women remain optimistic about their lives because they believe that in Montana they can be better mothers, providing safety and opportunities for their children that they could not provide elsewhere. The data challenge theorizing from urban settlements and highlight the significance of context of reception for constructions of gender and women's experiences of power.	1	Leah Schmalzbauer
Warren, Sarah. 2009. 'How Will We Recognize Each Other as Mapuche? Gender and Ethnic Identity Performances in Argentina.' Gender \& Society. 23:6 768-789.	Gender \& Society	2009	0	This article builds on the literature of ``doing'' identities through a case study of indigenous Mapuche people in Argentina. Argentina is a unique place to study indigenous identities because they are not rigidly defined by the state or by Argentine society, thus making social interactions more visible. My analysis shows that ``doing'' identities is an inherently intersectional process. Mapuche women engage in gendered interactions to create an authentic indigenous identity, often for the purpose of gaining rights, emphasizing traditional clothing to become ``icons of tradition.'' Yet, their interactions and choices about how and when to use traditional clothing highlight the paradoxical ways tradition works. My analysis suggests that tradition invokes a historical rigidity that constrains women within certain gender expectations, but it also invokes a sense of community wholeness that can empower women to define new ways of ``doing'' gendered indigeneity.	1	Sarah D.

Carpenter, Laura & Monica Casper. 2009. 'a Tale of Two Technologies Hpv Vaccination, Male Circumcision, and Sexual Health.' Gender \& Society. 23:6 790-816.	Gender \& Society	2009	2	This article brings insights from feminist science and technology studies to bear on recent public debates over the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, which prevents many cervical cancers, and male circumcision as potential HIV preventive. In the United States, attempts to mandate HPV vaccination have activated intense concerns about female ``promiscuity,'' whereas talk of promoting circumcision against HIV has triggered scant anxiety about American boys' sexuality. The authors show how intersections among gender, sexuality, race, and age have shaped responses to these two containment technologies-and how the technologies' deployment both relies on and reproduces meanings of gender and sexuality that constitute the omnipresent `` double standard.'' The analysis develops an original feminist sociology of containment, explicating how social relations shape the innovation, reinvention, and use of technologies to contain particular sorts of bodies, fluids, and sexual practices-by whom, under what conditions, and for what purposes.	2	Laura M.

Jacobs, Jerry. 2009. 'Where Credit Is Due Assessing the Visibility of Articles Published in Gender \& Society With Google Scholar.' Gender \& Society. 23:6 817-832.	Gender \& Society	2009	4	Gender \& Society is the leading specialty journal in the sociology of gender, as indicated by its high ranking in the ISI Web of Knowledge Journal Citation Reports. The ISI system, however, does not track citations appearing in books, and thus a significant potential source of references for Gender \& Society is missed. This article reports the results of an analysis of highly cited articles that compares their visibility in Google Scholar to that documented in the ISI data system. Google Scholar captures more than twice as many references to these Gender \& Society articles than does the ISI Web of Knowledge. The analysis shows that the incremental coverage is greater for Gender \& Society than for several other prominent sociology journals. The absolute and relative standing of Gender \& Society would improve if a more comprehensive system of tracking citations were employed.	1	Jerry A. Jacobs
Reitz, Jeffrey, Rupa Banerjee, Mai Phan & Jordan Thompson. 2009. 'Race, Religion, and the Social Integration of New Immigrant Minorities in Canada1.' International Migration Review. 43:4 695-726.	International Migration Review	2009	4	The social integration of Canada's new religious minorities is determined more by their racial minority status than by their religious affiliation or degree of religiosity, according to results from Statistics Canada's 2002 Ethnic Diversity Survey. Interview questions tap life satisfaction, affective ties to Canada, and participation in the wider community. Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Hindus are slower to integrate socially, mainly because they are mostly racial minorities. Degree of religiosity affects social integration in the same ways as ethnic community attachments in general, positively for some dimensions, negatively for others, and similarly for different religious groups. Patterns are similar in Quebec and the rest of Canada; results carry implications for the debate over ``reasonable accommodation'' of religious minorities in Quebec, and parallel debates in other provinces and countries.	4	Jeffrey G.

International Migration Review	2009	4	This article examines how immigrant women's social networks affect their propensity to vote and to participate in unconventional political activities, as well as their knowledge of politics and government services and programs. Our primary source of data is a telephone survey of women living in Canada's two largest metropolitan areas. Our findings show that contrary to the social capital literature, bonding ties do not exert strong negative effects on political incorporation, while bridging ties are not as helpful as hypothesized. What is important for immigrant women are the resources that are embedded in their social networks.	2	Elisabeth Gidengil; Dietlind Stolle
Delano, Alexandra. 2009. 'From Limited to Active Engagement: Mexico's Emigration Policies From a Foreign Policy Perspective (2000-2006).' International Migration Review. 43:4 764-814.	International Migration Review	2009	5	Mexico's emigration policies - including the state's engagement with the diaspora, the discourse in relation to emigrants, the responses to U.S. migration policies and legislation, and the priority given to the issue in the national and bilateral agendas - have undergone a process of transformation since the late 1980s and particularly after 2000. From a history of generally limited engagement in terms of responding to U.S. policies and a traditional interpretation of consular protection activities, Mexico has gradually developed more active policies in relation to the diaspora and began a process of redefining its position on emigration. In addition to the processes of political change in Mexico and the growing impact of migrants' transnational activities, changes in Mexico's emigration policies are also a result of transformations in foreign policy principles and strategies, mainly as a result of the evolution of U.S.-Mexico relations since the late 1980s and particularly since NAFTA. These findings demonstrate the significance of international factors - namely host state - sending state relations and foreign policy interests, discourse, and traditions - in the design and implementation of migration policies and the need to develop multi-level analyses to explain states' objectives, interests, and capacities in the management of migration.	1	Alexandra Delano
Reher, David & Javier Silvestre. 2009. 'Internal Migration Patterns of Foreign-born Immigrants in a Country of Recent Mass Immigration: Evidence From New Micro Data for Spain1.' International Migration Review. 43:4 815-849.	International Migration Review	2009	8	This paper extends the literature on the internal migration patterns of the foreign-born by analyzing the situation in Spain, a country affected by recent but very significant migratory flows. We utilize a standard theoretical framework in order to assess the relative importance of human capital, economic, and social capital indicators. To this end, we take advantage of a new micro database, the National Immigrant Survey (Encuesta Nacional de Inmigrantes- ENI-2007). Our findings suggest that the main theories explaining internal migration patterns of the foreign-born are at least partly true. Evidence is presented in support of the importance of education and knowledge of the native language, income, and networks based on the sharing of social capital among family members, though less so for those based on friends and acquaintances. Spanish citizenship and employment status seem to be less important in explaining the propensity to move within the country. We argue that the lack of significance of some indicators is due mainly to the fact that Spain has become a major destination only very recently as well as to the way different immigrant groups tend to implement strategies for promotion and integration.	2	David S.

Pena, Anita. 2009. 'Locational Choices of the Legal and Illegal: the Case of Mexican Agricultural Workers in the Us1.' International Migration Review. 43:4 850-880.	International Migration Review	2009	3	This paper examines relationships between legal and illegal farmworker migration from Mexico and state-level labor market, agricultural, demographic, and public policy variables. The study uses a nationally representative farmworker survey providing direct legal status data. Consistent with previous literature, results indicate that personal and community networks are primary determinants of locational choices. Conversely, border enforcement is negatively related to migration to certain areas. Results are strongest for California migrants and for those with previous migration experience. Potential welfare and education program values are uncorrelated with locations of recent Mexican agricultural workers.	1	Anita Alves Pena

International Migration Review. 43:4 881-907.	International Migration Review	2009	5	Drawing upon 120 semi-structured interviews with irregular migrants in Belgium, this article focuses on their aspirations and the resources needed in order to realize these. It is demonstrated that specific aspirations require specific forms of capital. A typology is constructed, based on three types of aspirations with corresponding resources. First, investment migrants, who aspire to return and invest in upward social mobility in their country of origin, require job competencies (cultural capital) and social leverage (social capital). Second, legalization migrants, who aspire to obtain legal residence, require different forms of capital, depending on the marriage market they are active in. Third, settlement migrants, aiming at residing legally or illegally in the receiving society, require both social support and social leverage (combined social capital). These findings indicate it is important to adopt a contextualized approach studying the mechanisms through which various forms of capital lead to different outcomes for irregular migrants.	3	Masja Meeteren; Godfried Engbersen; Marion San
Ruben, Ruerd, Marieke Houte & Tine Davids. 2009. 'What Determines the Embeddedness of Forced-return Migrants? Rethinking the Role of Pre- and Post-return Assistance1.' International Migration Review. 43:4 908-937.	International Migration Review	2009	3	Return migration is not always a process of simply ``going home.'' Particularly when return is not fully voluntarily, returnees face severe obstacles. This study argues that such return can only become sustainable when returnees are provided with possibilities to become re-embedded in terms of economic, social network, and psychosocial dimensions. We analyze the return migration experiences of 178 rejected asylum seekers and migrants who did not obtain residence permit to six different countries: Afghanistan, Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Sierra Leone, Togo and Vietnam. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods of data analysis, we identify several key factors that influence prospects for embeddedness, such as individual and family characteristics, position in the migration cycle, and the role of pre- and post-return assistance. We find that the possibilities for successful return are highly dependent on the living circumstances provided in the host country: returnees who were enabled to engage in work, had access to independent housing and freedom to develop social contacts proved to be better able to exercise agency and maintain self-esteem. Post-return assistance by non-governmental organizations will be particularly helpful when financial support is combined with human guidance and practical information to enhance a more sustainable return process.	3	Ruerd Ruben; Marieke Houte; Tine Davids
Nekby, Lena, Magnus Rodin & Gulay Ozcan. 2009. 'Acculturation Identity and Higher Education: Is There a Trade-off Between Ethnic Identity and Education?1.' International Migration Review. 43:4 938-973.	International Migration Review	2009	1	This paper examines the role of identification to home and host cultures on the pursuit of higher educations for individuals with immigrant backgrounds. Identity is defined according to a two-dimensional acculturation framework based on strength of identification to both ethnic background cultures and the majority culture. Results indicate that integrated men that identify with both the majority and the background culture are associated with higher probabilities of completed tertiary educations than men that identify only with the majority culture as well as men with weak affiliations to both background and majority cultures. These results hold despite controls for early education outcomes and socioeconomic status. No systematic differences in higher educational attainment by identity are found for women once differences in early education are accounted for. These results put into question the premise of oppositional identities, i.e., a trade-off between ethnic identity and higher educational achievement.	3	Lena Nekby; Magnus Rodin; Gulay Ozcan

International Migration Review	2009	3	This paper focuses on the association between migration and gender roles measured by women's paid work. The main migrant group of this study, its context and the method of analysis provide opportunity to meet this objective appropriately. The paper focuses on female migrants from the Middle East and North Africa region, who are often characterized by traditional gender roles including women's low rates of paid work. The residing country of this migrant group is Australia, which holds different gender roles including women's high work participation rate. Accordingly, the multivariate results of this paper provide empirical evidence to examine the effects of migration on gender roles.	1	Yaghoob Foroutan
Hill, Jonathan & Daniel Olson. 2009. 'Market Share and Religious Competition: Do Small Market Share Congregations and Their Leaders Try Harder ?.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 48:4 629-649.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	10	A central claim of the religious economies model is that religious competition affects levels of religious participation and commitment primarily because religious competition pushes the suppliers of religion (religious leaders and organizations) to market their faith more vigorously and effectively. We examine whether U.S. congregations experiencing greater religious competition measured by their smaller religious market share do more to recruit new members, offer more services to current followers, and whether their clergy work longer hours. The efforts of congregations and clergy do vary substantially, but this variation is not related to their denomination's market share. The variations are also not due to religious pluralism, intradenominational competition, or evangelical market share. Members of small market share congregations are more committed, but this higher commitment does not appear to arise because religious suppliers are responding to religious competition. Several alternative explanations for the higher commitment levels of small market share groups are offered with a discussion of the implications for theories of religious competition.	2	Jonathan P.

Starks, Brian & Robert Robinson. 2009. 'Two Approaches to Religion and Politics: Moral Cosmology and Subcultural Identity*.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 48:4 650-669.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	5	We explore two competing approaches to internal religious divisions and their political consequences. The ``moral cosmology'' approach focuses on religious worldviews. It juxtaposes the religiously orthodox to modernists, arguing that the former are theologically communitarian in belief while the latter are individualistic. The religiously orthodox worldview (relative to modernists) is posited to lead to politically conservative stances on cultural issues of abortion, sexuality, and family but politically liberal stances on economic issues. In contrast, the ``subcultural identity'' approach focuses on identity rather than worldview. According to this approach, self-identified evangelicals and fundamentalists are expected to be more politically conservative on both cultural and economic issues when compared to mainline or liberal Protestants. Through analyses of the 1998 GSS, which allows operationalization of the two approaches and their extension to Catholic identities, we find that cosmology and identity are associated, but they have independent-and sometimes opposite-effects on Americans' political beliefs.	2	Brian Starks; Robert V.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	2	An extensive literature has explored the effects of religion on opinions about environmental protection and action on environmental issues, but has largely concerned itself with the effects of theology as inspired by the Lynn White thesis. However, religion is multifaceted and any complete study should also incorporate the social dimensions of religious experience. In this article, we employ a unique data set to demonstrate the varied informational effects of church membership on environmental attitudes. We find that social sources of information in the church shape the dimensions of religious belief and exert much stronger effects on attitudes on the environment than do doctrinal or religiosity measures.	2	Paul A.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	9	Analysis of International Social Survey Program (ISSP) data collected in 18 Western countries in 1998 demonstrates that Christian desires for a public role of religion are strongest in countries where Christian religiosity is numerically most marginal. Moreover, Dutch data covering the period 1970-1996 confirm that the decline of the number of Christians in the Netherlands has been coincided by a strengthening of the call for public religion among the remaining faithful and by increased polarization about this with the nonreligious. Religious decline and religious privatization, two of the most crucial dimensions of secularization (Casanova 1994), hence develop dialectically: as the number of Christians declines, the remaining faithful seem increasingly unwilling to accept the ``secularist truce''--the secularist contract that guarantees religious freedom yet bans religion from the public sphere by relegating it to the private realm.	6	Peter Achterberg; Dick Houtman; Stef Aupers; Willem Koster; Peter Mascini; Jeroen Waal
Storm, Ingrid. 2009. 'Halfway to Heaven: Four Types of Fuzzy Fidelity in Europe.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 48:4 702-718.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	13	People who are neither very religious nor specifically nonreligious are generally understudied despite comprising on average half the national population in most European countries. From its size alone, we should expect this group to hold some of the clues, not only to how religious change takes place in Europe, but also why. Using the Religious and Moral Pluralism (RAMP) survey from 10 European countries, four subtypes of ``fuzzy fidelity'' were identified through cluster analysis. These included both ``believing without belonging'' and ``belonging without believing.'' Detailed analysis of each type show great national differences in the ways that religion is practiced and understood. A sizable minority of the Dutch population can be classified as ``Believing without belonging,'' whereas Scandinavians are much more likely to belong without believing. The diversity of the religious landscape within fuzzy fidelity highlights the methodological issues involved in using single-scale measures for multidimensional phenomena.	1	Ingrid Storm

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	16	Prior research on those who are ``not religious'' in the traditional, organizational sense has focused on a broad category of people in the United States who do not identify with an established religious tradition. We distinguish three categories of people who are religiously nonbelieving or nonbelonging: atheists, agnostics, and unchurched believers. Examining issues of religious belief and identity, we compare private spiritual life, attitudes on political issues, and stance toward religion in the public sphere for these three categories of nonreligious respondents. Atheists are the most uniformly antireligious. Agnostics, by comparison, are less opposed to religion overall, while unchurched believers display higher levels of personal religiosity and spirituality than atheists or agnostics. While atheists, agnostics, and unchurched believers are similar in their political identification and attitudes related to religiously infused political topics, unchurched believers are as strongly opposed to religion in the public sphere as atheists.	2	Joseph O'Brian Baker; Buster Smith

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	2	The underlying assumption of this article is that prophetic statements composed for publication in religious organizations as the word of God are, in some form and to some degree, socially constructed. We expand on this assumption by comparing and contrasting The Family International and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints-both of which are organized around belief in ongoing prophecy and revelation. Derived from our comparative analysis of these two religious groups, we formulate a prophecy typology that specifies (1) the channels through which revelations are proclaimed (a designated individual or group of collaborators) and (2) the modality of prophetic statements attributed to a divine source (inspirational or oracular). Based on this typology we conclude by proposing a set of hypotheses for guiding further studies in the social construction of prophecy.	2	Gordon Shepherd; Gary Shepherd

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	4	This study has two goals. The first goal is to see if church-based social relationships are associated with change in self-esteem. Emotional support from fellow church members and having a close personal relationship with God serve as measures of church-based social ties. The second goal is to see whether emotional support from fellow church members is more strongly associated with self-esteem than emotional support from secular social network members. The data come from an ongoing nationwide survey of older adults. The findings reveal that having a close personal relationship with God is associated with a stronger sense of self-esteem at the baseline and follow-up interviews. In contrast, emotional support from fellow church members was not associated with self-esteem at either point in time. However, emotional support from secular social network members is related to self-esteem at the baseline but not the follow-up interview.	1	Neal Krause

According to the 2005 Korean Census, the Korean population consists of 23 percent Buddhists, 18 percent Protestants, and 11 percent Catholics, with 47 percent nonreligious. To accurately describe Korean religion in recent periods, we have used 1985, 1995, and 2005 Korean Censuses. We found that Korean people became more religious from 1985 to 1995, but that change was stalled from 1995 to 2005. The percentages of Buddhists and Protestants exhibited little change, and Buddhism continues to be an important religion in the lives of Koreans. Only the number of Catholics increased from 5 percent in 1985 to 11 percent in 2005, and the increasing percentage of Catholics occurred within all subgroups, regardless of age, gender, education, home ownership, and urbanicity.	4	Jibum Kim; Yongmo Lee; Jaesok Son; Tom W.

Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health), we used a person-oriented analysis to categorize young men according to patterns of adolescent religious involvement. Youth indentified as ``highly religious evangelical'' are more likely to enlist in the military compared to their ``highly religious nonevangelical'' and ``nonreligious'' counterparts; however, these findings hold only for those young men without college experience. These findings are discussed along with study limitations and promising directions for future research.	5	Amy M. Burdette; Victor Wang; Glen H. Elder; Terrence D. Hill; Janel Benson

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 48:4 805-816.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2009	4	Recent years have witnessed the resurgence of conservative Protestantism and its adherents' advocacy of gender traditionalism. Scholarship has traced conservative Protestant women's support for gender traditionalism to biblical inerrancy while linking conservative Protestant men's support for gender traditionalism to their denominational affiliation. Our study revisits this issue with more recent data, more sophisticated analytical techniques (structural equation modeling), and a refined measure of theological conservatism (accounting for beliefs pertaining to scripture, sin, and salvation). We find that theological conservatism is significantly related to gender traditionalism among conservative Protestant women but not men. For men, strength of denominational affiliation is more strongly related to traditionalist ideology. Strength of affiliation also affects gender ideology for women, but its effects, as well as those of religious attendance, are largely indirect through theological conservatism. We discuss these sex-specific patterns of religious influence in the context of conservative Protestantism exhibiting characteristics of a gendered institution.	2	John P. Bartkowski; Lynn M. Hempel

We examine differences in the prevalence of this experience by education, region, religious tradition, marital status, age, and race.	2	Mark Chaves; Diana Garland

As a feminist pragmatist, MacLean was both a theorist and practitioner who used qualitative and quantitative methods. She set precedents in the Chicago school of ethnography, participant observation, and critical methodology. MacLean, however, was not the ``mother'' of ethnography. Harriet Martineau holds a far stronger claim to be a founding contributor to the origin and development of ethnographic methodologies in the social sciences.	3	Mary Jo Deegan; Michael R.

Aneshensel, Carol. 2009. 'Toward Explaining Mental Health Disparities.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:4 377-394.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	26	Mental health disparities refer to the disproportionate amount of psychopathology found among persons of disadvantageous social standing, such as persons of low socioeconomic status (SES). Although social and self selection cannot entirely be ruled out as explanations for these differences, the accumulation of evidence supports a social causation interpretation for a large portion of this association for many disorders. The stress process model is applied to understand how social inequities become mental health disparities. Data from the Los Angeles Depression Study, originated by Leo Reeder are used to illustrate the key idea that explicit causal models are essential to the development of programmatic interventions to alleviate mental health disparities, as distinct from interventions to improve mental health in general. In light of recent work on neighborhood stratification and mental health, I advocate the modification of the social contexts of the stress process.	1	Carol S. Aneshensel
Wolfe, Joseph. 2009. 'Age at First Birth and Alcohol Use.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:4 395-409.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	3	Two theoretical perspectives, role incompatibility and stress proliferation, suggest that age at first birth is associated with alcohol use, but each theory offers distinct predictions about the effect of relatively early parenthood on alcohol use. This study examines the applicability of these perspectives using data spanning over twenty years (1982 to 2002)from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). Results from fixed effects and multilevel models indicate that people decrease binge drinking surrounding the transition into parenthood regardless of age at first birth. However relatively young parents increase binge drinking as they age from early to later adulthood, while others decrease drinking. Findings support an integration of the two theoretical perspectives. Role incompatibility best describes the initial effect of parenthood, but predictions drawn from stress proliferation more accurately describe the association between early parenthood and binge drinking into later adulthood.	1	Joseph D.

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	7	We utilize data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth young adult sample (N = 1, 488) to investigate whether gender role attitudes and the occupation of and transition to three adult roles (i.e., employment, marriage, and parenthood) contribute to the maintenance of the gender gap in the frequency and quantity of alcohol use. Our results indicate that traditional gender role attitudes are related to less frequent drinking for both men and women, but role attitudes are not associated with the number of drinks consumed We also find that employment and transitions to employment increase the frequency and quantity of drinking, but less so for women compared to men. Furthermore, marriage, parenthood, and transitions to parenthood are related to less frequent drinking for women only. In terms of the number of drinks consumed, only employment and transitions to employment distinguish men and women. Employment is related to increased quantity of drinking for men, but decreased drinking for women, while transitions to employment have no effect on men, but do decrease the amount of drinking for women. Marriage decreases the number of drinks consumed equally for both men and women.	2	C. Andre Christie-Mizell; Robert L. Peralta

Research on the relationship between residential segregation and health outcomes lacks national-level investigation of racial and ethnic minority groups other than African Americans. I use multilevel analyses to examine the associations of residential isolation and clustering with birth weight among Asian, black, and Latino Americans using data from the National Center for Health Statistics' Natality Files and the US. Census. Findings indicate that segregation has a negative effect on the likelihood of having a low birth weight baby among Asian Americans, suggesting a possible concentration of social and structural resources in highly-segregated communities. On the contrary, segregation marginally increases the odds of low birth weight among African Americans, but only in the presence of higher poverty rates. Segregation does not affect birth weight among Latino Americans.	1	Emily Walton

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	14	Using a predominately Mexican-origin Latino sample of 5th grade students from the Southwestern United States, this study examined the relative effects of perceived discrimination and acculturation stress on substance use, and it assessed whether these effects were moderated by linguistic acculturation or time in the United States. Although rates of substance use were generally low in the sample, given the young age of the participants, over half (59\%) of the sample perceived some discrimination, and almost half (47\%) experienced some acculturation stress. Spanish-dominant and bilingual youth perceived more discrimination than English-dominant youth, whereas youth who have been in the United States five or fewer years perceived more discrimination than youth with more time in the United States. Youth who were Spanish-dominant or were recent arrivals experienced the most acculturation stress, with levels declining as linguistic acculturation and time in the United States increased. Multiple regression estimates indicated that perceived discrimination was associated with larger amounts and higher frequency of recent substance use and an array of substance use attitudes, such as stronger intentions to use substances, espousal of pro-drug norms, more positive substance use expectancies, and peer approval of substance use. Although acculturation stress was not associated with substance use, it was positively associated with several substance use attitudes, which are known antecedents of actual use. With a few exceptions, linguistic acculturation and time in the United States did not moderate the effects of perceived discrimination or acculturation stress.	3	Stephen Kulis; Flavio Francisco Marsiglia; Tanya Nieri
Russell, David. 2009. 'Living Arrangements, Social Integration, and Loneliness in Later Life: the Case of Physical Disability.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:4 460-475.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	6	Despite the theoretical linkages between household composition and social integration, relatively limited research has considered how living arrangements affect risk for loneliness in later life. Prior work has also failed to consider whether physical disability moderates this potentially important relationship. Using data from a sample of older adults with and without a physical disability (N = 868), this study aims to (1) document variations in loneliness across living arrangements, (2) assess whether any observed association varies by physical disability status, and (3) evaluate the mediating role of social integration and social support. Results reveal that those living alone or with people other than a spouse (children, extended family members) report greater loneliness than those living with a spouse. However the magnitude of these differences is greater for older adults with a physical disability. Measures of social integration and social support attenuated, but did not fully explain, inter-household variations in loneliness. These findings point to the independent significance of living arrangements for experiences of loneliness in later life among both disabled and nondisabled adults.	1	David Russell
Burgard, Sarah & Jennifer Ailshire. 2009. 'Putting Work to Bed: Stressful Experiences on the Job and Sleep Quality.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 50:4 476-492.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2009	8	Most adults spend one-third of every day sleeping and another third of most days at work. However, there is little analysis of the possible connections between common workplace experiences and sleep quality. This study uses the longitudinal and nationally-representative Americans' Changing Lives study to examine whether and how common conditions and experiences at work may ``follow workers home'' and impinge on their quality of sleep. We also explore how competing stressful experiences at home may influence sleep quality, and whether these are more salient than work experiences. Results show that frequently being bothered or upset at work is associated with poorer sleep quality, and the association is not explained by stressful experiences at home. These findings are discussed in relation to the sociological literatures on work, stress, and emotion.	2	Sarah A. Burgard; Jennifer A. Ailshire
Burton, Linda, Andrew Cherlin, Donna-Marie Winn, Angela Estacion & Clara Holder-Taylor. 2009. 'the Role of Trust in Low-income Mothers' Intimate Unions.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:5 1107-1124.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	10	Recent scholarship concerning low rates of marriage among low-income mothers emphasizes generalized gender distrust as a major impediment in forming sustainable intimate unions. Guided by symbolic interaction theory and longitudinal ethnographic data on 256 low-income mothers from the Three-City Study, we argue that generalized gender distrust may not be as influential in shaping mothers' unions as some researchers suggest. Grounded theory analysis revealed that 96\% of the mothers voiced a general distrust of men, yet that distrust did not deter them from involvement in intimate unions. Rather, the pivotal ways mothers enacted trust in their partners were demonstrated by 4 emergent forms of interpersonal trust that we labeled as suspended, compartmentalized, misplaced, and integrated. Implications for future research are discussed.	5	Linda M. Burton; Andrew Cherlin; Donna-Marie Winn; Angela Estacion; Clara Holder-Taylor

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	14	We explored the influences of women's social learning, marital resources and constraints, and exposure to norms about women's family roles on their views about wife hitting or beating among 5,450 participants in the 2005 Egypt Demographic and Health Survey. One half justified wife hitting or beating for some reason. Women from rural areas who were exposed to domestic violence more often justified such acts. Dependent wives whose husbands had more schooling, were blood relatives, and were coresident more often justified such acts. In settings where women tended to marry at older ages, women less often justified such acts. Women's resources and constraints in marriage accounted for the largest share of the variability in their attitudes about domestic violence against women.	2	Kathryn M. Yount; Li Li
Soons, Judith & Matthijs Kalmijn. 2009. 'Is Marriage More Than Cohabitation? Well-being Differences in 30 European Countries.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:5 1141-1157.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	23	The study aims to assess, first, whether there is a gap in well-being between unmarried cohabitants and the married, second, if selection factors can explain this so-called cohabitation gap, and third, if the size of the cohabitation gap differs across countries and how this can be explained. We use pooled data from young adults (18-44) in 3 rounds of the European Social Survey (N 31, 500). Multilevel regression analyses show that there is a moderate cohabitation gap that can be partly explained with the selection factors material resources and religiosity. Country differences were clear and could partly be explained with the level of institutionalization: In countries where cohabitation is more accepted and more prevalent, the cohabitation gap is smaller.	2	Judith P.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	14	Although the association of being married and a lower mortality rate has been well established, most previous research on marital status and mortality did not consider potential change in this relationship over time. In this study, I adopted a survey cohort perspective to examine both overall and cause-specific mortality trends by marital status from 1986 to 2000 in the United States. On the basis of data from the National Health Interview Survey-Longitudinal Mortality Follow-up (N = 517,314), I found that mortality generally decreased or remained stable for the married from the 1986 to 2000 NHIS cohort, except for diabetes deaths. There is evidence showing divergent mortality trends between the married and unmarried, especially the widowed. Race and gender variations are examined.	1	Hui Liu

Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:5 1174-1192.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	1	This research was designed to increase our understanding of how the motivational antecedents to childbearing and emotional responses to pregnancy affect the subsequent attachment bond of a toddler to his or her mother. Using a sample of 1,364 mothers and their newborns from the Study of Early Child Care, we tested a mother-child influence framework hypothesized to mediate between the mother's preconception motivation and pregnancy wantedness and her child's security of attachment at 24 months. Almost all elements of the mediational sequence were confirmed in a structural equation model. We observed 2 unmediated pathways to attachment security, 1 from preconception motivation and 1 from parenting stress during infancy, and suggest interpretations of these unexpected pathways.	3	Warren B.

Roeters, Anne, Tanja Lippe & Esther Kluwer. 2009. 'Parental Work Demands and the Frequency of Child-related Routine and Interactive Activities.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:5 1193-1204.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	8	This study examined whether the frequency of child-related activities was associated with parents' own work demands and those of their partners. In addition to parental paid working hours, we considered the parents' organizational culture and experienced job insecurity. Moreover, we differentiated between child-related routine and interactive activities. Using self-collected data on 639 Dutch couples with children, we found that paid working hours were consistently associated with a lower frequency of child-related activities. Fathers generally responded more strongly to their own and their partner's work demands than mothers. For fathers, both their own and their partner's work demands were more strongly associated with routine than with interactive activities. Mothers did not differentiate between these activities, however.	3	Anne Roeters; Tanja Lippe; Esther S. Kluwer

Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:5 1205-1219.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	2	The present paper investigated whether higher cohesion and satisfaction with family bonds were associated with the daily experience of emotional well-being in varying social circumstances. Using a sample of school-age adolescents (N = 95) and both their parents, data were gathered daily over 1 week using a diary approach in addition to self-report instruments. Multilevel analyses revealed higher cohesion to be associated with well-being in fathers and adolescents, but not in mothers. Parents also reported higher well-being when with friends or colleagues than when alone. Moreover, fathers who scored higher on cohesion reported higher well-being when with family members than when alone, whereas adolescents who scored higher on satisfaction with bonds reported lower well-being when with peers or siblings than when alone.	4	C.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	37	Parents may provide many types of support to their grown children. Parents age 40 to 60 (N = 633) reported the support they exchange with each child over age 18 (N = 1,384). Mothers and fathers differentiated among children within families, but provided emotional, financial, and practical help on average every few weeks to each child. Offspring received most assistance when they (a) had greater needs (because of problems or younger age) or (b) were perceived as more successful. Parents received more from high achieving offspring. Findings support contingency theory; parents give more material and financial support to children in need. Motivation to enhance the self or to assure support later in life may explain support to high achieving offspring.	4	Karen Fingerman; Laura Miller; Kira Birditt; Steven Zarit

Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:5 1234-1253.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	4	In many parts of Western Europe the age at first marriage and the level of celibacy declined in the second half of the 19th century. This weakening of the European marriage pattern (EMP) can be interpreted as a ``classic'' response to the increase of the standard of living, but a more far-reaching interpretation is that the erosion of the EMP was part of a cultural shift characterized by the rise of a new, less instrumental and more egalitarian view on marriage and partner selection. The latter vision implies the increase of the preference for a same age marriage. We test this explanation by using a combined Belgian-Dutch data set of marriage certificates (N = 766,412). Our findings corroborate the ``cultural shift thesis.''.	8	Bart Putte; Frans Van; Sofie Vanassche; Maria Sanchez; Svetlana Jidkova; Mieke Eeckhaut; Michel Oris; Koen Matthijs

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	10	This study examines how relationship transitions affect subjective well-being (SWB) and how this effect changes over time. We used prospective data containing information about 18 years of young adults' lives (PSIN, N = 5, 514). SWB was measured with the Satisfaction with Life Scale. Within-person multilevel regression analyses showed that dating, unmarried cohabitation, and marriage had additional well-being enhancing effects. After entry into a union, well-being slowly decreased. A large SWB decrease was found after union dissolution, but through adaptation or repartnering well-being increased again. Well-being of never-married and never-cohabiting young adults decreased slowly over time. These effects were independent of parenthood and employment. Our results confirm expectations from the resources theory but contradict some assumptions of the set-point theory.	3	Judith P. Soons; Aart C. Liefbroer; Matthijs Kalmijn

Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:5 1271-1293.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	3	The economic consequences of a partnership dissolution have been described consistently in the research literature. For women all studies indicate severe financial losses, whereas men do not experience income decreases to the same extent. This article focuses on the 2 main strategies to cope with the economic consequences of a separation: repartnering and (re)employment. Using the European Community Household Panel Study we analyzed a sample of 66,292 individuals observed in a relationship of whom 4,925 subsequently separated and assessed the (relative) effect of both strategies in a cross-national longitudinal perspective. Where men do not benefit financially from cohabiting with a new partner, repartnering proves to outweigh the benefits of reentering the labor force or increasing the working hours for most women. This especially applies to mothers.	3	Mieke Jansen; Dimitri Mortelmans; Laurent Snoeckx

Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:5 1294-1308.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	1	This article considers associations among childhood family structure, childhood religious service attendance, and the probability of having a nonmarital first birth before age 30 for non-Hispanic White women born 1944 to 1964 using data from the 1988 and 1995 waves of the National Survey of Family Growth (N = 5,995). We found that attending religious services weekly during childhood and growing up in a 2-biological-parent family were associated with lower odds of having had a nonmarital first birth. These associations were quite stable across cohorts, although religious attendance was less associated with nonmarital fertility for the youngest cohort. We estimate that changes in these childhood experiences account for 22\% of the increase in nonmarital first births across these cohorts.	2	Christopher Wildeman; Christine Percheski

Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:5 1309-1324.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	7	Using data from the 2002 Iran Fertility Transition Survey, we examined birth control use between marriage and first pregnancy. We focused on the post-1990 increase in birth control use and develop two explanations. The first posits that birth control use reflects a new marriage form, the conjugal marriage, which places a heightened value on the spousal relationship while deemphasizing the centrality of parenthood. A second explanation stresses the use of a new resource, effective birth control, within an Iranian-Islamist view of marriage. Key to this explanation is the role of the state-Iranian political/religious actors encourage early marriage and the use of birth control. Although the explanations could be complementary, evidence provides more support for the latter.	4	Mohammad Jalal Abbasi-Shavazi; S. Philip Morgan; Meimanat Hossein-Chavoshi; Peter McDonald
Creighton, Mathew, Hyunjoon Park & Graciela Teruel. 2009. 'the Role of Migration and Single Motherhood in Upper Secondary Education in Mexico.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 71:5 1325-1339.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	6	We investigated the link between migration, family structure, and the risk of dropping out of upper secondary school in Mexico. Using two waves of the Mexican Family Life Survey, which includes 1,080 upper secondary students, we longitudinally modeled the role of family structure in the subsequent risk of dropping out, focusing on the role of migration in single motherhood. We found that children living without a father because of international migration or divorce or separation are at a greater risk relative to children in 2-parent households. Economic characteristics of the household provide a partial explanation for children living in single-mother households because of divorce or separation but do not explain the greater risk of dropping out for children with fathers in the United States.	3	Mathew J.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2009	3	Child-care vouchers are becoming more common and can provide child-care assistance to a wide spectrum of the population. There is little empirical research, however, on which workers participate in their employer's child-care programs. In this exploratory study, employees with children at 1 large university completed questionnaires to gather information on their child-care arrangements and their experience with the employer's child-care voucher program (N = 949). Results indicate that the employees who were most in need of child-care assistance in terms of family structure, job type, and child-care expenses were more likely to receive vouchers. Federal policy limiting the structure of employer-sponsored voucher programs appeared to present barriers to participation for certain groups of employees.	2	Taryn W. Morrissey; Mildred E. Warner
Gupta, Devashree. 2009. 'the Power of Incremental Outcomes: How Small Victories and Defeats Affect Social Movement Organizations.' Mobilization. 14:4, SI 417-432.	Mobilization	2009	1	This article examines how incremental outcomes-gains and losses that stop short of decisive victory defeat-influence movement organizations, particularly, in terms of the public financial support they enjoy and the amount of money they subsequently allocate to programmatic expenses. Drawing on data from the US anti-death penalty movement, I find that small gains and losses significantly influence support and spending patterns. Movement success initially increases both financial contributions and programmatic spending, but over time. decreases both. Moreover the particular effect is mediated by the type of venue in which the outcome takes place: formal institutions produce different rates of increase and decline than informal ones. These differences have important implications for movement organizations' choice of venue in which they make their claims while emphasizing the importance of considering incremental outcomes not only as end products of contention, but as inputs that are consequential for future movement development.	1	Devashree Gupta

Mobilization	2009	3	This article investigates the empirical evidence for the statement that the impact of social movement organizations (SMOs) and interest groups on policy making is dependent on public opinion and the political system. A meta-analysis of articles published in eleven sociology and political science journals from 1990 to 2007 is used to lest two hypotheses: 1) when public opinion is taken into account, SMOs and interest groups have no direct effect on policy; 2) the existence of a democratic regime is a necessary precondition for finding any policy impact of SMOs and interest groups. Results show that laking account of public opinion does not generally make any difference in the finding of direct effect. . However, the role of public opinion varies across the measures of organizational resources and activity. I also find that a democratic regime is not a necessary precondition for the impact of SMOs and interest groups on public policy, but show that a direct effect of interest organizations is less likely to be found in the studies that take account of political regime.	1	Katrin Uba

Mobilization	2009	0	This article aims to contribute to the debates on how cultural context influences mobilization outcomes through a comparative analysis of two Israeli social movement organizations that supported conscientious objectors and draft resisters during the second Palestinian Intifada. This analysis has two objectives. The first is to show how cultural and institutional conditions of Israeli militarism influenced both the discourses and the tactics of resistance of the movement organizations. The second is to demonstrate that different tactics of the movement organizations had a differential impact on the Israeli public and the Israeli political system. It is argued that both the culturally and institutionally; embedded gender inequality, within Israeli society has determined the choice of the available strategies for the movement organizations, which has in turn influenced the relative success of their campaigns.	1	Yulia Zemlinskaya

Here, the use qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to analyze the previous study's data. Specifically, the test the two main hypotheses based on the joint-effect model of social movement outcomes: (1) that the policy impact of social movements is conditioned by the presence of powerful allies within the institutional arenas. by, the presence of a favorable public opinion. and/or by both factors simultaneously; and (2) that social movements are more likely, to have policy impacts when they address issues and policy, domains of low saliency. In addition, we compare the policy, impact of social movements across countries. Our analysis confirms to a large extent the findings of the earlier time-series analysis, namely, the strong explanatory power of the joint-effect model of social movement outcomes and the varying impact of different movements on public policy.	2	Marco Giugni; Sakura Yamasaki
Yamasaki, Sakura. 2009. 'a Boolean Analysis of Movement Impact on Nuclear Energy Policy.' Mobilization. 14:4, SI 485-504.	Mobilization	2009	0	The impacts of social movements on public policies have been studied extensively, yet yield mixed results. Some results point to a strong impact of social movements, while others conclude that they do not possess any observable, leverage on public policies. These mixed results may be linked to utilization of different methodological approaches. However, few studies have considered the possibility that movements may in fact prevent policy change. In this study, we argue that for high-profile policies such as nuclear energy, a low-key social mobilization is in some instances necessary for the occurrence of major policy changes. We further hypothesize that highly mobilized social movements may dampen the chance of major policy changes instead of promoting them. We briefly present the general model and the data before proceeding to the bounded exploratory analysis. This analysis raises questions about the role played by antinuclear movements in their quest for a major policy change. A theoretical explanation is then presented in an attempt to contribute to the clarification of the movement-policy debate.	1	Sakura Yamasaki
Ishizawa, Hiromi. 2009. 'Dynamics of Spanish-language Neighborhoods in Chicago and Atlanta: 1990-2000.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:6 721-746.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	0	This study examines and compares how the spatial arrangements of Spanish speakers have changed over time in a traditional immigrant gateway, Chicago, and in an emerging immigrant gateway, Atlanta. Using the 1990 and 2000 U.S. Census data, spatial autocorrelation analysis confirms that Spanish-language neighborhoods continue to be in the city and the suburbs of Chicago. Atlanta's Spanish-language neighborhoods, on the other hand, are mainly located in the suburbs where major growth took place over the decade. However, Spanish-language neighborhoods in both the city and suburbs of Atlanta and Chicago share similar characteristics: higher percentages of residents who are foreign-born and limited English proficient, and households with low levels of income. While the model of spatial assimilation is still relevant to our understanding of residential patterns among contemporary immigrants and their descendants, the interpretation of findings, including those for new destinations such as Atlanta where large-scale immigration occurred after suburbanization, should place less emphasis on the central city/suburb distinction and suburban homogeneity. The growing diversity in language use among residents necessitates the provision of accessible social services and information.	1	Hiromi Ishizawa
Rayer, Stefan, Stanley Smith & Jeff Tayman. 2009. 'Empirical Prediction Intervals for County Population Forecasts.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:6 773-793.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	2	Population forecasts entail a significant amount of uncertainty, especially for long-range horizons and for places with small or rapidly changing populations. This uncertainty can be dealt with by presenting a range of projections or by developing statistical prediction intervals. The latter can be based on models that incorporate the stochastic nature of the forecasting process, on empirical analyses of past forecast errors, or on a combination of the two. In this article, we develop and test prediction intervals based on empirical analyses of past forecast errors for counties in the United States. Using decennial census data from 1900 to 2000, we apply trend extrapolation techniques to develop a set of county population forecasts; calculate forecast errors by comparing forecasts to subsequent census counts; and use the distribution of errors to construct empirical prediction intervals. We find that empirically-based prediction intervals provide reasonably accurate predictions of the precision of population forecasts, but provide little guidance regarding their tendency to be too high or too low. We believe the construction of empirically-based prediction intervals will help users of small-area population forecasts measure and evaluate the uncertainty inherent in population forecasts and plan more effectively for the future.	3	Stefan Rayer; Stanley K.

Population Research and Policy Review	2009	6	This study uses data from the New Immigrant Survey and Andersen's behavioral model, a commonly used framework for health care utilization, to examine the utilization patterns of Asian and Hispanic immigrants to the United States. Results indicate that the behavioral framework is well suited to predicting immigrants' physician visits and dentist visits. However, this model is less appropriate for determining the likelihood of reporting a hospital as the primary source of medical care or immigrants' use of non Western treatments. Importantly, years in the U.S. exhibits a robust, positive relationship with physician and dental visits for both groups even after controlling for several predisposing characteristics, self-assessed and physician-diagnosed need, pointing to the importance of this as an enabling factor in health care access and use.	1	Ilana Redstone Akresh
Powers, Daniel & Seung-Eun Song. 2009. 'Absolute Change in Cause-specific Infant Mortality for Blacks and Whites in the Us: 1983-2002.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:6 817-851.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	2	This paper examines absolute change in infant mortality from 5 leading causes of death for whites and blacks over a 20 year period. Change in infant mortality varies by cause, race, and birth weight. Absolute decline in mortality from respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the overall study population has been more rapid for black infants during the period after specific technological innovations were approved and behavioral practices were recommended for these conditions. For low birth weight infants, blacks experienced greater decline in mortality from SIDS and whites experienced greater decline in RDS mortality. Despite remarkable declines in mortality from these causes, relative racial disparities have increased over this time period. For the overall study population, blacks and whites experienced similar rates of mortality decline from congenital anomalies. Mortality decline from this cause among low birth weight infants occurred at a faster pace for whites. Mortality from causes for which no specific innovations were developed increased for blacks but remained relatively constant for whites. An analysis of absolute change complements the relative disparities approach by revealing the dynamics of change, thus providing a more complete understanding of changing racial disparities in infant mortality.	2	Daniel A.

Guzzo, Karen. 2009. 'Paternity Establishment for Men's Nonmarital Births.' Population Research and Policy Review. 28:6 853-872.	Population Research and Policy Review	2009	4	This paper uses the 2002 National Survey of Family Growth to examine paternity establishment among men's nonmarital births. Using births as the unit of analysis, I find that paternity establishment for first births (n = 661) is linked to race/ethnicity and relationship status at birth, and these characteristics are associated differently with the timing and location of paternity establishment (in-hospital or at some later point). For higher-parity births (n = 429), paternity establishment for a particular birth is strongly related to prior paternity and fertility behaviors. Paternity is less likely to be established for a higher-parity birth if the father failed to establish paternity for at least one earlier birth, and third or higher-parity births are far more likely to have paternity established at a subsequent point than at the hospital.	1	Karen Benjamin Guzzo
Rutherford, Markella. 2009. 'Children's Autonomy and Responsibility: an Analysis of Childrearing Advice.' Qualitative Sociology. 32:4 337-353.	Qualitative Sociology	2009	2	Employing qualitative content analysis of 300 childrearing advice articles from Parents magazine, this paper maps historical changes in the depiction of parental authority and children's autonomy. This popular text reveals increased autonomy for children in their private self-expression, especially in regard to activities of daily living, personal appearance, and defiance of parents. However, the magazine also portrays children's diminished public autonomy as revealed through increasingly restricted freedom of movement and substantially delayed acceptance of meaningful responsibilities. An appreciation of popular childrearing advice as a measure of individualistic cultural values thus requires an understanding of larger social changes that shift attention from public participation toward private self-expression.	1	Markella B.

Qualitative Sociology	2009	1	Models that purport to explain the interplay between dissidents and the state generally assert, either explicitly or implicitly, that the path from state interests to action to outcomes is a linear one. Using the case of the United Klans of America (UKA) in North Carolina, I argue that state efforts to exert social control upon a perceived threat are shaped by a range of internal and external contingencies. In particular, I undertake a comparative analysis of two state agencies to demonstrate how a particular mechanism-ambivalence, here conceptualized as the relational consequence of a mismatch between organizational culture and organizational goals-leads to distinct, and sometimes heterogeneous, actions and outcomes not directly traceable to organizational mandates. Findings lend insight into how endogenous organizational processes shape contentious political outcomes in potentially divergent ways.	1	David Cunningham

Qualitative Sociology	2009	19	This ethnographic study of commercial gestational surrogacy in a small clinic in western India introduces the concept of ``everyday forms of kinship''aEuro''kinship ties as the product of conscious everyday strategy, and, at times, as a vehicle for survival and/or resistance. The surrogates' constructions of kinship as a daily process disrupt kinship theories that are based solely on biology. So, too, do they disrupt the patrilineal assumptions made in studies of Indian kinship. Kinship ties instead find their basis in shared bodily substances (blood and breast milk) and shared company, as well as in the labor of gestation and of giving birth. By emphasizing connections based on shared bodily substance and by de-emphasizing the ties the baby has with its genetic mother and the men involved in surrogacy (the genetic fathers and the surrogates' husbands), the surrogates challenge established hierarchies in kin relationships-where genes and the male seed triumph above all. Simultaneously, by forming kinship ties with the baby, the intended mother, and other surrogates residing with them, surrogates in India form ties that cross boundaries based on class, caste and religion and sometimes even race and nation. By focusing on the notions of blood (shared substance) and sweat (labor) as basis for making kinship claims, this study both extends anthropological literature that emphasizes the non-procreative basis of kinship and feminist works that denaturalize kinship ties and make visible the labor involved in forming kinship ties and maintaining a family.	1	Amrita Pande
Kusenbach, Margarethe. 2009. 'Salvaging Decency: Mobile Home Residents' Strategies of Managing the Stigma of ``trailer'' Living.' Qualitative Sociology. 32:4 399-428.	Qualitative Sociology	2009	3	This paper is based on 45 ethnographic interviews conducted with residents of mobile home communities in West Central Florida between 2005 and 2008. It investigates their strategies of managing the stigma that is commonly associated with living in a mobile home. Informants routinely encounter negative stereotypes regarding their ``trailer'' home, community, and lifestyle in public discourse and personal interactions, and consequently have developed ways of salvaging their decency. My analysis of these strategies particularly emphasizes two versions of distancing, here called ``bordering'' and ``fencing,'' as examples of symbolic boundary work. Other techniques discussed include ignoring, passing, humoring, resisting, normalizing, upstaging, and blaming. Throughout the paper, I argue that mobile home residents' ways of salvaging decency are both similar and different compared to how other disparaged groups deal with stigmatization. The conclusion discusses broader sociological implications of the research in enhancing our understanding of the experience of stigmatization, folk conceptions of decency, symbolic and social differentiation, as well as race and class dynamics.	1	Margarethe Kusenbach
Mooney, Patrick & Scott Hunt. 2009. 'Food Security: the Elaboration of Contested Claims to a Consensus Frame.' Rural Sociology. 74:4 469-497.	Rural Sociology	2009	15	This article demonstrates Gamson's claim that behind the apparent agreement implied by ``consensus frames'' lies considerable dissensus. Ironically, the very potency of consensus frames may generate contested claims to the ownership of a social problem. Food security is a potent consensus frame that has generated at least three distinct collective action frames: food security as hunger; food security as a component of a community's developmental whole; and food security as minimizing risks with respect to an industrialized food system's vulnerability to both ``normal accidents'' as well as the ``intentional accidents'' associated with agriterrorism. We show that each collective action frame reflects internal normative variation identified here with Goffman's ``keying'' concept. These keys suggest power differentials in the endorsement or critique of dominant institutional practices. Each frame and associated keys reflect distinct sets of interests by collective actors, such as demands for substantively different applications of science and technology. The prognostic framing of the community food security movement coincidentally holds potential for reducing not only the accidental risks of productivist agriculture but also the uncertainty induced by the risk of terrorist exploitation of those vulnerabilities. The article explores power differentials and variable levels of oppositional consciousness as mechanisms by which keys generate contentious politics within frames while serving as potential bridges between frames. This contested ownership of food security has implications for the associated movements' and organizations' capacity to influence the structure of the agrifood system as well as the broader socioeconomic organization of rural regions.	2	Patrick H.

Crowe, Jessica & Jessica Goldberger. 2009. 'University-industry Relationships in Colleges of Agriculture and Life Sciences: the Role of Women Faculty.' Rural Sociology. 74:4 498-524.	Rural Sociology	2009	2	An increasing amount of research has been dedicated to studying university-industry relationships (UIRs). Researchers have studied the impacts of UIRs on the integrity of university research. However, while studies have examined the attitudes and actions of university administration and industry leaders with respect to UIRs, limited attention has been devoted to the attitudes and actions of women faculty. Drawing on feminist epistemology and academic capitalism research, we develop and test four hypotheses about gender and UIRs. We use Hierarchical Linear Modeling (HLM) and data from a nationwide survey of land-grant agricultural and life scientists to examine perceptions of UIRs and individual-level ties to private industry among male and female faculty in different academic disciplines. Although we find no significant gender differences in perceptions of UIRs, our results indicate women have fewer ties to industry compared to men when controlling for individual- and discipline-level characteristics. In particular, industry funding of scientific research and consulting for private firms appear to disproportionately favor men over women. We also find that discipline-level industry ties influence scientists' attitudes and industry linkages, suggesting the existence of different disciplinary cultures with respect to UIRs. We recommend researchers, policymakers, and others interested in understanding the growth of academic capitalism, as well as the gender gap in science, pursue more in-depth investigation of the interaction between gender, academic discipline, and UIRs.	2	Jessica A.

'Consumer Trust in the Us Food System: an Examination of the Recreancy Theorem.' Rural Sociology. 74:4 525-545.	Rural Sociology	2009	7	Because consumer opinions to an increasing extent affect the structure and management of the U.S. food system, it is important for social scientists to accurately model consumer trust in this system so they can better understand and anticipate public responses to existing or proposed food-related regulatory policies and facilitate effective partnership building between food-system representatives and the public. The recreancy theorem posits that individuals' trust in and support for societal institutions reflects their perceptions of the competence and fiduciary responsibility of institutional actors. This theorem might prove effective at identifying the key determinants of consumers' trust in and support for institutional actors within the U.S. food system, whether these actors be representatives of large-scale, internationally operated firms or small-scale, locally operated businesses. We used data from two nationwide samples of adults to test the recreancy theorem for seven to nine pertinent institutional actors each within five areas of the U.S. food system: food safety, nutrition, treatment of workers, environmental protection, and treatment of livestock. The resulting 55 tests of the theorem entailed the estimation of 55 structural equation models to evaluate model fit and the efficacy of perceived competence and fiduciary responsibility in explaining trust and support. The results of analyzing the structural equation models separately and overall indicate support for the recreancy theorem. Based upon our results, we offer suggestions for enhancing public-private partnership formation within the U.S. food system.	7	Stephen G.

Jackson, Elizabeth, Mohammed Quaddus, Nazrul Islam & John Stanton. 2009. 'Sociological Factors Affecting Agricultural Price Risk Management in Australia.' Rural Sociology. 74:4 546-572.	Rural Sociology	2009	3	The highly volatile auction system in Australia accounts for 85 percent of ex-farm wool sales, with the remainder sold by for-ward contract, futures, and other hedging methods. In this article, against the background of an extensive literature on price risk strategies, we investigate the behavioral factors associated with producers' adoption of price risk-management strategies (specifically futures and forward contracts) for selling wool. This research presents a behavioral model based on Diffusion of Innovations, the Theory of Reasoned Action, and the Theory of Planned Behavior. We found that the auction system is used as a price risk-management tool because other selling methods are considered more risky. We also report on a curious relationship between risk and complexity in terms of wool producers' intentions to use forward contracts. We explored sociological factors in conjunction with focus-group data in an attempt to understand this relationship. This exercise yielded some interesting findings on the impact that trust, habit, social cohesion, and networks have on decision making in the rural community. The significance of this article lies in its application of core sociological theory in a new research context: the Australian wool industry.	4	Elizabeth Jackson; Mohammed Quaddus; Nazrul Islam; John Stanton
Crowley, Martha & Daniel Lichter. 2009. 'Social Disorganization in New Latino Destinations?.' Rural Sociology. 74:4 573-604.	Rural Sociology	2009	13	Rural industrial restructuring, including growth in meat processing and other nondurable manufacturing, has generated employment opportunities that have attracted Latino in-migrants to new nonmetropolitan destinations. Long-time residents, however, are not always receptive. While some observers point to economic and social benefits of a Latino influx, others believe that the newcomers drain local resources, raise poverty and crime rates, and diminish the quality of life in their communities. We evaluate the influence of rapid population growth on emerging Latino destinations-new boomtowns. We use data from the U.S. census and other sources to measure changes in local economic circumstances and quality of life in nonmetropolitan boom counties experiencing high rates of Latino growth between 1990 and 2000. Our findings indicate that large influxes of Latinos had surprisingly few negative economic consequences for local populations. Furthermore, the quality of life in new destinations did not deteriorate in comparison to other nonmetropolitan counties, especially with regard to crime. Mounting pressure to educate students with limited English proficiency is nevertheless apparent. Our conclusion highlights relevant national policy debates and underscores the need for commitment on the part of firms responsible for Latino growth.	2	Martha Crowley; Daniel T. Lichter
McConnell, Eileen & Faranak Miraftab. 2009. 'Sundown Town to ``little Mexico'': Old-timers and Newcomers in an American Small Town.' Rural Sociology. 74:4 605-629.	Rural Sociology	2009	9	For more than a century, communities across the United States legally employed strategies to create and maintain racial divides. One particularly widespread and effective practice was that of ``sundown towns,'' which signaled to African Americans and others that they were not welcome within the city limits after dark. Though nearly 1,000 small towns, larger communities, and suburbs across the country may have engaged in these practices, until recently there has been little scholarship on the topic. Drawing from qualitative and quantitative sources, this article presents a case study of a midwestern rural community with a sundown history. Since 1990 large numbers of Mexican migrants have arrived there to work at the local meat-processing plant, earning the town the nickname ``Little Mexico.'' The study identifies a substantial decline in Hispanic-white residential segregation in the community between 1990 and 2000. We consider possible explanations for the increased spatial integration of Latino and white residents, including local housing characteristics and the weak enforcement of preexisting housing policies. We also describe the racialized history of this former sundown town and whether, paradoxically, its history of excluding nonwhites may have played a role in the spatial configurations of Latinos and non-Hispanic whites in 2000. Scholars investigating the contemporary processes of Latino population growth in ``new'' destinations, both in metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, may want to explore the importance of sociohistorical considerations, particularly localities' racialized historical contexts before the arrival of Mexican and other Latino immigrants.	2	Eileen Diaz McConnell; Faranak Miraftab

Social Compass	2009	1	The Satanism scare was a significant moral panic in America in the 1980s and early 1990s. Scholars analyzed it from a social constructionist perspective, citing a number of factors and developments whose confluence contributed to this high-visibility moral panic. The authors examine those factors that were deemed of importance in the rise of the Satanism scare, to ascertain why the scare seems to have waned in recent years. Particular attention is given to developments within the justice system, the professions of psychology and psychiatry, and the waning of the Anti-Cult Movement to explain why the panic lost momentum. Other contributing factors are also discussed, including the weakening of Christian Fundamentalism as a force in society and the shift of attention of the mass media and the general public to other topics. Attention also is given to various behaviors among youth that have redefined and contributed to the maintenance of Satanism as a social phenomenon of note.	3	James T.

He first surveys the evolution of Satan from the Hebrew Scriptures through the Quran, and its subsequent development in Islamic thought through the contemporary period. He then discusses the socio-economic and political environment that influenced the development of heavy metal as an art form, and why it has had such resonance in the Middle East and the larger Muslim world. Finally, he explores the largely negative reaction to the music by Muslim governments and societies, and how, in a certain sense, today's Muslim metalheads are fulfilling a historic function of Satan in Islamic theology.	1	Mark Levine

Social Compass	2009	1	The authors analyse contemporary ir/religiosity and spirituality in the Czech Republic using data from national censuses, international surveys and a specialized national survey on the de-traditionalization and individualization of religion from 2006. The authors conclude that the influence of socio-demographic characteristics on a respondent's religiosity, both traditional and alternative, is weak; a more important factor in the determination of a person's world-view was found to be his/her religious socialization or the absence thereof. The effectiveness of religious socialization differs significantly between the various churches; the least effective being the Catholic Church and Czechoslovak Hussite Church. For historical reasons, attitudes towards Catholicism also influence the Czech mind-set on religion in general. The out-of-church movement became established very early in the country's history and was subsequently strengthened by Communist anticlericalism resulting in today's prevalence of ``non-believers'', the highest proportion in Europe.	2	Dana Hamplova; Zdenek R.

Social Forces	2009	14	The term ``second shift'' from Hochschild's (1989) classic volume is commonly used by scholars to mean that employed mothers face an unequal load of household labor and thus a ``double day'' of work. We use two representative samples of contemporary U.S. parents with preschoolers to test how mothers employed fulltime and married to a full-time worker (Focal mothers) differ in time allocations and pressures from fathers and from mothers employed parttime or not at all. Results indicate focal mothers' total workloads are greater than fathers' by a week-and-a-half, not an ``extra month'' per year. Focal mothers have less leisure, but do not experience more onerous types of unpaid work, nor get less sleep than fathers. Focal mothers feel greater time pressures compared with fathers; however, some of these tensions extend to other mothers of young children. Finally, these families may be engaged in fewer quality activities with children compared with families where mothers are not employed fulltime.	3	Melissa A. Milkie; Sara B. Raley; Suzanne M.

Using nationally representative time-diary data, this study examined whether married individuals with children at home lost more spousal time in the years 1975-2003 than individuals without children at home. The analyses showed that on average married individuals have reduced their spousal time by 50 minutes a day. Contrary to expectations, however, individuals with minor children at home had lower time declines than individuals without children. The strategies that assisted married individuals with children to protect their Spousal time differed between weekdays and weekend days.	1	Jeffrey Dew
Musick, Kelly, Paula England, Sarah Edgington & Nicole Kangas. 2009. 'Education Differences in Intended and Unintended Fertility.' Social Forces. 88:2 543-572.	Social Forces	2009	5	Using a hazards framework and panel data from the National Longitudinal Survey Of Youth (1979-2004), we analyze the fertility patterns of a recent cohort of white and black women in the United States. We examine how completed fertility varies by women's education, differentiating between intended and unintended births. We find that the education gradient on fertility comes largely from unintended childbearing, and it is not explained by child-bearing desires or opportunity costs, the two most common explanations in previous research. Less-educated women want no more children than die more educated, so this factor explains none of their higher completed fertility. Less-educated women have lower wages, but wages have little of the negative effect on fertility predicted by economic theories of opportunity cost. We propose three other potential mechanisms linking low education and unintended childbearing, focusing on access to contraception and abortion, relational and economic uncertainty, and consistency in the behaviors necessary to avoid unintended pregnancies. Our work highlights the need to incorporate these mechanisms into future research.	4	Kelly Musick; Paula England; Sarah Edgington; Nicole Kangas

Social Forces	2009	18	This article focuses on three Countries with distinct policies toward motherhood and work: Germany, Sweden and the United States. We analyze the length of mothers' time Out Of paid work after childbirth and the short-term career consequences for mothers. In the United States, we identify a career punishment even for short time-out periods; long time-out periods increase the risk of a downward move and reduce the chances of an upward move. In Germany, long time-out periods destabilize the career and, the longer the leave, the greater the risk of either an upward or downward move. In Sweden, we find a negative effect of time Out on upward moves. Hence, even in ``woman-friendly' Sweden, women's career prospects are better if they return to paid work sooner rather than later.	3	Silke Aisenbrey; Marie Evertsson; Daniela Grunow
Carnabuci, Gianluca & Jeroen Bruggeman. 2009. 'Knowledge Specialization, Knowledge Brokerage and the Uneven Growth of Technology Domains.' Social Forces. 88:2 607-641.	Social Forces	2009	4	Why do certain domains of knowledge grow fast while others grow slowly or stagnate? Two distinct theoretical arguments hold that knowledge growth is enhanced by knowledge specialization and knowledge brokerage. Based on the notion of recombinant knowledge growth, we show that Specialization and brokerage arc opposing modes of knowledge generation, the difference between them lying in the extent to which homogeneous vs. heterogeneous input ideas get creatively recombined. Accordingly, we investigate how both modes of knowledge generation can enhance the growth of technology domains. To address this question, we develop an argument that reconciles both specialization and brokerage into a dynamic explanation. Our contention is that specializing in art increasingly homogeneous set of input ideas is both more efficient and less risky than brokering knowledge. Nevertheless, specializing implies progressively exhausting available recombinant possibilities, while brokerage creates new ones. Hence, technology domains tend to grow faster when they specialize, but the more specialized they become, the more they need knowledge brokerage to grow. We cast Out: Our argument into five hypotheses that predict how growth rates vary across technology domains.	2	Gianluca Carnabuci; Jeroen Bruggeman
Ignatow, Gabriel. 2009. 'Culture and Embodied Cognition: Moral Discourses in Internet Support Groups for Overeaters.' Social Forces. 88:2 643-669.	Social Forces	2009	6	This article argues that a modified version of Bourdieu's habitus concept can generate insights into moral Culture and the ways people use culture to make changes in their lives. If revised in light of recent findings from cognitive neuroscience, the habitus allows for the analysis of culture as embodied cognitive structures linking individuals to primary-group discourses. To demonstrate the utility of this conception, I examine the unique abstract language and embodied metaphors used by members of religious and secular overeaters' internet Support groups. The religious group used far more cleanliness metaphors, and members who made frequent use of such metaphors remained with. the group longer and posted more messages. This effect was not found for either group's abstract language or for the secular group's embodied metaphors. The findings suggest chat a Cultural influence on social bonding can be shown when Culture is operationalized in terms of embodied cognitive schemas that operate within both the habitus and group discourses. Also, traditionally religious moral culture may be more strongly associated with Cultural coherence and social bonding than is modernist culture.	1	Gabriel Ignatow

Using participant observation, interviews and network analysis of the Spring/Summer 2007 Fashion Week collecdons, we explain how producers select models for fashion shows. While fashion producers conceive of their selection of models as a matter of ``taste,'' or personal preference, we find that their decisions are shaped by information sharing mechanism,,; in social networks, principally through a mechanism known as ``optioning,'' which enables producers to know each others' preferences and to align themselves with similar status actors. For cultural producers, choices are a matter of strategic status considerations, even as they are expressed as a matter of personal taste.	2	Frederic C. Godart; Ashley Mears

Social Forces	2009	3	This research compares representations of rap music with the self-reported criminal behavior and resistant attitudes of the Musics core audience. Our database is a large sample of Toronto high school Students (n = 3,393) from which we identify a group of listeners, whose combination of musical likes and dislikes distinguish them as rap univores. W then examine the relationship between their cultural preference for rap music and involvement in a Culture of crime and their perceptions of social injustice and inequity. We find that the rap univores, also known as urban music enthusiasts, report significantly more delinquent behavior and stronger feelings of inequity and injustice than listeners with other musical tastes. However, we also find that the nature and strengths of those relationships vary according to the racial identity of different groups within urban music enthusiasts. Black and white subgroups align themselves with resistance representations while Asians do not; whites and Asians report significant involvement in crime and delinquency, while blacks do not. Finally, we discuss our findings in light of research on media effects and audience reception, youth Subcultures and post-subcultural analysis, and the sociology Of Cultural consumption.	3	Julian Tanner; Mark Asbridge; Scot Wortley

Social Forces	2009	6	Domestic violence continues to be a serious problem for women in the United States. As a result, the battered women's movement has been Tireless in campaigning for greater awareness of the issue, tougher penalties against offenders, and public vigilance against potential batterers, including fathers from dissolving families. In reaction to this stance, a small but vocal countermovement composed of activists in the fathers' rights movement has argued that the BWM is guilty of what I term enemy boundary creep, a perception whereby these men maintain that they have been inappropriately targeted. Using 40 in-depth interviews with fathers' rights activists located across the country, this article details the narrative that these men have composed as to why the BWM is expanding the scope of its enemies, the tactics that the BWM is using in this campaign, and the insidious effects that these efforts are having on fathers across the Country. This narrative formulates a boundary-push back response. This analysis thus articulates how an Unlikely countermovement can use the accusation of enemy boundary creep by its social movement opponents in an effort to shift the political discourse on a significant public problem.	1	Jocelyn Elise Crowley

Results show that neighborhood violence is a strong predictor of both outcomes, net of individual, family, community and school controls. Neighborhood violence accounts for almost half the conditional association between neighborhood disadvantage and high school graduation among males and almost all of the association among females. Violence also accounts for about a fifth of the conditional association between disadvantage and teenage pregnancy among adolescents of both genders. Violence is a critical social characteristic of disadvantaged neighborhoods, one that explains a sizable portion of the effects of growing LIP in such neighborhoods.	1	David J. Harding

The analysis provides evidence against sweeping claims that colonialism is a universal cause of civil violence but finds that some forms of colonialism increase the risk of some forms of civil violence. Specifically, the findings support claims that inter-communal violence is a common legacy of colonialism-especially of British colonialism and colonialism by minor colonial powers-but suggest that a history of colonialism has only a limited impact on political rebellion and civil war.	2	Matthew Lange; Andrew Dawson

Relying on nationally representative data to examine the salaries of lawyers working fulltime in private practice, we find a gender gap of about 5 percent. Identifying four mechanisms-work profiles, opportunity paths and structures, credentials, and legal markets-we first estimate how Much of the gap stems from the differential valuation of women's endowments; second, we estimate the effects of different endowments for men and women; and third we assess both these possibilities. The analyses indicate that none of these mechanisms can fully account for the gender gap. Experimental studies that indicate womens work is less valued and rewarded than men's suggest new directions for research on gendered compensation.	3	Ronit Dinovitzer; Nancy Reichman; Joyce Sterling

Social Forces	2009	13	Occupations with a greater share of females pay less than those with a lower share, controlling for education and skill. This association is explained by two dominant views: devaluation and queuing. The former views the pay offered in art occupation to affect its female proportion, due to employers' preference for men-a gendered labor queue. The latter argues that the proportion of females in an occupation affects pay, owing to devaluation of work done by women. Only a few past studies used longitudinal data, which is needed to test the theories. We use fixed-effects models, thus controlling for stable characteristics Of Occupations, and U.S. Census data from 1950 through 2000. We find substantial evidence for the devaluation view, but only scant evidence for the queuing view.	3	Asaf Levanon; Paula England; Paul Allison

Social Forces	2009	9	This study examines the economic returns to schooling acquired in the country of origin and the Country of destination. It uses large-scale Survey data oil Turkish, Moroccan, Surinamese and Antillean immigrants in the Netherlands, which contain direct measures of pre- and post-migration schooling. It is studied whether the returns to origin-country schooling depend on contextual factors: i.e., immigrant group and the region of living. Furthermore, we examine the importance of host-country schooling for labor market outcomes and if these can be partly explained by increasing contacts with natives. Results show that the returns to origin-country schooling are higher for Surinamese and Antillean immigrants (i.e., those originating from former Dutch colonies) than for immigrants from Turkey and Morocco. The returns to origin-country schooling are not affected by ethnic concentration in the region of living. Finally, it appears that the returns to host-country schooling are much larger than to origin-country schooling, and the higher returns to host-country schooling cannot be explained by increased social contacts with natives.	2	Agnieszka Kanas; Frank Tubergen
Marks, Gary. 2009. 'Modernization Theory and Changes Over Time in the Reproduction of Socioeconomic Inequalities in Australia.' Social Forces. 88:2 917-944.	Social Forces	2009	3	Modernization theory argues that, as societies industrialize and further develop, the influence of social background and other ascribed characteristics on educational and socioeconomic Outcomes declines, while achievement in the education system becomes more important. The purpose of this research is to investigate propositions derived from modernization theory as they apply to Australian society during the second half of the 2 0,h century. Specifically, these are (1. declines in the influence of socioeconomic background on education, occupation and earnings; (2. increases in the occupational and economic returns to education; and (3. decreases in gender inequalities in all three outcomes. These propositions are examined using data from nationally representative surveys conducted from 1965 through 2005. In accordance with modernization theory, it was found that the effects of socioeconomic background on education, occupational attainment and earnings have declined. Gender inequalities in education have been reversed, and the gender gap in earnings has declined. The effect of education on occupational attainment has increased more strongly among men than women. Contrary to expectations from one interpretation of modernization theory, the returns in earnings from education have not increased.	1	Gary N. Marks
McAdam, Doug & Cynthia Brandt. 2009. 'Assessing the Effects of Voluntary Youth Service: the Case of Teach for America.' Social Forces. 88:2 945-969.	Social Forces	2009	10	We use survey data from A accepted applicants to Teach for America 1993-98 to assess the longer-term effect Of Youth service on participants' current civic attitudes and behaviors. While TFA ``graduates'' score higher than the two comparison groups-''dropouts'' and ``non-matriculants''-on a broad range of attitudinal items measuring civic commitment, these differences appear to be less a byproduct of the TFA experience than a reflection of current involvement with the TFA organization. Moreover, the attitudinal differences are not reflected in actual civic behavior. Specifically, graduates lag behind non-matriculants in current service activity and generally trail both non-matriculauts and drop-OutS in self-reported participation in five other forms of civic/political activity measured in the study. Graduates also vote at lower rates than the other two groups. Finally, fewer graduates report employment in ``pro-social'' jobs than either non-matriculants or drop-outs. We close by speculating on what mechanisms may help explain variation in the long-term effects of youth service or activist experiences.	2	Doug McAdam; Cynthia Brandt
Orloff, Ann & Bruno Palier. 2009. 'the Power of Gender Perspectives: Feminist Influence on Policy Paradigms, Social Science, and Social Politics.' Social Politics. 16:4 405-412.	Social Politics	2009	6	Feminist scholarship changed the study of welfare states; influential policy experts have taken off from the feminist critique, incorporating it as they crafted their own social investment strategy, (mis-)translating (and transforming) feminist arguments into an economic rationale. Social science mattered as well: it helped to create a new policy paradigm that is influential across a number of political spaces. Public policy analysis thus needs to pay attention to intellectual processes, emphasizing the role of knowledge in politics; in policy-making, there is puzzling, not only powering. But nobody masters her ideas, or her political actions: actors can deploy ``frames,'' or discourses, but cannot control what happens to them politically.	2	Ann Shola Orloff; Bruno Palier
Padamsee, Tasleem. 2009. 'Culture in Connection: Re-contextualizing Ideational Processes in the Analysis of Policy Development.' Social Politics. 16:4 413-445.	Social Politics	2009	21	Recent scholarship on ideational dynamics in policy development has yielded a deeper understanding of policy-making processes previously illuminated by interest- and institution-based analyses, and even more importantly, a newfound ability to account for processes and outcomes those prior approaches failed to explain. Gender scholars have made particularly strong contributions to the case that we cannot understand policy development without its cultural determinants. This new scholarship has laid a solid foundation for approaching culture, ideas, and discourses as constitutive elements of social policy, and we must now move forward to situate these causal arguments within a broader picture of policy development. This article explores four points of connection that help re-position these processes within the larger endeavor of understanding social policy formation. These are: (a) interaction between ideational and other causal dynamics, (b) the interdependence of these processes and its implications for notions of causality in policy analysis, (c) the ways contemporaneous meanings are connected with one another, which reflects the multiplicity of cultures, ideas, and discourses, and (d) the connections between these meanings and discourses across time, which are critical to instances of significant policy change. Each section also explores the empirical and theoretical scholarship on gender that helps illustrate the need to examine these connections.	1	Tasleem J. Padamsee
Jenson, Jane. 2009. 'Lost in Translation: the Social Investment Perspective and Gender Equality.' Social Politics. 16:4 446-483.	Social Politics	2009	28	The social investment perspective is replacing standard neoliberalism in Latin America as well as Europe. With it come ideas about social citizenship that reconfigure the citizenship regimes of the three regions. The responsibility mix is equilibrated to give a greater role for the state, although as investor rather than spender; access to citizenship rights shifts to incorporate the excluded and marginalized; and governance practices alter to emphasize decentralization to the local and the community. The main idea of the social investment perspective is that the future must be assured by investing in children and ending the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage. With this set of child-centered policy ideas, the equality claims of adult women and attention to their needs are sidelined in favor of those of children, including girls.	1	Jane Jenson
Knijn, Trudie & Arnoud Smit. 2009. 'Investing, Facilitating, or Individualizing the Reconciliation of Work and Family Life: Three Paradigms and Ambivalent Policies1.' Social Politics. 16:4 484-518.	Social Politics	2009	11	After decades of promoting work-family reconciliation with the aim of advancing gender equality, European Union (EU) discourses around work and family have been reframed. This article distinguishes three currently paramount discourses: The social investment approach, the transitional labor market model, and the individual life-course model. Respectively, they propose investing in, facilitating, and individualizing the new social risks, including the resolution of tensions in the relationship between work and family life. Each has particular assumptions about risk-sharing, public and private responsibility, and the position of the individual vis-a-vis the state and the community. These paradigms have been analyzed in relation to EU policies on the reconciliation of work and family life. We find some traces of these paradigms in the Lisbon agreements, its amendments, and in the National Action Plans that are regularly submitted by the member-states. We conclude that the gender-equality agenda has been subordinated to the focus on creating competitive knowledge-based economies in the EU. Social investment is the most prominent of the three paradigms in this new agenda, yet because it is mixed up with elements from the other paradigms, current policy agendas lack coherence.	2	Trudie Knijn; Arnoud Smit
Stryker, Robin & Pamela Wald. 2009. 'Redefining Compassion to Reform Welfare: How Supporters of 1990s Us Federal Welfare Reform Aimed for the Moral High Ground.' Social Politics. 16:4 519-557.	Social Politics	2009	7	We use historical and content/discourse analyses to examine how the abstract, general value of compassion shaped debate over the 1996 Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA), ending entitlement to need-based public assistance in the United States. We find that a taken-for-granted compassionate American identity institutionalized as a social safety net helped constrain debate over ending entitlement, even as women's labor force participation and neo-liberal discourses were rising. But in the mid-1990s, Republican supporters of radical reform converted constraint into opportunity, redefining compassion to make it a positive resource for ending entitlement. Compassion so redefined conjoined with perversity rhetoric and negative attributions about welfare recipients to construct a moral map and logically coherent symbolic package promoting entitlement's end. ``Conservative'' US welfare reform, like ``liberal'' US affirmative action, is a case of policy and institutional change promoted through value redefinition. Multiple perspectives on the role of ideas, including background and foreground, and instrumental and constitutive, combine to explain why Republican leaders perceived the need to redefine compassion, and to account for the content and pattern of frames invoking compassion by Democrats and Republicans in Congressional debates over the PRWORA.	2	Robin Stryker; Pamela Wald
Beland, Daniel. 2009. 'Gender, Ideational Analysis, and Social Policy.' Social Politics. 16:4 558-581.	Social Politics	2009	15	An increasing number of social scientists have argued that ideational processes can have major consequences on politics and policy. Focusing on social policy, the present article explains how students of gender have contributed to the contemporary literature on ideational processes. As suggested, all researchers interested in these processes would benefit from engaging with the gender literature because it draws our attention to at least three broad issues neglected by many non-feminist scholars: (i) the intersection between categorical inequalities and policy ideas; (ii) the role of identities and gendered cultural assumptions; and (iii) the relationship between welfare regimes and ideational processes. Overall, the main objective of this article is to favor a more fruitful dialogue between students of gender, on one hand, and other policy scholars who also explore the role of ideational processes, on the other.	1	Daniel Beland
Lee, Jooyoung. 2009. 'Escaping Embarrassment: Face-work in the Rap Cipher.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 72:4 306-324.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	6	How do individuals escape embarrassing moments in interaction? Drawing from ethnographic fieldwork, in-depth interviews, and video recordings of weekly street corner ciphers (impromptu rap sessions), this paper expands Goffman's theory of defensive and protective face-work. The findings reveal formulaic and indirect dimensions of face-work. First, this paper shows how individuals use prescripted techniques and other canned resources to overcome embarrassing gaffes in interaction. Specifically, rappers use ``writtens'' (prewritten rhymes) when they are close to ``falling off,'' a local term for messing up and stopping abruptly during a ``freestyle'' (improvised) rap performance. Second this paper describes how shared pressures to sustain an interaction can lead to collateral face-saving. In the cipher, surrounding peers `jump in'' and begin rapping when somebody else falls off. Although this protects the person who is falling off from embarrassment, it is often done to ``keep the flow going'' in the cipher At the end, this paper also outlines situations in which individuals with hold face protection from others. These findings point to other social situations in which individuals escape embarrassment with canned resources and through collateral face-saving.	1	Jooyoung Lee
Whitehead, Kevin. 2009. '``categorizing the Categorizer'': the Management of Racial Common Sense in Interaction.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 72:4 325-342.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	10	In this paper, I consider one mechanism by which racial categories, racial ``common sense,'' and thus the social organization of race itself are reproduced in interaction. I approach these issues by using an ethnomethodological, conversation analytic approach to analyze a range of practices employed by participants of a ``race-training'' workshop. These practices manage the normative accountability involved in referring to the racial categories of others when describing their actions, and thus in using racial common sense in talk-in-interaction. This accountability arises in part because a speaker use of a racial category to explain someone else's actions may provide a warranted basis for recipients to treat the speaker own racial category as relevant for understanding and assessing the speaker actions. I describe three main ways in which speakers can manage this accountability, namely generalizing race, localizing race, and alluding to race. My analysis shows that, even in attempting to resist racial common sense in accounting for their own actions and those of others, speakers orient to race as a normative framework according to which individuals will produce their own actions and interpret those of others, and thus reproduce it as relevant for understanding social action. This research contributes to advancing knowledge in the fields of ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, racial studies, and categorical inequality.	1	Kevin A. Whitehead

Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	0	The effects of cities on the subjective states of individuals have been the subject of continuous inquiry. Recent research has demonstrated potential links between immediate environments and individual outcomes such as perceived powerlessness. However the results of such studies are inconsistent and fail to account for the greater societal environment in which observations occur. Using a more comparative, cross-national sample and multi-level modeling, we retest the expectation that the immediate physical and social environment influences feelings of powerlessness, and extend the test to consider urbanism operating at societal levels beyond the local. Controlling for demographic composition, we find that urban factors operating at both societal and local levels are important predictors of set(efficacy and powerlessness. While one factor was found to correspond with decreased se (efficacy, two aspects of urban environments-one local and one societal-are found to be consistent with Simmel's assertion that urban settings increase individual feelings of efficacy and freedom. The implications of these findings for urban theory are discussed.	2	Jeffrey S. Debies-Carl; Christopher M. Huggins
Gheorghiu, Mirona, Vivian Vignoles & Peter Smith. 2009. 'Beyond the United States and Japan: Testing Yamagishi's Emancipation Theory of Trust Across 31 Nations.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 72:4 365-383.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	16	We examined the relationship between Individualism/Collectivism and generalized social trust across 31 European nations participating in the European Social Survey. Using multi-level regression analyses, the current study provides the first empirical investigation of the effects of cultural norms of Individualism/Collectivism on generalized social trust while accounting for individuals' own cultural orientations within the same analysis. The results provide clear support for Yamagishi and Yamagishi (1994) emancipation theory of trust, showing a significant and positive relationship between Individualism/Collectivism and generalized social trust, over and above the effect of a country political history of communism and ethnic heterogeneity. Having controlled for individual effects of Individualism/Collectivism it is clear that the results of the current analysis cannot be reduced to an individual-level explanation, but must be interpreted within the context Of macrosocial processes. We conclude by discussing potential mechanisms that could explain why national individualism is more likely to foster trust among people than collectivism.	3	Mirona A. Gheorghiu; Vivian L.

Schaefer, David & Olga Kornienko. 2009. 'Building Cohesion in Positively Connected Exchange Networks.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 72:4 384-402.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2009	4	This research investigates the process through which individuals build cohesive relationships in positively connected exchange relations. Positive connections exist any time exchange in one relation must precede exchange in another Such situations arise through gatekeeping, in generalized exchange contexts, and when resources diffuse across a network. Prior exchange research has focused primarily on negative connections, whose defining feature is competition, leaving theoretical understanding of cohesion-building in positive connections relatively underdeveloped. A key feature of positive connections is that unlike negative connections, they allow actors to exchange often even if their relationship is power-imbalanced. Consequently, we propose that in positive connections, structural power affects cohesion primarily through the mediating effects of power use and emotions, but not through exchange frequency and uncertainty. Results of a laboratory experiment support this causal model and enhance our understanding of the distinctive processes operating in positive connections.	2	David A. Schaefer; Olga Kornienko

Social Science Research	2009	12	Child obesity is a public health priority with numerous and complex causes. This study focuses on factors within the family, namely stressful experiences, which may be associated with child obesity. We examine data from the Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics for children in two age groups: 5-11 and 12-17 years old. Results from an ordered probit regression model of child weight categorizations (healthy weight, overweight, obese) indicate positive associations between a range of family stressors (lack of cognitive stimulation and emotional support in the household among younger children, and mental and physical health problems and financial strain in the household among older children) and child overweight and obesity. We discuss how public policies that reduce family stressors may, in turn, help reduce child obesity.	5	Steven Garasky; Susan D. Stewart; Craig Gundersen; Brenda J. Lohman; Joey C. Eisenmann

I then analyze the effects these attitudes have on mathematics achievement test scores. Compared to the earlier group, students in the later cohort were less likely to indicate academic reasons for attending school and largely perceived their friends as being less engaged academically. Students in both cohorts whose friends held academic values experienced an increase in math scores. The more students in the earlier cohort disagreed that they came to school for academic reasons, the more their math scores decreased; this relationship did not appear for the later cohort. Females in each cohort showed stronger academic attitudes than males; additionally, believing that popularity was important was associated with lower test scores for females, but not males, in the Millennial cohort.	1	Susan A.

Social Science Research	2009	4	Is the homogenous grouping of students by ability conducive to learning for all students alike, or does it affect students of different ability levels differently? To address this question, I compare the distributions of math performance for students between Grade 8 and Grade 4 across countries with different levels of between-classroom ability grouping, controlling for country-level unobserved heterogeneity using a fixed-effects model. Homogeneous grouping, relative to heterogeneous grouping, is found to have no significant impact on mean performance, but it does increase performance inequality by benefiting the high achievers at the expense of the low achievers.	1	Min-Hsiung Huang
Martin, Lauren. 2010. 'Anticipating Infertility Egg Freezing, Genetic Preservation, and Risk.' Gender \& Society. 24:4 526-545.	Gender \& Society	2010	6	This article discusses the new reproductive technology of egg freezing in the context of existing literature on gender, medicalization, and infertility. What is unique about this technology is its use by women who are not currently infertile but who may anticipate a future diagnosis. This circumstance gives rise to a new ontological category of ``anticipated infertility.'' The author draws on participant observation and a qualitative analysis of scientific, mainstream, and marketing literature to identify and compare the representation of two different candidates for egg freezing: women with cancer and healthy young women. Although both populations experience anticipated infertility, their dichotomous portrayals as appropriate candidates are demonstrative of gender norms linking women to motherhood. Egg freezing is a concise illustration of how the medicalization of women's bodies and bodily processes masks a host of cultural anxieties about aging, illness, reproduction, and risk.	1	Lauren Jade Martin
Finley, Nancy. 2010. 'Skating Femininity: Gender Maneuvering in Women's Roller Derby.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 39:4 359-387.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	7	This article contributes to the discussion of hegemonic and alternative femininities through an ethnographic study of Women's Flat Track Roller Derby.As a site for construction of alternative femininities in the image of a ``derby girl,'' derby reveals how the understudied intragender relations between femininities can be important in challenging hegemonic gender relations.The dynamics between femininities, and the women who practice them, affect the motivations for challenging hegemonic gender, the transportation of symbolic discourses deployed in the challenges, and the creation of new organizational networks to sustain these challenges. One sees these effects in the organized ways the athletes feminize their participation in an aggressive sport through resistance, adaptation, mockery, and parody of hegemonic femininity, pariah femininities, and sport.This study gives particular attention to the interpretation of the events by the skaters and the histories of the social actors as well the interactions in the collective.	1	Nancy J.

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	0	This article reports the case of a young military police officer who murdered his fiancee. The dominant wisdom is that men kill their female partners as an expression of their power and control or because their power and control is ebbing. Employing a sociological imagination and Avery Gordon's notion of haunting, the author draws on feminist and social psychological discourses to highlight the contextual importance of the power relations of gender and the central role of shame and humiliated fury in the killing. The contextual importance of power relations and the central role of shame and humiliated fury constitute necessary but not sufficient conditions for the commission of intimate-partner homicide because such killings also involve inexplicable forces. The author discusses some of the practical and theoretical implications of the findings.	1	Neil Websdale

It uses a case study of one theoretical idea refined through ethnographic fieldwork-Phil Strong's (1979; 1988) work on Erving Goffman's theory of cerennony.The article argues that Strong effectively applied Goffman's ideas to different settings and successfully extended Goffman's ideas on ceremony. In doing so, Strong demonstrated how ethnography can be more productive in developing theoretical ideas, but this productivity relied on his personal enthusiasm for theory and fieldwork. Strong's theoretical empiricism provides an exemplar of how theory and conceptual refinement can grow as a result of doing ethnography the right way.	1	Sam Hillyard
Borchard, Kurt. 2010. 'Between Poverty and a Lifestyle: the Leisure Activities of Homeless People in Las Vegas.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 39:4 441-466.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	1	Housed people judge homeless people, and in particular their leisure activities, as indicators of whether that person has chosen a ``homeless lifestyle'' and therefore deserves homelessness. To achieve a more complex understanding of contemporary homelessness, the author conducted ethnographic fieldwork over ten months in Las Vegas, Nevada, interviewing and participant observing dozens of homeless men and women, including observations of their leisure activities and ``free time.'' The author argues that homeless people's pursuit of leisure activities helps explain the popularity of both Las Vegas as a destination for homeless people and why it is a difficult place for homeless people to end their poverty. A consideration of homeless people's lifestyles in such a postmodern tourist environment also shows how such environments both sustain homeless people and produce homelessness.	1	Kurt Borchard

Topics include union formation, fertility, spousal roles, marital satisfaction and conflict, divorce, domestic violence, infidelity, pregnancy, parenting children, parenting adolescents, and coping with family distress. Conclusions emphasize moving beyond markers of general religiousness and identifying specific spiritual beliefs and practices that prevent or intensify problems in traditional and nontraditional families.	1	Annette Mahoney

Some research suggests that families may be more powerful than schools in promoting child and adolescent well-being. Additional research is needed to more fully understand how capital across institutions interacts in producing child well-being, when and why multiple institutions or levels of analysis are relevant, and how several contexts can form chains of causation. Theories of social capital may promote increased conversation among researchers who study the same outcomes yet focus their analyses on different contexts.	3	Toby L. Parcel; Mikaela J.

The coping mechanisms were hypothesized to moderate the relationship between overload and stress. The sample consisted of 1,404 men and 1,623 women in dual-earner families. Respondents relied on 2 coping strategies: scaling back and restructuring family roles. Men were more likely than women to respond to overload by scaling back and less likely to respond by work-role restructuring. Coping by family-role restructuring moderated the relationship between role overload and stress for both groups; however, the gender difference was not significant. Coping by work-role restructuring moderated the relationship between overload and stress only for men.	3	Chris A. Higgins; Linda E. Duxbury; Sean T. Lyons

Using quantitative couple data from The Netherlands Kinship Panel Study (NKPS) (N = 3,016) and semistructured qualitative interviews (N = 34), we found that, for women, schedules with varying hours resulted in greater relationship dissatisfaction than for men. Men with young children who worked varying hours had less relationship conflict and spent more time with children. Parents used nonstandard schedules for tag-team parenting or to maintain perceptions of full-time motherhood. The lack of negative effects, particularly for night shifts, suggests that previous findings-largely U.S. ones-are not universal and may be attributed to wider cultural, industrial relations, and economic contexts.	2	Melinda Mills; Kadri Taht

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	8	This article focuses on the problems faced by dual-earner partnerships arising from the regional coordination of the partners' careers. It is still unknown whether the fact that couples are less mobile than singles is caused by homogeneous preferences within couples or by a process of balancing conflicting interests. Consequently, we analyze the potential conflicts provoked by work-related migration incentives. We test hypotheses derived from bargaining theory using quasi-experimental data from a factorial survey of nearly 280 European couples. Our results support the bargaining approach and confirm that asymmetrical shifts in bargaining power drive the potential for conflict. Women's willingness to move is generally less than men's, but the impact of employment prospects differs only slightly by gender.	3	Martin Abraham; Katrin Auspurg; Thomas Hinz

Comparing matched survey and divorce certificate information from the 1995 Life Events and Satisfaction Study (N = 1,811) showed that nonresponse error is responsible for the majority of the error in divorce data. Misreporting the divorce event was rare, and more than two thirds of respondents provided a divorce date within 6 months of the actual date. Nevertheless, divorce date error attenuated effects of time since divorce on outcomes. Gender, child custody, marital history, and education were associated with divorce error.	1	Colter Mitchell

For first marriages, cohabiting with the spouse without first being engaged or married was associated with more negative interaction, higher self-reported divorce proneness, and a greater probability of divorce compared to cohabiting after engagement or marriage (with patterns in the same direction for marital positivity). In contrast, there was a general risk associated with premarital cohabitation for second marriages on self-reported indices of marital quality, with or without engagement when cohabitation began.	5	Scott M.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	4	Despite progress in identifying the covariates of divorce, there remain substantial gaps in the knowledge. One of these gaps is the relationship between health and risk of marital dissolution. I extend prior research by examining the linkages between work-related health limitations and divorce using 25 years of data (N = 7919) taken from the 1979 National Longitudinal Study of Youth (NLSY-79). I found that work-related health limitations among husbands, but not wives, were linked to an increased risk of divorce. In addition, I found that this relationship was moderated by education in a fashion that varies according to race. For White men, education exacerbated the effect of health limitations, but for Black men, education attenuated the effects of work-related health limitations.	1	Jay Teachman

Current accounts focus on changes to family finances, destabilized parenting practices, elevated parental conflict, and deterioration of the parent-child relationship, to explain the impact of divorce. A less studied explanation draws attention to children's diminished psychosocial well-being following divorce. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten cohort (ECLS-K) (N = 10,061), I examined the role of psychosocial well-being in the relationship between divorce and children's outcomes. The results suggest that divorce is associated with diminished psychosocial well-being in children, and that this decrease helps explain the connection between divorce and lower academic achievement.	1	Daniel Potter

Multinomial and logistic regression models indicated that children living in grandparent-headed households experience elevated risk of health insecurity (as measured by receipt of public insurance and uninsurance)-a disproportionate risk given rates of poverty within those households. Children living with single parents did not share this substantial risk. Risk of food and housing insecurity did not differ significantly from 2-parent households once characteristics of the household and caregivers were taken into account.	2	Lindsey A. Baker; Jan E.

Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:4 963-975.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	9	A substantial body of research has shown that relationship quality tends to be (a) lower among racial and ethnic minorities and (b) higher among more religious persons and among couples in which partners share common religious affiliations, practices, and beliefs. However, few studies have examined the interplay of race or ethnicity and religion in shaping relationship quality. Our study addresses this gap in the literature using data from the National Survey of Religion and Family Life (NSRFL), a 2006 telephone survey of 2,400 working-age adults (ages 18-59), which contains oversamples of African Americans and Latinos. Results underscore the complex nature of the effects of race and ethnicity, as well as religious variables. In particular, we found that couples' in-home family devotional activities and shared religious beliefs are positively linked with reports of relationship quality.	3	Christopher G. Ellison; Amy M.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	1	This study examined the potential for educational investments in Mexican immigrant mothers to enhance their management of their children's pathways through the educational system in the United States, which often disadvantages them. We tested this hypothesis with data on 816 Mexican immigrant women and their children from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K). The results suggest that mothers who pursued their own schooling over a 4-year period, regardless of whether they obtained a degree, increased their engagement with their children's schools during that same period.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	0	This study examined associations between Mexican-origin spouses' conflict resolution strategies (i.e., nonconfrontation, solution orientation, and control) and (a) gender-typed qualities and attitudes, (b) cultural orientations, and (c) marital quality in a sample of 227 couples. Results of multilevel modeling revealed that Mexican cultural orientations were positively associated with solution orientation, and Anglo cultural orientations were negatively associated with nonconfrontation. Expressive personal qualities were negatively associated with control, whereas instrumental qualities were positively related to control. Links between conflict resolution and marital quality revealed that control and nonconfrontation were associated with spouses' ratings of marital negativity. In some cases, different patterns emerged for husbands and wives. Discussion highlights the role of culture and gender dynamics in marital relationships.	3	Lorey A. Wheeler; Kimberly A.

'Older Parent-child Relationships in Six Developed Nations: Comparisons at the Intersection of Affection and Conflict.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:4 1006-1021.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	13	Intergenerational solidarity and ambivalence paradigms suggest that emotional relationships between generations consist of both positive and negative sentiments. We applied latent class analysis to measures of affection and conflict in 2,698 older parent-child relationships in 6 developed nations: England, Germany, Israel, Norway, Spain, and the United States (Southern California). The best fitting model consisted of 4 latent classes distributed differently across nations but with a cross-nationally invariant measurement structure. After controlling for demographics, health, coresidence, contact, and support, the following classes were overrepresented in corresponding nations: amicable (England), detached (Germany and Spain), disharmonious (United States), ambivalent (Israel). We discuss policy and cultural differences across societies that may explain why the prevalence of particular emotional types varied by nation.	5	Merril Silverstein; Daphna Gans; Ariela Lowenstein; Roseann Giarrusso; Vern L.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	12	Using administrative data on all adult children living in The Netherlands age 30-40 and their parents (N = 1,999,700), we investigated the extent to which situations and events associated with the support needs and privacy needs of either generation determine intergenerational coresidence and the transition to coresidence. Logistic and multinomial logistic regression analyses showed that both generations' support needs increased the likelihood of coresidence and of a move of the generation in need into the other's home. Turning to privacy needs, we found that coresidence and the transition to coresidence was less likely when a partner or stepparent was present and more likely when the adult child was a never-married single parent.	3	Annika Smits; Ruben I.

Nagel, Ineke, Marie-Louise Damen & Folkert Haanstra. 2010. 'the Arts Course Ckv1 and Cultural Participation in the Netherlands.' Poetics. 38:4 365-385.	Poetics	2010	2	In 1999, the arts course CKV1 (in Dutch) was introduced at middle and higher levels of secondary education in the Netherlands. CKV1, which can be translated as `Cultural and Artistic Education', aims to encourage cultural participation among adolescents by compelling them to attend theatre performances, concerts, museums, exhibitions, etc. This article examines whether enrolment in the course affects cultural participation and attitudes towards the arts 2-6 years after the students have completed the course. Data were used on three cohorts of secondary school students who took part in a classroom interview at the age of 14-17, and who participated in follow-up surveys 2,4 and 6 years later. The eldest cohort was interviewed just before CKV1 was introduced to the secondary school curriculum and the two youngest cohorts were interviewed once the course was underway. Furthermore, being a panel study, the dataset contains observations of cultural participation before, during and after enrolment in CKV1. The results demonstrate that CKV1 neither affects the students' cultural participation nor their attitude towards the arts 2-6 years after they have completed the course. The absence of effects applies equally to students who have culturally active and culturally non-active parents.	3	Ineke Nagel; Marie-Louise Damen; Folkert Haanstra
Johanson, Katya. 2010. 'Culture for or by the Child? `children's Culture' and Cultural Policy.' Poetics. 38:4 386-401.	Poetics	2010	2	The concept of a `children's culture' emerged both in the sociology of childhood and some national cultural policies in the 1970s, and has persisted since, although with changing definitions. This article traces the discourses that have shaped and influenced the notion of children's culture in sociology, public policy and specifically in cultural policies. It examines case studies of cultural policy directed at children from the `child-friendly' Nordic nations of Denmark. Norway and Finland. It argues that while children's culture was an invention and beneficiary of the late twentieth-century policy emphasis on cultural democracy, issues such as the extension of rights to children and the perceived threats of globalisation and communications technology have recently caused cultural policy agencies to redefine the role of the state in cultural policies for children.	1	Katya Johanson
Tal-Or, Nurit & Jonathan Cohen. 2010. 'Understanding Audience Involvement: Conceptualizing and Manipulating Identification and Transportation.' Poetics. 38:4 402-418.	Poetics	2010	6	Two central avenues for audience involvement in entertainment are identification and transportation. This study conceptually and empirically differentiated between these processes by manipulating information about the hero of a film and about the plot in order to affect the ways viewers respond to the film and character. The valence of information about the hero affected the level of identification (but not the level of transportation), and the time of deeds affected the level of transportation (but not the level of identification). These results provide evidence that identification and transportation are distinct processes and an analysis of how each of them relates to enjoyment supports this conclusion. Results are discussed in terms of their theoretical and methodological contribution to the study of audience involvement.	2	Nurit Tal-Or; Jonathan Cohen
Sapiro, Gisele. 2010. 'Globalization and Cultural Diversity in the Book Market: the Case of Literary Translations in the Us and in France.' Poetics. 38:4 419-439.	Poetics	2010	9	This paper analyzes the effects of globalization in the book market from the standpoint of linguistic diversity, as assessed by the number of books translated from and into different languages. While the core-periphery model accounts for the global flows of translation, it does not explain the variations within languages according to categories and genres. Using Bourdieu's theory of the field of publishing, this paper compares the market of literary translation in the US and in France. Whereas the pole of large-scale production is dominated by the English language, the pole of small-scale production developed in both countries a strategy of resistance by translating literary works from an increasing number of languages, as a claim in favour of cultural diversity.	1	Gisele Sapiro
Westoff, Charles & Emily Marshall. 2010. 'Hispanic Fertility, Religion and Religiousness in the Us.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:4 441-452.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	3	Is the higher fertility of Hispanics in the United States due to their religion and/or to their greater religiousness? Evidence from national survey data indicates no difference in fertility between Protestant and Catholic Hispanic women but Hispanics are more religious than non-Hispanics in terms of the perceived importance of religion in their personal lives. Religiousness is associated with higher fertility but Hispanic fertility is higher than non-Hispanic fertility regardless of religion or religiousness. Ethnic differences in education and income in turn are more important for fertility than the religious dimension.	2	Charles F. Westoff; Emily A. Marshall

Population Research and Policy Review. 29:4 453-479.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	2	Using Maryland administrative data between 1996 and 2005, this paper examines the impact of local labor market conditions on work and welfare use among single mothers. Our estimates rely on the new Census Bureau Quarterly Workforce Indicators database, which provides county-level economic indicators filtered by industry, gender, and age-group. We specify a multinomial choice model to estimate the effects of these local labor market variables on the full set of work-welfare combinations. The results indicate that lower unemployment rates and increased new hires and new hires' earnings in key industries increase the likelihood that women choose alternatives that include work. African American women and those with fewer years of education respond differently to changing economic conditions. Our results are robust to controls for fixed effects, county-specific time trends, and endogenous migration.	2	Chris M. Herbst; David W. Stevens

Population Research and Policy Review	2010	0	With data drawn from the second public release version of the ``Survey of Health, Aging and Retirement in Europe'' (SHARE), we scrutinize individual and contextual (regional) correlates of economic difficulties among older Europeans, aged 65 or more. A logistic multi-level regression model with random intercept shows that the risk of being relatively poor varies considerably among the aged. We verified that the factors affecting poverty in each area are not merely the weighted sum of the effect of the more disadvantaged people within the same area, which also exists: poverty appears also significantly influenced by the specific context of residence.	2	Daniele Vignoli; Gustavo De
Kim, Jungho & Alexia Prskawetz. 2010. 'External Shocks, Household Consumption and Fertility in Indonesia.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:4 503-526.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	0	This paper examines the impact of idiosyncratic income shocks on household consumption, educational expenditure and fertility in Indonesia, and assesses whether the investment in human capital of children and fertility are used to smooth household consumption. Using four different kinds of self-reported economic hardships, our findings indicate that coping mechanisms are rather efficient for Indonesian households that perceive an economic hardship. Only in case of unemployment do we find a significant decrease in consumption spending and educational expenditure while fertility increases. These results indicate that households that perceive an unemployment shock use children as a means for smoothing consumption. Regarding the death of a household member or natural disaster we find that consumption per person even increases. These results are consistent with the argument that coping mechanisms even over-compensate the actual consumption loss due to an economic hardship. One important lesson from our findings is that different types of income shock may lead to different economic and demographic behavioral adjustments and therefore require specific targeted social insurance programs.	2	Jungho Kim; Alexia Prskawetz
Allen, Heather & Rebecca Katz. 2010. 'Demography and Public Health Emergency Preparedness: Making the Connection.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:4 527-539.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	2	The tools and techniques of population sciences are extremely relevant to the discipline of public health emergency preparedness: protecting and securing the population's health requires information about that population. While related fields such as security studies have successfully integrated demographic tools into their research and literature, the theoretical and practical connection between the methods of demography and the practice of public health emergency preparedness is weak. This article suggests the need to further the interdisciplinary use of demography by examining the need for a systematic use of population science techniques in public health emergency preparedness. Ultimately, we demonstrate how public health emergency preparedness can incorporate demography to develop more effective preparedness plans. Important policy implications emerge: demographers and preparedness experts need to collaborate more formally in order to facilitate community resilience and mitigate the consequences of public health emergencies.	2	Heather Allen; Rebecca Katz
Huyser, Kimberly, Arthur Sakamoto & Isao Takei. 2010. 'the Persistence of Racial Disadvantage: the Socioeconomic Attainments of Single-race and Multi-race Native Americans.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:4 541-568.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	1	Using data from the 2000 U.S. Census, we investigate the schooling and earnings of single-race and multi-race Native Americans. Our analysis distinguishes between Single-Race Native Americans, biracial White Native Americans, biracial Hispanic-White Native Americans, and biracial Black Native Americans. Further differentiating by gender, the results indicate significant variation in socioeconomic attainments across these different Native American groups although almost all of them are in some way disadvantaged relative to non-Hispanic, non-Native American whites. The most disadvantaged group tends to be Single-Race Native Americans who have the lowest levels of schooling as well as lower earnings relative to non-Hispanic, non-Native American whites who are comparable in terms of schooling, age, and other basic demographic characteristics. The results demonstrate notable differentials by the racial/ethnic type of Native American group as well as by gender. In the case of men, all of the Native American groups have clear socioeconomic disadvantages. One contrast is that migration slightly increases the earnings of men but it slightly decreases the earnings of women. We interpret these findings as underscoring how measured socioeconomic differentials between demographic groups are significantly affected by the categorization of race/ethnicity in surveys and by how persons choose to be enumerated in terms of those categories.	3	Kimberly R.

Ishida, Kanako. 2010. 'the Role of Ethnicity in Father Absence and Children's School Enrollment in Guatemala.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:4 569-591.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	0	Despite the historical prevalence of single motherhood in Latin America and its rise in recent years, there is limited knowledge on the magnitude and consequences of father absence as experienced by children. Using a nationally representative sample from the 2002 Guatemalan Reproductive Health Survey, this study provides unprecedented documentation on the national prevalence of children's separate living arrangements from their biological fathers and nonresident fathers' paternity establishment and child support payments. Using random-intercept models, this study further demonstrates that father absence has a negative effect on the school enrollment of indigenous children of both sexes and Ladino male children. Increased poverty in father-absent households explains a smaller proportion of this adverse effect on indigenous children, suggesting that their fathers, when present, play a stronger social, rather than economic, role compared to their Ladino counterparts. Finally, child support payments attenuate the negative effects of father absence, particularly among Ladino male children.	1	Kanako Ishida
Schaake, Karina, Jack Burgers & Clara Mulder. 2010. 'Ethnicity at the Individual and Neighborhood Level as an Explanation for Moving Out of the Neighborhood.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:4 593-608.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	3	We address the influence of both the ethnic composition of the neighborhood and the ethnicity of individual residents on moving out of neighborhoods in the Netherlands. Using the Housing Research Netherlands survey and multinomial logistic regression analyses of moving out versus not moving or moving within the neighborhood, we found that ethnicity at the individual level was not of much importance for moving out. The combination of ethnicity at the individual level and the neighborhood level, however, appeared to be a rather important explanation of geographical mobility. Ethnic minorities are more likely than native Dutch to move within neighborhoods, and less likely to move away from them, as the share of non-western minorities in those neighborhoods increases. Native Dutch move away more frequently than ethnic minorities as the share of non-western ethnic minorities in neighborhoods is greater. These results suggest ethnic enclave formation or place stratification in the Netherlands.	3	Karina Schaake; Jack Burgers; Clara H. Mulder
Walker, Edward & John McCarthy. 2010. 'Legitimacy, Strategy, and Resources in the Survival of Community-based Organizations.' Social Problems. 57:3 315-340.	Social Problems	2010	7	Organizations active in mobilizing low- and moderate-income communities make considerable efforts to combat inequalities and build voice for citizens, despite inherent challenges of obtaining resources, maintaining member interest, and retaining staff. How, then, do such groups remain viable-even thriving-organizations? Building upon research on organizational theory and social movements, we examine patterns of survival among a sample of community-based organizations (CBOs) between 1990 and 2004, thus providing the first systematic study of their long-term mortality processes. More specifically, we test how organizations' sociopolitical legitimacy and resources (and strategies for cultivating both) influence survival, finding that the legitimacy of organizations in low- income areas is a double-edged sword, as embeddedness in resource-deprived local environments confers both benefits and disadvantages. In particular, we find the strongest support for the notion that, beyond the considerable effects of externally obtained resources, CBOs also benefit considerably by engaging in even a small amount of grassroots fundraising. Further, although we find significant effects of extra-local legitimacy in the baseline models-through organizations' affiliation with national or regional organizing networks-we find evidence in additional analyses that the survival benefits of network affiliation are largely mediated by resources. We also find sizable but marginally significant effects of local legitimacy, and significant positive effects of organizational age and urban location. Overall, our findings suggest that although cultivating resources is the surest path to survival, organizations that build their legitimacy will be in a better position to compensate for structural resource deficits.	2	Edward T.

Social Problems. 57:3 341-370.	Social Problems	2010	5	This research adopts a structural identity theory framework to examine post-recruitment activism in the Irish Republican Movement. The data are from members of Provisional Sinn Fein who were first interviewed in the mid-1980s and subsequently reinterviewed in the mid-1990s and the late 2000s. Ten and 20 years after their initial interviews, some respondents were still involved in Provisional Sinn Fein while others had: helped create a rival organization, Republican Sinn Fein, in 1986; helped create another rival organization, the 32 County Sovereignty Movement, in 1997; withdrawn from activism; and withdrawn from and then reentered activism. The interviews show that the decision to exit from activism was primarily motivated by changes in the respondents' personal lives and not for political reasons. For some respondents, life changes brought with them new relationships and new identities that limited their availability for activism and also forced respondents to choose between competing identities. The decision to remain an activist but to create a rival organization was influenced by interaction among subgroups of activists in Provisional Sinn Fein and by the respondents' perception of what is important for Irish Republicanism.	1	Robert W.

Cech, Erin & Mary Blair-Loy. 2010. 'Perceiving Glass Ceilings? Meritocratic Versus Structural Explanations of Gender Inequality Among Women in Science and Technology.' Social Problems. 57:3 371-397.	Social Problems	2010	5	Americans often rely on meritocratic ideologies rather than structural factors to explain unequal labor market outcomes, but we know little about how such beliefs are contingent upon individuals' social locations. Taking advantage of unique survey data, this article examines how gender inequality in professional advancement is explained among successful women professionals in science, technology, and allied fields-an employment arena potentially characterized simultaneously by potent meritocratic ideologies and persistent gendered barriers. Using multinomial logistic regressions comparing structural and meritocratic frames for explaining the paucity of women at high levels, we show how respondents in different career and family circumstances use these conflicting perceptual lenses. We find that married women, those with business education, and those in the top levels of their organizations are more likely to account for gender inequality by invoking deficiencies in women's human capital or motivation, whereas mothers, primary breadwinners, sellers of professional services, and those working in unsupportive organizations are more likely to invoke structural explanations. This research has implications for social action. Successful women's beliefs about gender inequality may influence whether they help remove structural obstacles for other women, or whether, through adherence to the meritocratic ideology, they help reconstruct the glass ceilings they have cracked.	2	Erin A.

Burroway, Rebekah. 2010. 'Schools Against Aids: Secondary School Enrollment and Cross-national Disparities in Aids Death Rates.' Social Problems. 57:3 398-420.	Social Problems	2010	1	Although AIDS is a leading cause of death worldwide, the consequences of the pandemic are remarkably unequally distributed cross-nationally. This unequal global distribution of AIDS deaths should be of interest to sociologists because of the potential role of structural forces in accounting for these disparities. Yet, there has been relatively little sociological research on this topic. Using underutilized cross-national data on AIDS deaths, this study examines the macro-level sources of variation in AIDS death rates across 115 countries. The analysis focuses on secondary school enrollment as a key structural factor in reducing AIDS deaths. After controlling for the prevalence of HIV infection, secondary school enrollment has the second largest and most robust effect on AIDS death rates. Economic development also reduces AIDS death rates, but this effect is mediated by secondary school enrollment. Schooling matters partly because it reduces HIV prevalence, but education still continues to have a significant negative effect on AIDS deaths even after controlling for prevalence. The education effect is robust in a variety of sensitivity analyses. Ultimately, this study underscores the role of structural factors, particularly education, for understanding the AIDS crisis.	1	Rebekah Burroway
Crowley, Martha, Daniel Tope, Lindsey Chamberlain & Randy Hodson. 2010. 'Neo-taylorism at Work: Occupational Change in the Post-fordist Era.' Social Problems. 57:3 421-447.	Social Problems	2010	3	The last quarter of the twentieth century saw an erosion of job security in both manual and professional occupations. In this article, we investigate how the proliferation of employee involvement schemes in manual production and the growth of layoffs, temporary outsourcing, and project-based teams in the professions have influenced working conditions in both manual and professional settings. We argue that these practices represent not a departure from scientific management as is often presumed, but rather adoption of Taylorist principles not fully manifested in Fordist-era mass production. Flexible practices have thus expanded the influence of scientific management in manual work, and extended the scope of its application into the professions in an era perhaps more aptly termed neo-Taylorist than post-Fordist. Using data derived from the population of workplace ethnographies, we evaluate historical shifts in the organization of manual and professional work and outcomes for employees. Our findings support accounts critical of the nature and degree of change in manual jobs and suggest that post-Fordist shifts in the professions have successfully ushered in intensification analogous to what Fordist strategies accomplished in manual work-with unintended negative consequences for workers. Our conclusions point to a general deterioration of conditions in both manual and professional occupations due at least in part to an increasingly rigorous application of the principles of scientific management to both types of work.	4	Martha Crowley; Daniel Tope; Lindsey Joyce Chamberlain; Randy Hodson
Apel, Robert & Gary Sweeten. 2010. 'the Impact of Incarceration on Employment During the Transition to Adulthood.' Social Problems. 57:3 448-479.	Social Problems	2010	8	The research findings with respect to the relationship between incarceration and employment are consistent enough that it is tempting to conclude that incarceration causes deterioration in ex-inmates' employment prospects. Yet, causality remains tenuous for several reasons. For one, studies frequently rely on samples of nonincarcerated subjects that are not truly ``at risk'' of incarceration, which undermines their use as comparison samples and potentially biases estimates of the impact of incarceration on life outcomes. Additionally, even with confidence about causal identification, the field remains ignorant about the precise mechanism by which incarceration erodes employment and earnings. To address these gaps, this study uses the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to estimate the impact of incarceration during late adolescence and early adulthood on short- and long-term employment outcomes. The subjects of interest are all individuals who are convicted of a crime for the first time, some of whom receive a sentence of incarceration following their conviction. Broad measures of legal and illegal employment are used to explore possible avenues by which incarceration affects individual work histories.	2	Robert Apel; Gary Sweeten
Wright, Emily & Michael Benson. 2010. 'Immigration and Intimate Partner Violence: Exploring the Immigrant Paradox.' Social Problems. 57:3 480-503.	Social Problems	2010	11	Recent evidence indicates that contrary to some criminological theories, immigrants are less violent than native-born Americans. The relationship between immigrant status and reduced violence appears to hold at both the individual and neighborhood levels of analysis. This phenomenon has been referred to as the immigrant or Latino paradox. It has been suggested, although rarely examined, that cultural differences and strong social networks among immigrants account for their lower violence rates. These factors even appear strong enough to counterbalance the crime-promoting effects of economic disadvantage. This study investigates whether such patterns extend to intimate partner violence. Consistent with research on other forms of violence, we find that neighborhoods with greater concentrations of immigrants have lower levels of intimate partner violence. This relationship appears to be partially mediated by cultural norms and social ties.	2	Emily M. Wright; Michael L. Benson

Using data from a study of junior college professors in Kentucky (N = 329), the study finds that union participation is strongly linked to a distrust of campus administrators and having pro-union friends and colleagues. Likewise, perceptions of union efficacy, a liberal identity as well the professor's education level predicted the actual joining of their campus' faculty union.	4	Gregory Goldey; Eric Swank; Constance Hardesty; Randall Swain
Sadi-Nakar, Merav. 2010. 'Doing Psychology, Doing Inequality: Rethinking the Role of Psychology in Creating and Maintaining Social Inequality.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:3 354-376.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	0	The relationship between psychological disciplines and inequality has been a subject of great scholarly interest in the last several decades. Most works on the subject analyze macro features of psychological disciplines (mainly their evaluative tools, theoretical assumptions, and disciplinary power) and criticize them as biased against minorities. This paper re-examines the relationship between psychology and inequality from a micro, face-to-face standpoint. Drawing on close observations of 33 placement committees in which professionals from various psychological fields (psychology, social work, school counseling, etc.) discuss children's eligibility for special education services, it portrays the actual doing of psychology as an inconsistent and malleable endeavor. In contrast to the macro-oriented research on the relationship between psychology and inequality, it shows that in actual face-to-face interactions, professionals use different types of folk concerns that often exchange formal evaluative criteria, theoretical assumptions or professional authority in final placement decisions. By revealing the different folk considerations professionals use to sort and analyze working- versus middle-class parents, this project adds an essential layer to scholarly understanding of the relationship between psychological practice and inequality.	1	Merav Sadi-Nakar
Fominaya, Cristina. 2010. 'Creating Cohesion From Diversity: the Challenge of Collective Identity Formation in the Global Justice Movement.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:3 377-404.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	6	Collective identity formation is important because it plays a crucial role in sustaining movements over time. Studying collective identity formation in autonomous groups in the Global Justice Movement poses a challenge because they encompass a multiplicity of identities, ideologies, issues, frames, collective action repertoires, and organizational forms. This article analyzes the process of collective identity formation in three anti-capitalist globalization groups in Madrid, Spain, based on 3 years of ethnographic fieldwork. The author argues that for new groups practicing participatory democracy the regular face-to-face assemblies are the crucial arena in which collective identity can form and must be both effective and participatory in order to foster a sense of commitment and belonging. The article raises the possibility that scholars should consider what seems to be an oxymoron: the possible benefits of ``failure'' for social movements.	1	Cristina Flesher Fominaya
Scheitle, Christopher & Kevin Dougherty. 2010. 'Race, Diversity, and Membership Duration in Religious Congregations.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:3 405-423.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	6	It has long been noted that religious congregations tend to be racially homogenous. Previous case studies assert that members of a numerical minority group face individual and organizational pressures that lead them to leave congregations faster than majority members. This can create a constant pull toward homogeneity despite congregational efforts to diversify. Building on theory in organizational ecology, we test this assertion using national, multi level data from the U.S. Congregational Life Survey. The analysis shows that members of a numerical minority do have shorter durations of membership than majority members and that the gap between the two increases with the size of the majority.	2	Christopher P.

Finnegan, Amy. 2010. 'Forging Forgiveness: Collective Efforts Amidst War in Northern Uganda.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:3 424-447.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	1	This paper is a case study analysis of the sociological phenomena of forgiveness occurring in an ongoing two-decade war in northern Uganda. Building on a long-term relationship with the region and utilizing the methods of participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and a qualitative questionnaire, I identify two especially important social mechanisms that correlate with the prevalence of forgiveness discourse amongst the Acholi people of northern Uganda: (1) a communal sense of war fatigue and (2) a sense of Acholi collective identity, which the religious and cultural leaders have emphasized to promote a pervasive public dialogue of forgiveness. While recognizing that forgiveness in northern Uganda is contested, findings from my study point to how forgiveness opens a space for some Acholi to assert power and express agency in their lives after years of being portrayed largely as victims. Furthermore, forgiveness also offers the opportunity for some Acholi to experience interpersonal empowerment by maintaining a locus of control through meaning-making.	1	Amy C. Finnegan
Matthews, Todd, Lynn Hempel & Frank Howell. 2010. 'Gender and the Transmission of Civic Engagement: Assessing the Influences on Youth Civic Activity.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:3 448-474.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	1	The study of civic activity has become a central focus for many social scientists over the past decade, generating considerable research and debate. Previous studies have largely overlooked the role of youth socialization into civic life, most notably in the settings of home and school. Further, differences along gender lines in civic capacity have not been given sufficient attention in past studies. This study adds to the literature by examining the potential pathways in the development of youth civic activity and potential, utilizing both gender-neutral and gender-specific structural equation modeling of data from the 1996 National Household Education Survey. Results indicate that involvement by parents in their child's schooling plays a crucial, mediating role in the relationship between adult and youth civic activity. Gender differences are minimal; thus adult school involvement is crucial for transmitting civic culture from parents to both female and male youth.	3	Todd L. Matthews; Lynn M. Hempel; Frank M.

York, Richard & Brett Clark. 2010. 'Critical Materialism: Science, Technology, and Environmental Sustainability.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:3 475-499.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	2	There are widely divergent views on how science and technology are connected to environmental problems. A view commonly held among natural scientists and policy makers is that environmental problems are primarily technical problems that can be solved via the development and implementation of technological innovations. This technologically optimistic view tends to ignore power relationships in society and the political-economic order that drives environmental degradation. An opposed view, common among postmodernist and poststructuralist scholars, is that the emergence of the scientific worldview is one of the fundamental causes of human oppression. This postmodernist view rejects scientific epistemology and often is associated with an anti-realist stance, which ultimately serves to deny the reality of environmental problems, thus (unintentionally) abetting right-wing efforts to scuttle environmental protection. We argue that both the technologically optimistic and the postmodernist views are misguided, and both undermine our ability to address environmental crises. We advocate the adoption of a critical materialist stance, which recognizes the importance of natural science for helping us to understand the world while also recognizing the social embeddedness of the scientific establishment and the need to challenge the manipulation of science by the elite.	2	Richard York; Brett Clark
Alario, Margarita & William Freudenburg. 2010. 'Environmental Risks and Environmental Justice, or How Titanic Risks Are Not So Titanic After All.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:3 500-512.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	4	Some of the best-known social scientific theories of risks are those that have been elaborated by Anthony Giddens and Ulrich Beck. Although their arguments differ greatly, they agree in seeing the technologically induced risks of today's ``Risk Society'' as global-so pervasive that they transcend all socioeconomic as well as geopolitical and national boundaries. Most empirical work, however, provides greater support for a theoretical tradition exemplified by Short and Erikson. In this paper, we argue that many of the technological mega-risks described by Giddens and Beck as ``transcending'' social boundaries are better described as ``Titanic risks,'' referring not so much to their colossal impact as to the fact that-as was the case for the majority of the victims on the Titanic-actual risks are related to victims' socioeconomic as well as sociogeographic locations. Previous research has shown this to be the case with high-risk technologies, such as nuclear energy and weaponry, and also with localized ones, such as toxic waste disposal. This article illustrates that the same is true even for the most genuinely ``global'' risks of all, namely those associated with global climate disruption.	2	Margarita V. Alario; William R.

Picou, J. & Kenneth Hudson. 2010. 'Hurricane Katrina and Mental Health: a Research Note on Mississippi Gulf Coast Residents.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:3 513-524.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	3	Katrina was the most devastating and deadliest hurricane in recent U.S. history. The storm was particularly destructive for residents of the Mississippi Gulf Coast where sustained winds of 135 mph and a storm surge of 32 feet literally obliterated the built and modified environments. Limited research exists on the chronic (32 months) mental health impacts of survivors in this geographical area. Random-digit dialing telephone surveys were administered in Harrison and Hancock counties (Mississippi) in April and May 2008 and data were collected on a number of mental health outcomes. The results of the calculation of Oridinary Least Squares (OLS) regression models revealed that females, African Americans, and less-educated residents manifested the most severe mental health impacts. Most important, consistent findings for depression and Katrina-related psychological stress indicate that residents who were separated from family members, had maximum residential damage, and suffered severe financial problems remained significantly impacted 32 months after Katrina's landfall. A secondary stressor, in the form of having applications to the Mississippi State Grant Program denied or not processed also predicted personal depression. The implications of these findings are discussed.	2	J. Steven Picou; Kenneth Hudson
Breen, Richard & Ruud Luijkx. 2010. 'Mixture Models for Ordinal Data.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 39:1 3-24.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	2	Cumulative probability models are widely used for the analysis of ordinal data. In this article the authors propose cumulative probability mixture models that allow the assumptions of the cumulative probability model to hold within subsamples of the data. The subsamples are defined in terms of latent class membership. In the case of the ordered logit mixture model, on which the authors focus here, the assumption of a logistic distribution for an underlying latent dependent variable holds within each latent class, but because the sample then comprises a weighted sum of these distributions, the assumption of an underlying logistic distribution may not hold for the sample as a whole. The authors show that the latent classes can be allowed to vary in terms of both their location and scale and illustrate the approach using three examples.	2	Richard Breen; Ruud Luijkx
Poon, Wai-Yin & Hai-Bin Wang. 2010. 'Analysis of a Two-level Structural Equation Model With Missing Data.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 39:1 25-55.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	0	Structural equation models are widely used to model relationships among latent unobservable constructs and observable variables. In some studies, the data set used for analysis is comprised of observations that are drawn from a known hierarchical structure and involves missing entries. A two-level structural equation model can be used to analyze such data sets. Direct maximum likelihood methods for analyzing two-level structural equation models are available in software, such as LISREL and Mplus. These software programs also have options to handle missing observations. The authors develop an alternative procedure that uses an expectation maximization (EM) type algorithm. Using appropriate approximations, the procedure can be implemented using simple statistical software in combination with a basic structural equation modeling program. The authors address the implementation of the procedure in detail and provide syntax codes in R, which is available in the public domain, to implement the proposed procedure. The discussion of the procedure is made with reference to the analysis of a data set that studies job characteristic variables. The authors also use simulation studies to examine the performance of the proposed procedure. The results indicate that the proposed method, which is easily accessible to users, represents a reliable alternative for analyzing two-level structural equation models with missing data.	2	Wai-Yin Poon; Hai-Bin Wang
Tighe, Elizabeth, David Livert, Melissa Barnett & Leonard Saxe. 2010. 'Cross-survey Analysis to Estimate Low-incidence Religious Groups.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 39:1 56-82.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	1	Population-based surveys are of limited utility to estimate rare or low-incidence groups, particularly for those defined by religion or ethnicity not included in the U.S. Census. Methods of cross-survey analysis and small area estimation, however, can be used to provide reliable estimates of such low-incidence groups. To illustrate these methods, data from 50 national surveys are combined to examine the Jewish population in the United States. Hierarchical models are used to examine clustering of respondents within surveys and geographic regions. Bayesian analyses with Monte Carlo simulations are used to obtain pooled, state-level estimates poststratified by sex, race, education, and age to obtain certainty intervals about the estimates. This cross-survey approach provides a useful and practical analytic framework that can be generalized both to more extensive study of religion in the United States and to other social science problems in which single data sources are insufficient for reliable statistical inference.	4	Elizabeth Tighe; David Livert; Melissa Barnett; Leonard Saxe
Skinner, Chris & Louis-Andre Vallet. 2010. 'Fitting Log-linear Models to Contingency Tables From Surveys With Complex Sampling Designs: an Investigation of the Clogg-eliason Approach.' Sociological Methods \& Research. 39:1 83-108.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	1	Clogg and Eliason (1987) proposed a simple method for taking account of survey weights when fitting log-linear models to contingency tables. This article investigates the properties of this method. A rationale is provided for the method when the weights are constant within the cells of the table. For more general cases, however, it is shown that the standard errors produced by the method are invalid, contrary to claims in the literature. The method is compared to the pseudo maximum likelihood method both theoretically and through an empirical study of social mobility relating daughter's class to father's class using survey data from France. The method of Clogg and Eliason is found to underestimate standard errors systematically. The article concludes by recommending against the use of this method, despite its simplicity. The limitations of the method may be overcome by using the pseudo maximum likelihood method.	2	Chris Skinner; Louis-Andre Vallet
Lopez, Steven. 2010. 'Workers, Managers, and Customers: Triangles of Power in Work Communities.' Work and Occupations. 37:3 251-271.	Work and Occupations	2010	10	The sociology of service work has blossomed in the 10 years since Work and Occupations first published a special issue on this subject. This introductory essay chronicles developments and new debates around emotional labor, worker-customer relationships in the service triangle, and the nexus of gender and control in service work. Several neglected themes are highlighted, including the relationship between race and the organization of work on the shop floor, as well as a number of themes that were once prominent in industrial sociology but which have fallen into relative neglect in the sociology of service work despite their continuing relevance.	1	Steven Henry Lopez
Villarreal, Ana. 2010. 'the Bus Owner, the Bus Driver, and His Lover: Gendered Class Struggle in the Service Work Triangle.' Work and Occupations. 37:3 272-294.	Work and Occupations	2010	3	Sociologists of service work have firmly established that clients may become crucial allies for either workers or managers at conflict throughout the labor process. However, less attention has been given to how these colluding relations may extend beyond the limits of a service interaction. An ethnographic approach into the nature of the alliances between bus drivers and their passengers in Monterrey, Mexico, revealed a subterranean gender system that systematically structured workers' struggle against management in ways that have not been considered by the sociology of service work. How might personal, emotional, and sexualized connections weave into class struggle? In this article, the author traces a series of strategies and counterstrategies developed by male bus owners and bus drivers in their quest for control over profit, highlighting the gendered motivations and means that sustain this gendered class struggle. The article concludes with a hypothetical overview of the contradictory ways class and gender systems may be articulated and how further research along these lines might deepen the understanding of class struggle.	1	Ana T.

Sallaz, Jeffrey. 2010. 'Service Labor and Symbolic Power: on Putting Bourdieu to Work.' Work and Occupations. 37:3 295-319.	Work and Occupations	2010	2	The subfield that is the sociology of service labor continues to generate vibrant internal dialogue. It was the author's original intent to push forward the frontier of theory within this field, by performing an ethnography of service work in a non-American context (that of post-apartheid South Africa). Once in the field, however, he found himself moving backward as he was forced to problematize basic assumptions concerning the very category of service. In brief, the author discovered that managers in a competitive tourism industry refused to label their employees' interactive labor as ``service,'' whereas workers themselves actively advocated for such a designation. To document the interplay between material and symbolic politics of production, the author turned to the work of Pierre Bourdieu-especially his theory of political representation and the accompanying concept of nomination struggles.	1	Jeffrey J.

Riain, Sean. 2010. 'the Missing Customer and the Ever-present Market: Software Developers and the Service Economy.' Work and Occupations. 37:3 320-348.	Work and Occupations	2010	3	Although some software engineers and developers work directly with the final users of their product to generate customized software, many do not. However, drawing on an ethnographic study of software developers in a U. S. firm in Ireland, this article argues that both software developers who work closely with customers and those who do not can be thought of as ``service workers.'' The article extends the analysis of the ``service triangle'' of workers, managers, and customers to software workers who interact with customers in the software development and support process. It then uses the case of software workers who do not interact with customers to rethink our definition of what counts as service work. For these workers, the customer also looms large in the workplace-but only as an abstract entity to which they should respond and be attentive, mobilized through organizational mechanisms that transmit and simulate market pressures rather than through concrete interactions with customers themselves. The irony is that an organization of production that mobilizes the customer as the driving force of the production process ultimately, and largely unintentionally, marginalizes the customer as irrational and incompetent-an outsider in the service economy, with little input into the technologies they end up using.	1	Sean O.

Work and Occupations	2010	14	Upscale retail stores prefer to hire class-privileged workers because they embody particular styles and mannerisms that match their specialized brands. Yet retail jobs pay low wages and offer few benefits. How do these employers attract middle-class workers to these bad jobs? Drawing on interviews with retail workers and Bourdieu's theory of habitus, the authors find that employers succeed by appealing to their consumer interests. The labor practices we identify contribute to the re-entrenchment of job segregation, race and gender discrimination, and fetishism of consumption. The conclusion argues against rewarding aesthetic labor and suggests other rationales for upgrading low-wage retail employment.	2	Christine L. Williams; Catherine Connell

Work and Occupations	2010	2	This article charts changing power relations within customer services, focusing on frontline service sector managers (FLSSMs): what they do and how they do it. Although increasingly ghostlike in the sociology of customer service work, the FLSSM is a mediator of the often divergent interests of employees, senior management, and customers. Drawing on Kanter's notion of power failure in management circuits, the article depicts a series of ``triangle dramas'' drawn from a variety of frontline settings that show how managers can be denied access to ``lines of power.'' The analysis questions the expectation that FLSSMs have sufficient power to resolve customer dissatisfactions or address structural failings.	2	Sharon C. Bolton; Maeve Houlihan

Work and Occupations	2010	2	There is an important research gap regarding how the service triangle in care work is affected by the use of surveillance technology. This article addresses this gap by reporting quantitative and qualitative research undertaken in three U. K. local government home care organizations. Through regression analysis, it is found that discretionary effort is positively related, and organizational commitment negatively related, to information technology as a controlling force and management hindering the delivery of client services. The qualitative research triangulates these findings and offers complementarity by showing that workers continued to give discretionary effort in order to maintain the delivery of meaningful care to clients, even as they lowered their commitment to the organization. The conclusion draws out the implications of these findings for understanding of the social relations of the service triangle in contemporary society.	2	Kenneth Brown; Marek Korczynski

American Journal of Sociology	2010	0	Beginning in 1938, some American business groups campaigned to repeal the Sixteenth Amendment and limit the federal taxation of income and wealth. Although their proposed upward-redistributive policy would benefit few voters, it won the support of 31 state legislatures. To explain this outcome, this article offers a theory of strategic policy crafting by advocacy groups. Such groups may succeed even in otherwise unfavorable institutional environments if they craft their proposals to fit the salient policy context. Archival evidence and event history analysis support this hypothesis. Public opinion also helps explain legislative support for upward-redistributive policy.	1	Isaac William Martin

American Journal of Sociology	2010	19	The authors consider how uncertainty over protest occurrence shapes the strategic interaction between companies and activists. Analyzing Wal-Mart, the authors find support for their theory that companies respond to this uncertainty through a ``test for protest'' approach. In Wal-Mart's case, this consists of low-cost probes in the form of new store proposals. They then withdraw if they face protests, especially when those protests signal future problems. Wal-Mart is more likely to open stores that are particularly profitable, even if they are protested. This uncertainty-based account stands in sharp contrast to full-information models that characterize protests as rare miscalculations.	3	Paul Ingram; Lori Qingyuan Yue; Hayagreeva Rao

American Journal of Sociology	2010	3	Much of what we know about strikes is grounded in the context of postwar Fordism, a unique historical moment of relatively institutionalized labor-management relations. Yet the resurgence of corporate resistance over the past quarter century, coupled with an increasingly hostile political and economic climate, has fundamentally transformed the American industrial landscape. Drawing from this research and insights on social movements and formal organizations, we expect unions will vary considerably in their response to threats. Our analysis, based on a comprehensive data set of U. S. strikes from 1984 to 2002, reveals the importance of such intra-movement cleavages for strike activity and for the prospects of organized labor in the contemporary United States. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for scholarship on threat and social movement challenges more generally.	2	Andrew W. Martin; Marc Dixon

In the context of Unnithan et al.'s integrated model of suicide and homicide, high suicide rates in the northern core and a predilection for violence against others in the southern periphery may be consistently interpreted in terms of theories of the civilizing process and internal colonialism. Alternative explanations of southern violence in 19th-century France are explored and rejected, and additional theoretical applications are suggested.	1	Hugh P. Whitt

American Journal of Sociology	2010	2	This article examines variation in the social position of mixed-race populations by exploiting county-level variation in the degree of occupational differentiation between blacks and mulattoes in the 1880 U. S. census. The role of the mixed-race category as either a ``buffer class'' or a status threat depended on the class composition of whites. Black/mulatto occupational differentiation was greatest where whites had high occupational prestige and thus little to fear from a mulatto group. Furthermore, differentiation increased the risk of lynching where whites had relatively low status and decreased the risk of lynching where whites had relatively high status.	1	Aaron Gullickson

American Journal of Sociology	2010	4	The welfare state promises to moderate the duration and concentration of poverty. The authors ask how well this promise has been fulfilled in the United States and Britain from 1993 to 2003. They examine two aspects of poverty vulnerability during this period of welfare reform: (1) its persistence and associated risk factors and (2) the efficacy of social transfers. After accounting for measurement error, sociodemographic characteristics, and the impact of redistributive programs, the authors find that poverty is often persistent and risk is concentrated, especially in the United States. Moreover, the British safety net appears to better protect those at risk.	3	Diana Worts; Amanda Sacker; Peggy McDonough

Lincoln, Anne. 2010. 'the Shifting Supply of Men and Women to Occupations: Feminization in Veterinary Education.' Social Forces. 88:5 1969-1998.	Social Forces	2010	4	A confining limitation for the occupational sex segregation literature has been the inability to determine how many persons of one sex would have entered an occupation had the other sex not successfully entered instead. Using panel data from all American colleges of veterinary medicine (1976-1995), a fixed-effects model with lagged independent variables finds support for the concurrent effects of many hypothesized feminization mechanisms. Declining relative earnings and policies aimed at increasing production of graduates affect applications from men and women similarly, but feminization is driven by the decline in men's college graduation and their avoidance of fields dominated by women. The findings demonstrate the relative contributions and interdependence of supply and demand to occupational sex composition and the job search process more broadly.	1	Anne E. Lincoln

By analyzing gender-designated job requisitions for the entry-level labor market in a Japanese city, this study investigates employers' pre-hire decisions about the wage level and on-the-job training that accompany the sex typing of jobs. Results show that employers' sex typing excludes women in advance from jobs that provide higher wages and longer training.	1	Eunmi Mun

Social Forces. 88:5 2027-2052.	Social Forces	2010	8	This study revisits the Wisconsin model of status attainment from a life course developmental perspective Fixed-effects regression analyses lend strong support to the Wisconsin framework's core proposition that academic performance and significant others' influence shape educational expectations. However, investigating the process of expectation formation back to the elementary grades yields insights not evident when analyses are limited to the high school years: (1. many youth consistently expect to attend college from as early as fourth grade; (2. the expectations of middle- and low-SES youth are less stable, and across years the preponderance of their exposure to socialization influences mitigates against sustained college ambitions; (3. long-term stable expectations are more efficacious in forecasting college enrollment than are changing, volatile expectations As anticipated in the Wisconsin framework, family- and school-based socialization processes indeed contribute to social reproduction through children's educational expectations, but the process starts much earlier and includes dynamics outside the scope of the original status attainment studies.	5	Robert Bozick; Karl Alexander; Doris Entwisle; Susan Dauber; Kerri Kerr

Social Forces	2010	5	To what extent did the increase in wage inequality among men in the United States over the past three decades result from job loss and/or employment instability We propose a simple method for decomposing the change in wage inequality into components due to upward and downward between-employer mobility and within-employer wage changes using data on men's wages and job mobility from the 1977-2005 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics We find that downward employer mobility a proxy for job displacement based on movement to a lower paid job with a new employer has the largest effect on inequality over a two-year period. However, the effect of job displacement declines with time. We find that the effect of job loss accounts for 39 percent of the increase in wage inequality during the average eight-year period from 1977 through 2005, compared to 52 percent that is attributable to wage changes for workers who stay with the same employer.	2	Ted Mouw; Arne L.

Collett, Jessica & Omar Lizardo. 2010. 'Occupational Status and the Experience of Anger.' Social Forces. 88:5 2079-2104.	Social Forces	2010	7	Current theories in the sociology of emotions posit contradictory expectations regarding the relationship between status and the relative experience of anger, with some predicting a negative relationship and others proposing a positive one. We test the compatibility of these opposing hypotheses by examining the relationship between anger and a key dimension of socioeconomic status the occupational status score of an individual's occupation for a representative sample of Americans. We connect different strands of theory and research in the social psychology of emotions to posit a non-linear relationship between occupational status and the experience of anger. Analyses of data from the 1996 General Social Survey's emotions module (N = 1460) are consistent with this integrative account. Individuals located at the two opposite ends of the status and prestige hierarchy are more likely to experience anger than those of middle status. We use insight from Blau's macro-structural theory to help elucidate this complex relationship.	2	Jessica L. Collett; Omar Lizardo

Political capital is most fungible in institutional domains where government restricts economic activity. In this sense, the value of political connections in China does not differ fundamentally from patterns observable in established market economics. We interpret this as evidence suggesting China may have experienced a tipping point in its transition to a market economy around the turn of the new century.	2	Victor Nee; Sonja Opper

Social Forces	2010	11	Although income inequality in Central and Eastern Europe was considerably lower during socialism than in other countries at comparable levels of development, it increased significantly in all Central and East European states after the fall of communist regimes. However, some of these countries managed to maintain comparatively low inequality levels 10 years into the transition period while inequalities have skyrocketed in others. What explains this variation? This article presents one of the first longitudinal cross-national analyses of the factors that determine changes in income inequality in 10 Central and East European countries during the first decade after 1989 Results suggest that rising Income inequality is principally related to (1. the expansion idle private sector, (2 retrenchment of the redistributive state, (3. the social exclusion of ethno-national minorities, and (4. penetration of foreign capital. Moreover, the analyses suggest that privatization strategies promoting foreign investment created more inequality than those promoting domestic investment.

We identify two sources of ecological interdependence among technology domains First, there are symbiotic interdependencies, implying that the rate of growth of one technology domain is driven by the advances made in other technology domains. Second, some technology domains compete with each other, implying that the rate at which a given technology domain advances varies inversely with the competitive pressure it receives from other technology domains. Based on all the technological knowledge patented in the United States between 1975 and 1999, we find statistical support for our argument and hypotheses.	1	Gianluca Carnabuci

Few studies have examined media coverage of corporate deviance This study investigates news coverage of six large-scale accounting scandals that broke in 2001 and 2002. Using a variety of empirical methods to analyze the 51 largest U.S. newspapers, the study tests several explanations for tendencies to run more or less coverage of the scandals in question. The study then examines the substantive focus of coverage. First, the results suggest that scandal coverage was influenced by the political ideology of newspapers, as opposed to economic interests or social structural tics between firms. Second, the analysis shows that attention to the adjudication of individual crimes and the punishment of individual offenders received the bulk of media attention.	1	Mike Owen Benediktsson

Juarez represents an opportunity lot researchers to test for patterns of injustice in a recently urbanizing metropolis of the Global South. We use spatial-econometric modeling to predict the four unique hazard variables and a composite hazard variable using socio-demographic variables at the neighborhood level Lower class and higher percentages of children and migrants were statistically significant predictors of composite hazard density These results align with previous studies in the North. However, disaggregating these results by hazard type reveals important and counterintuitive differences in groups at risk based on the market-orientation of the hazard (i.e., domestic vs transnational) and its location within the urban structure.	4	Sara E.

Social Forces	2010	8	This article builds on an important but underdeveloped social science concept the ``scene'' as a cluster of urban amenities-to contribute to social science theory and subspecialties such as urban and rural, class, race and gender studies Scenes grow more important in less industrial, more expressively-oriented and contingent societies where traditional constraints fall and self-motivated action mound consumption, leisure and amenities is a more important feature of social cohesiveness and interaction. Scenes contextualize the individual through amenities and consumption-based expressions of shared sensibilities as to what is right, beautiful and genuine. This framework adds to concepts such as neighborhood and workplace by specifying 15 dimensions of the urban scenescape. Like neighborhood and workplace, scenes reduce anomie, but because of their focus on consumption and the use of specific amenities, they are more consistent with today's ethos of contingency, moving beyond traditional ideas of the fundamental power of social, family and occupational background. We introduce a new amenities-focused database to measure and analyze scenes and their dimensions for each of 40,000 U.S. zip codes. We illustrate the framework by applying it to one distinct type of scene, bohemia, and analyze its position in the broader social system.	3	Daniel Silver; Terry Nichols Clark; Clemente Jesus Yanez

Social Forces	2010	3	We introduce a method for measuring effective government and modeling its consequences for social well:ire at the individual level. Our focus is on the experiences of citizens living in African countries where famine remains a serious threat. ha government It is effective, it will be able to deliver goods that individuals need to improve their social welfare. At a minimum, effective governments facilitate reliable access to food for its citizens. We assess this conception of effective government via a multi-level model horn 17 sub-Saharan countries sampled in 2005 by Afrobarometer. We find that citizens who live in regions and in countries with a civil bureaucracy, reliable law enforcement and good infrastructure enjoy higher levels of food security than those who live in regions with weaker institutional penetration	2	Audrey Sacks; Margaret Levi
Klofstad, Casey. 2010. 'the Lasting Effect of Civic Talk on Civic Participation: Evidence From a Panel Study.' Social Forces. 88:5 2353-2375.	Social Forces	2010	1	Extant research shows that individuals who discuss politics and current events with their peers also participate more actively in civil society,. However, this correlation is not sufficient evidence of causation due to a number of analytical biases. To address this problem, data were collected through a panel study conducted on students who were randomly assigned to dormitories during their first year of college. In addition, the data were preprocessed before analysis with a matching procedure. These data show that discussing politics and current events caused these students to participate in civic activities during their first year of college. A follow-up study conducted on the same population during their fourth year of college shows that the positive effect of civic talk on civic participation still exists despite the passage of three years. Further analysis shows that the boost in civic participation initially after engaging in civic talk is the mechanism by which the effect of civic talk lasts into the future.	1	Casey A. Klofstad
Haye, Kayla, Garry Robins, Philip Mohr & Carlene Wilson. 2010. 'Obesity-related Behaviors in Adolescent Friendship Networks.' Social Networks. 32:3 161-167.	Social Networks	2010	25	This study examines obesity-related behaviors within adolescent friendship networks, because adolescent peers have been identified as being important determinants of many health behaviors. We applied ERGM selection models for single network observations to determine if close adolescent friends engage in similar behaviors and to explore associations between behavior and popularity. Same-sex friends were found to be similar on measures of organized physical activity in two out of three school-based friendship networks. Female friends were found to engage in similar screen-based behaviors, and male friends tended to be similar in their consumption of high-calorie foods. Popularity (receiving ties) was also associated with some behaviors, although these effects were gender specific and differed across networks.

Social Networks	2010	3	Structural holes theory suggests a variety of possible explanations for the empirically observed relationship between structural holes and individual managerial performance. However, little has been done to disentangle one mechanism from another. This paper empirically tests a mediated moderation model that distinguishes between the five different theoretical mechanisms: autonomy, competition, information brokering, opportunity recognition and innovativeness. The findings suggest that of these five theoretical causal motors, innovativeness plays a key role in linking network structure and network content to performance.	1	Simon Rodan

The focus of this paper is on the ethics for online research. Our aim is to reignite the discussion about the way the availability and consequent (mis)use of `social' data, e.g. social network site profiles or newsgroup postings by researchers is about to necessitate a new definition of and fight for the right for a private sphere that each individual may claim in the public of the virtual worlds. We conclude with an approach on how to accomplish that.	2	Bettina Hoser; Tanja Nitschke
Brashears, Matthew. 2010. 'Anomia and the Sacred Canopy: Testing a Network Theory.' Social Networks. 32:3 187-196.	Social Networks	2010	6	This article evaluates the Durkheim/Berger argument that integration in a network of co-religionists protects against anomia. The 1985 General Social Survey network instrument is used to evaluate the effect of integration on anomia and the probability of unhappiness. Results indicate that contact with religiously homogeneous others paired with personal religious belief reduces anomia and the likelihood of unhappiness. Additionally, while ego/alter closeness is important, alter/alter closeness is not. These results suggest that individuals benefit from religious association more so than religious community. Additional analyses indicate that these results are unlikely to be due to homophily.	1	Matthew E. Brashears
Kovacs, Balazs. 2010. 'a Generalized Model of Relational Similarity.' Social Networks. 32:3 197-211.	Social Networks	2010	0	This paper introduces two principles for relational similarity, and based on these principles it proposes a novel geometric representation for similarity. The first principle generalizes earlier measures of similarity such as Pearson-correlation and structural equivalence: while correlation and structural equivalence measure similarity by the extent to which the actors have similar relationships to other actors or objects, the proposed model views two actors similar if they have similar relationships to similar actors or objects. The second principle emphasizes consistency among similarities: not only are actors similar if they have similar relationships to similar objects, but at the same time objects are similar if similar actors relate to them similarly. We examine the behavior of the proposed similarity model through simulations, and re-analyze two classic datasets: the Davis et al. (1941) data on club membership and the roll-call data of the U.S. Senate. We find that the generalized model of similarity is especially useful if (1) the dimensions of comparison are not independent, or (2) the data are sparse, or (3) the boundaries between clusters are not clear.	1	Balazs Kovacs
Valente, Thomas & Kayo Fujimoto. 2010. 'Bridging: Locating Critical Connectors in a Network.' Social Networks. 32:3 212-220.	Social Networks	2010	10	This paper proposes several measures for bridging in networks derived from Granovetter's (1973) insight that links which reduce distances in a network are important structural bridges. Bridging is calculated by systematically deleting links and calculating the resultant changes in network cohesion (measured as the inverse average path length). The average change for each node's links provides an individual level measure of bridging. We also present a normalized version which controls for network size and a network-level bridging index. Bridging properties are demonstrated on hypothetical networks, empirical networks, and a set of 100 randomly generated networks to show how the bridging measure correlates with existing network measures such as degree, personal network density, constraint, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and vitality. Bridging and the accompanying methodology provide a family of new network measures useful for studying network structure, network dynamics, and network effects on substantive behavioral phenomenon.	2	Thomas W.

Faust, Katherine. 2010. 'a Puzzle Concerning Triads in Social Networks: Graph Constraints and the Triad Census.' Social Networks. 32:3 221-233.	Social Networks	2010	2	Evidence from many sources shows that triadic tendencies are important structural features of social networks (e.g. transitivity or triadic closure) and triadic configurations are the basis for both theoretical claims and substantive outcomes (e.g. strength of weak ties, tie stability, or trust). A contrasting line of research demonstrates that triads in empirical social networks are well predicted by lower order graph features (density and dyads), accounting for around 90\% of the variability in triad distributions when comparing different social networks (Faust, 2006, 2007, 2008). These two sets of results present a puzzle: how can substantial triadic tendencies occur when triads in empirical social networks are largely explained by lower order graph features? This paper provides insight into the puzzle by considering constraints that lower order graph features place on the triad census. Taking a comparative perspective, it shows that triad censuses from 159 social networks of diverse species and social relations are largely explained by their lower order graph features (the dyad census) through formal constraints that force triads to occur in narrow range of configurations. Nevertheless, within these constraints, a majority of networks exhibit significant triadic patterning by departing from expectation.	1	Katherine Faust
Hsieh, Mo-Han & Christopher Magee. 2010. 'a New Method for Finding Hierarchical Subgroups From Networks.' Social Networks. 32:3 234-244.	Social Networks	2010	1	We present a new method for decomposing a social network into an optimal number of hierarchical subgroups. With a perfect hierarchical subgroup defined as one in which every member is automorphically equivalent to each other, the method uses the REGGE algorithm to measure the similarities among nodes and applies the k-means method to group the nodes that have congruent profiles of dissimilarities with other nodes into various numbers of hierarchical subgroups. The best number of subgroups is determined by minimizing the intra-cluster variance of dissimilarity subject to the constraint that the improvement in going to more subgroups is better than a network whose n nodes are maximally dispersed in the n-dimensional space would achieve. We also describe a decomposability metric that assesses the deviation of a real network from the ideal one that contains only perfect hierarchical subgroups. Four well known network data sets are used to demonstrate the method and metric. These demonstrations indicate the utility of our approach and suggest how it can be used in a complementary way to Generalized Blockmodeling for hierarchical decomposition.	2	Mo-Han Hsieh; Christopher L.

Social Networks	2010	70	Ties often have a strength naturally associated with them that differentiate them from each other. Tie strength has been operationalized as weights. A few network measures have been proposed for weighted networks, including three common measures of node centrality: degree, closeness, and betweenness. However, these generalizations have solely focused on tie weights, and not on the number of ties, which was the central component of the original measures. This paper proposes generalizations that combine both these aspects. We illustrate the benefits of this approach by applying one of them to Freeman's EIES dataset.	3	Tore Opsahl; Filip Agneessens; John Skvoretz

Social Science Research	2010	1	Have the 2001 terrorist attacks and two wars continued to affect the partisan salience of national security issues in US elections? Was the impact of these issues in 2008 overshadowed by renewed focus on the part of voters to domestic conditions and policy issues? This study addresses these questions using recently-released data from the National Election Studies. Building from scholarship on the partisan politics of national security, we seek to incorporate two competing theoretical perspectives on these issues. We consider the 2008 contest in conjunction with the four elections that preceded it to take into account the impact of recent historical events and evaluate key hypotheses. The analysis offers new findings regarding the over-time pattern of influence of national security conflicts on voter choice. We find evidence for the importance of national security issues in the 2008 election, alongside established sources of voter preferences. Implications for theory and research are discussed in conclusion.	3	Clem Brooks; Kyle Dodson; Nikole Hotchkiss

Social Science Research	2010	3	This article tests three classical theoretical assumptions about the cause of nationalism. It does so by testing if elite discourse, or internal- and external threats have any impact on nationalist sentiments in Europe. Macro data from various sources is combined with attitudinal data from the International Social Survey Programme 2003 for 21 European countries. Ills concluded that the articulation of nationalism by political elites does not matter. Internal threats in the form of foreign-born population and language fractionalization affect nationalist sentiment negatively, i.e. nationalist sentiments are weaker in more heterogeneous countries. Finally, it is shown that external threats, in the form of loss of territory, have a positive impact on nationalist sentiments: people are more nationalist in countries that have a more recent loss of territory.	2	Mikael Hjerm; Annette Schnabel
Gibbs, Benjamin. 2010. 'Reversing Fortunes or Content Change? Gender Gaps in Math-related Skill Throughout Childhood.' Social Science Research. 39:4 540-569.	Social Science Research	2010	3	Many scholars and policy makers of education have focused significant attention on male advantages in math skills during adolescence, but have often overlooked female advantages in math skills that emerge before school begins. As a way to explain this conflicting pattern, some scholars cite exposure to schooling as a reason why girls experience what some have termed girls' ``reversal of fortunes.'' By using first-of-its-kind data I examine math-related skills with proscriptive data from early to late childhood using two nationally-representative data sets. Moving beyond standardized assessments of math skills, this study reconciles these two competing trends using subset measures. Far from a reversal of fortunes, girls excel in math skills that are less complex (i.e. counting, shape recognition) across childhood. Girls' disadvantages in math emerge with content change-as item complexity increases over time (i.e. multiplication, division, and fractions). In contrast to standardized assessments of cognitive skills, gender gaps in item complexity may be more revealing for understanding the origins and development of gender stratification.	1	Benjamin G.

Social Science Research	2010	1	Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth Child Sample (CNLSY79), we sought to elaborate the complex interplay between childhood health and educational development over the early life course. Our approach made use of sibling comparisons to estimate the relationship between birth weight, cognitive development, and timely high school completion in models that spanned childhood, adolescence, and into early adulthood. Our findings indicated that lower birth weight, even after adjusting for fixed-family characteristics and aspects of the home environment that varied between siblings, was associated with decreased cognitive skills at age 5 and marginally significantly slower growth rates into adolescence. In addition, low birth weight increased the risk of not graduating by age 19, although this relationship reflected differences in cognitive development. Additional moderation analyses provided no evidence that birth weight effects are exacerbated by social conditions. Overall, the pattern of findings painted a complex picture of disadvantage, beginning in the womb and presumably via educational attainment, extending over the life course.	2	Jacob E.

Social Science Research	2010	5	Using structural equation modeling we examined the determinants of family emotional climate and its long-term impact on children's academic achievement and classroom behavior at the end of 5th grade. We employed the ECLS-K data a large, nationally representative sample of U.S. elementary school students. Family emotional climate was measured in the spring of kindergarten and included three dimensions: parental depression, parental warmth, and use of physical discipline. Main findings: low SES, Black and single parents were more likely to report depressive symptoms. Black parents were more likely to use physical discipline, but they also reported greater parental warmth. Asian parents were less likely to use physical discipline, but also were less likely to express parental warmth. Parental depression was associated with increased use of physical discipline and reduced parental warmth. Parental depression, measured in kindergarten, was associated with lower reading and math achievement and lower approaches to learning at the end of 5th grade. Use of physical discipline in kindergarten was associated with lower 5th-grade math achievement.	2	Katerina Bodovski; Min-Jong Youn
Liebler, Carolyn. 2010. 'Homelands and Indigenous Identities in a Multiracial Era.' Social Science Research. 39:4 596-609.	Social Science Research	2010	2	Although multiple race responses are now allowed on federal censuses and surveys, most interracially married single-race parents report a single race for their children. It is well-established that the social context of these racial identification decisions affects their outcome. This research focuses instead on the physical context. It is argued that homelands - physical places with cultural meaning - are an important component of the intergenerational transfer of a single-race identity in indigenous mixed-race families. To test potential explanations for the relationship between homelands and indigenous identities, this research focuses on families in which an interracially-married American Indian lives with a spouse and child and was included in the Census 2000 5\% Public Use Microdata Sample. Logistic regression reveals a strong effect of living in an American Indian homeland on the child's chances of being reported as single-race American Indian. This effect remains even after accounting for strong ties to American Indians and other groups, family and area poverty levels, geographic isolation, and the racial composition of the area. The intergenerational transmission of strong identities continues in this multiracial era (as it has for centuries) in the context of culturally meaningful physical places.	1	Carolyn A. Liebler
Tong, Yuying. 2010. 'Place of Education, Gender Disparity, and Assimilation of Immigrant Scientists and Engineers Earnings.' Social Science Research. 39:4 610-626.	Social Science Research	2010	2	Many existing studies have demonstrated the earnings disadvantage of immigrants in U.S. labor market. When examining the mechanism of such disadvantage, previous research has pointed to the factor of lower human capital as a portion of immigrants completed their education before immigration. This study builds on the previous research and further investigates both place of college and where they completed education on the earnings among immigrant scientists and engineers. In addition to the human capital, this study captures factors pertaining to acculturation. Using data from Scientists and Engineers Statistical Data System (SESTAT), I divide the immigrant scientists and engineers into fully foreign-educated, fully U.S.-educated and mixed foreign- and U.S.-educated groups. These categories are regressed against the native-born in a full sample and subsamples of men and women, respectively. The full-sample analysis shows that immigrant scientists and engineers who have received their college education abroad are at an earnings disadvantage, regardless of whether they completed their higher degrees in or outside the United States. However, their earnings can rise faster than their native-born peers if they completed their education in the United States. The results suggest that attending college and/or pre-college in U.S. plays a more substantial role in closing the earnings gap between immigrants and non-immigrants among scientists and engineers. Gender-specific analyses reveal that the earnings gap between immigrants and native-born women is narrower than that between their male counterparts, showing gender may play a more salient role in earnings disadvantage than immigrant status.	1	Yuying Tong
Fischer, Mary. 2010. 'Immigrant Educational Outcomes in New Destinations: an Exploration of High School Attrition.' Social Science Research. 39:4 627-641.	Social Science Research	2010	7	This study examines how young immigrants are faring in new destinations using individual level data front the 2000 IPUMS to assess the relative roles of race/ethnicity, nativity, country of origin, and place on the likelihood of not being enrolled in high school for youth aged 15-17. I found that place plays a nuanced role in the risk of non-enrollment that varies by nativity as well as other household characteristics. While children in general have higher risks of dropping out in new destination communities relative to those in established immigrant communities, the risks to immigrant children are even greater. I found that Mexican and Guatemalan origin immigrants are particularly vulnerable, especially in places with the largest increases in the percent foreign born. The implications of these findings for both immigrants and their communities are discussed in the conclusion.	1	Mary J. Fischer

Maternal nativity serves as a proxy for maternal immigration status in an effort to determine if child and family characteristics differentially predict enrollment. We consider relative, non-relative, and center-based care arrangements in two age groups: 0-2 and 3-5 years old. Multivariate analyses reveal that once demographic differences are controlled, patterns of use are mostly similar irrespective of maternal nativity.	2	Jessica M. Kahn; Joy Pastan Greenberg
Xi, Juan, Sean-Shong Hwang & Yue Cao. 2010. 'Ecological Context and Immigrants' Earnings: English Ability as a Mediator.' Social Science Research. 39:4 652-661.	Social Science Research	2010	0	Labor economic literature has demonstrated a consistent positive association between immigrants' earnings and their level of proficiency in the host society's language. Sociological literature, on the other hand, has explicated that immigrants' abilities to speak the host society's language are affected by structural/ecological factors which shape the linguistic environment of immigrants. This study proposes a logical extension of the two literatures by suggesting that structural /ecological factors affect immigrants' earnings indirectly by affecting their ability to speak the host society's language. Using individual and aggregate data from the U.S. Census 2000, we found that structural/ecological factors such as group size, segregation, and linguistic heterogeneity affected immigrants' earnings not only directly but also indirectly via their impacts on immigrants' English ability. English ability is a key mediator through which structural forces shape individual immigrant's economic assimilation outcome. Published by Elsevier Inc.	3	Juan Xi; Sean-Shong Hwang; Yue Cao

Social Science Research. 39:4 662-673.	Social Science Research	2010	9	A debate within the mortality literature centers around the impact of health behaviors on the prospects of disadvantaged groups. Meanwhile, a growing body of work illustrates the social processes that shape changes in smoking levels by socioeconomic status (SES), especially educational attainment. These literatures are merged by examining the mediating effects of cigarette smoking on education gaps in U.S. adult mortality by age and gender. Findings reveal that cigarette smoking is an important mediator of the education-mortality gap for all males and for younger females. In particular, education-mortality gaps for young men narrow considerably when cigarette smoking is accounted for, while older women experienced no reduction in the education-mortality gap with controls for smoking. These results are consistent with diffusion arguments that describe SES differences in smoking adoption by age and gender and provide strong evidence that smoking is an important differentiator of mortality risks by education.	4	Justin T.

We find that almost the entire share of the utilization differences in drug therapy between blacks and whites can be explained by the differences in the coefficients of observable characteristics, while the sources of the utilization difference between the whites and Hispanics are split between the differences in the observable characteristics and the coefficient estimates. This result implies that strategies to improve racial and ethnic disparities need to be tailored to each group by focusing on the specific factors that are attributed to causing the disparity.	2	John R.

Staff, Jeremy, John Schulenberg & Jerald Bachman. 2010. 'Adolescent Work Intensity, School Performance, and Academic Engagement.' Sociology of Education. 83:3 183-200.	Sociology of Education	2010	5	Teenagers working more than 20 hours per week perform worse in school than youth who work less. There are two competing explanations for this association: (1) that paid work takes time and effort away from activities that promote achievement, such as completing homework, preparing for examinations, getting help from parents and teachers, and participating in extracurricular activities, and (2) that the relationship between paid work and school performance is spurious, reflecting preexisting differences between students in academic ability, motivation, and school commitment. Using longitudinal data from the ongoing national Monitoring the Future project, this research examines the impact of teenage employment on school performance and academic engagement during the 8th, 10th, and 12th grades. The authors address issues of spuriousness by using a two-level hierarchical model to estimate the relationships of within-individual changes in paid work to changes in school performance and other school-related measures. Unlike in prior research, the authors compare youth school performance and academic orientation when they are actually working in high-intensity jobs to when they are jobless and wish to work intensively. Results indicate that the mere wish for intensive work corresponds with academic difficulties in a manner similar to actual intensive work.	3	Jeremy Staff; John E. Schulenberg; Jerald G. Bachman

Sociology of Education	2010	4	Promoting marriage, especially among low-income single mothers with children, is increasingly viewed as a promising public policy strategy for improving developmental outcomes for disadvantaged children. Previous research suggests, however, that children's academic achievement either does not improve or declines when single mothers marry. In this article, the authors argue that previous research may understate the benefits of mothers' marriages to children from single-parent families because (1) the short-term and long-term developmental consequences of marriage are not adequately distinguished and (2) child and family contexts in which marriage is likely to confer developmental advantages are not differentiated from those that do not. Using multiple waves of data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study- Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), the authors find that single mothers' marriages are associated with modest but statistically significant improvements in their children's academic achievement trajectories. However, only children from more advantaged single-parent families benefit from their mothers' marriage.	4	Robert L. Wagmiller; Elizabeth Gershoff; Philip Veliz; Margaret Clements
Jennings, Jennifer. 2010. 'School Choice or Schools' Choice? Managing in an Era of Accountability.' Sociology of Education. 83:3 227-247.	Sociology of Education	2010	3	Drawing on a year and a half of ethnographic research in three New York City small high schools, this study examines the role of the school in managing school choice and asks what social processes are associated with principals' disparate approaches. Although district policy did not allow principals to select students based on their performance, two of the three schools in this study circumvented these rules to recruit and retain a population that would meet local accountability targets. This article brings together sensemaking and social network theories to offer a theoretical account of schools' management of choice in an era of accountability. In doing so, the author demonstrates that principals' sensemaking about the accountability and choice systems occurred within the interorganizational networks in which they were embedded and was strongly conditioned by their own professional biographies and worldviews. Principals' networks offered access to resources that could be activated to make sense of the accountability and choice systems. How principals perceived accountability and choice policies influenced whether they activated their social networks for assistance in strategically managing the choice process, as well as how they made sense of advice available to them through these networks. Once activated, principals' networks provided uneven access to instrumental and expressive resources. Taken together, these results suggest that schools respond to accountability and choice plans in varied ways that are not simply a function of their short-term incentives.	1	Jennifer L. Jennings
Riegle-Crumb, Catherine & Eric Grodsky. 2010. 'Racial-ethnic Differences at the Intersection of Math Course-taking and Achievement.' Sociology of Education. 83:3 248-270.	Sociology of Education	2010	7	Despite increases in the representation of African American and Hispanic youth in advanced math courses in high school over the past two decades, recent national reports indicate that substantial inequality in achievement remains. These inequalities can temper one's optimism about the degree to which the United States has made real progress toward educational equity. Using data from the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS), the authors find that the math achievement gap is most pronounced among those students who take the most demanding high school math classes, such as precalculus and calculus. The authors explore the roles of family socioeconomic status and school composition in explaining this pattern. Findings suggest that among those students reaching the advanced math high school stratum, Hispanic youth from low-income families and African American youth from segregated schools fare the worst in terms of closing the achievement gap with their white peers. The authors discuss potential explanations for the achievement differences observed and stress the need for more research that focuses explicitly on the factors that inhibit minority/majority parity at the top of the secondary curricular structure.	2	Catherine Riegle-Crumb; Eric Grodsky
Fallon, Debbie. 2010. 'Accessing Emergency Contraception: the Role of Friends in the Adolescent Experience.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:5 677-694.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	1	This paper focuses on the findings of a qualitative study that explored adolescent experiences of accessing emergency hormonal contraception (EHC). It describes how anticipated judgements and associated feelings of embarrassment and shame were dealt with through friendship. The paper outlines how, contrary to the notion of the `mean girl', friends assumed crucial supporting roles which included confidante, advisor, and motivator. In some cases this included physically accompanying hesitant friends to sexual health services. The narrative brought to light how friends often kept each other on the straight and narrow, providing a sharp contrast to the image of irresponsible or shameless adolescents. Being this friend was transformative, offering a kind of reform that allowed a shift from the perceived label of promiscuous risk taker to that of informal advisor and supporter. The study concluded that friends were instrumental in the successful negotiation of the powerful discourses of risk and responsibility in the health arena and that this example of female solidarity at a time of crisis potentially plays a key role in adolescent sexual health.	1	Debbie Fallon
Robertson, Steve, Kay Sheikh & Andrew Moore. 2010. 'Embodied Masculinities in the Context of Cardiac Rehabilitation.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:5 695-710.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	7	Interest continues to gather in relation to the sociology of the body, gendered embodiment and the theoretical links between these in both health and ill-health contexts. However, the available empirical work that links embodiment, masculinities and health remains sparse. This paper presents secondary data analysis from an original study that aimed to consider the similarities and differences in the experience of a continuing (phase four) cardiac rehabilitation programme for individuals choosing to participate in either an exercise or yoga component. The data presented are derived from two in-depth interviews, carried out a year apart, with each of the 34 men who completed the original study. Watson's (2000)'male body schema' was used to guide initial data coding and the subsequent analysis generated four overarching themes: `embodied emotionality'; `renegotiated embodiment'; `embodiment and fitness' and `knowing the hidden body'. An approach that theorises from, rather than about, men's bodies is fostered, and questions are raised about previous work that suggests men are emotionally `disconnected' from their bodies and/or that they have a wholly mechanistic view of bodily function.	3	Steve Robertson; Kay Sheikh; Andrew Moore
Chan, Christine, Toity Deave & Trisha Greenhalgh. 2010. 'Childhood Obesity in Transition Zones: an Analysis Using Structuration Theory.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:5 711-729.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	2	Childhood obesity is particularly prevalent in areas that have seen rapid economic growth, urbanisation, cultural transition, and commodification of food systems. Structuration theory may illuminate the interaction between population and individual-level causes of obesity. We conducted in-depth ethnographies of six overweight/obese and four non-overweight preschool children in Hong Kong, each followed for 12-18 months. Analysis was informed by Stones' strong structuration theory. Risk factors played out differently for different children as social structures were enacted at the level of family and preschool. The network of caregiving roles and relationships around the overweight/obese child was typically weak and disjointed, and the primary caregiver appeared confused by mixed messages about what is normal, expected and legitimate behaviour. In particular, external social structures created pressure to shift childcare routines from the logic of nurturing to the logic of consumption. Our findings suggest that threats to what Giddens called ontological security in the primary caregiver may underpin the poor parenting, family stress and weak mealtime routines that mediate the relationship between an obesogenic environment and the development of obesity in a particular child. This preliminary study offers a potentially transferable approach for studying emerging epidemics of diseases of modernity in transition societies.	3	Christine Chan; Toity Deave; Trisha Greenhalgh
Daneski, Katharine, Paul Higgs & Myfanwy Morgan. 2010. 'From Gluttony to Obesity: Moral Discourses on Apoplexy and Stroke.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:5 730-744.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	1	Current UK medical guidance on the management of stroke includes advice on reducing behavioural factors that place people at risk of the disease. This paper explores the historical background to the construction of this risk; it starts by investigating the connections made between individual behaviours and the causation of apoplexy in the medical discourse during the 18th and 19th centuries described in English medical textbooks from the 1700s. In outlining the emergence of a biomedical discourse around apoplexy and stroke, we note how a number of judgemental and moral concerns are articulated particularly around diet and exercise. While different in emphasis and starting point these discourses have their echo in contemporary approaches to the prevention of stroke. We seek to show that many of the themes common in current health promotion and public health strategies can be seen as continuities of earlier concerns regarding people's health; albeit now operating against the backdrop of a somatic society rather than a broader sense of moral regulation. We also hope to show how the understanding and prevention of stroke feeds into the moral discourse of the `obesity crisis' confronting the affluent nations of North America and Europe.	3	Katharine Daneski; Paul Higgs; Myfanwy Morgan
Crawford, Paul, Brian Brown, Brigitte Nerlich & Nelya Koteyko. 2010. 'Nutritional Altruism and Functional Food: Lay Discourses on Probiotics.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:5 745-760.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	4	This exploratory study set out to analyse discourse about `friendly bacteria' by scrutinising data from focus groups convened to discuss participants' reasons for choosing probiotic food products and to set their use of probiotics in context in relation to other food choices. In discussing food choice and dietary patterns, participants in the five focus groups reported here drew on a major interpretive repertoire - that of `nutritional altruism' in which participants described making choices and preparing food which they believed would benefit others. Those caring for children or shopping for a family member with an illness or disability expressed this imperative to make decisions which would benefit the other most acutely. So far, much research has focused upon the sensory qualities and perceived health benefits for individual consumers, but this study begins to explore the discourses drawn upon when people describe why they might buy food for others. The findings have implications for health education, but also reflect a broader socio-political trend in that risks and benefits are devolved and managed at the level of individual citizens and through processes of individual choice and consumption.	4	Paul Crawford; Brian Brown; Brigitte Nerlich; Nelya Koteyko

Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:5 761-776.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	5	The high rates of diabetes and cardiovascular disease among Punjabi Sikh (PS) men are often linked to diet. Although some high fat and sugar foods in both traditional and Western foods negatively influence these illnesses, little is known about what underpins PS immigrant men's dietary practices. This article details the connections between masculinities and diet to reveal how varying gendered ideals can inform and influence the practices of senior PS Canadian immigrant men who attended community-based men's groups. Participants' masculine ideals and their alignment to those ideals were deeply rooted in spirituality and traditional cultures, which shaped the use of specific foods and beverages, yet there was also evidence that the availability and affordability of dairy products and alcohol in Canada strongly influenced men's diets. While the men's group leaders educated attendees about diet, ideologies reinforcing ties between femininities and the cooking of meals often prevailed. Linkages between participants' masculine ideals and dietary practices were both similar and discordant with the findings reported in studies of Western men. The findings drawn from this study may direct what, how and where dietary messages are targeted to senior PS Canadian immigrant men.	7	John L. Oliffe; Suki Grewal; Joan L.

Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:5 777-797.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	2	This investigation was motivated by physician reports that patient compliments often raise `red flags' for them, raising questions about whether compliments are being used in the service of achieving some kind of advantage. Our goal was to understand physician discomfort with patient compliments through analyses of audiotaped surgeon-patient encounters. Using conversation analysis, we demonstrate that both the placement and design of compliments are consequential for how surgeons hear and respond to them. The compliments offered after treatment recommendations are neither designed nor positioned to pursue institutional agendas and are responded to in ways that are largely consistent with compliment responses in everyday interaction, but include modifications that preserve surgeons' expertise. In contrast, some compliments offered before treatment recommendations pursue specific treatments and engender surgeons' resistance. Other compliments offered before treatment recommendations do not overtly pursue institutionally-relevant agendas-for example, compliments offered in the opening phase of the visit. We show how these compliments may but need not foreshadow a patient's upcoming agenda. This work extends our understanding of the interactional functions of compliments, and of the resources patients use to pursue desired outcomes in encounters with healthcare professionals.	5	Pamela L.

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	1	Using audio-recorded data from cognitive-constructivist psychotherapy, the article shows a particular institutional context in which successful professional action does not adhere to the pattern of affective neutrality which Parsons saw as an inherent component of medicine and psychotherapy. In our data, the professional's non-neutrality functions as a tool for achieving institutional goals. The analysis focuses on the psychotherapist's actions that convey a critical stance towards a third party with whom the patient has experienced problems. The data analysis revealed two practices of this kind of critique: (1) the therapist can confirm the critique that the patient has expressed or (2) return to the critique from which the patient has focused away. These actions are shown to build grounds for the therapist's further actions that challenge the patient's dysfunctional beliefs. The article suggests that in the case of psychotherapy, actions that as such might be seen as apparent lapses from the neutral professional role can in their specific context perform the task of the institution at hand.	3	Liisa Voutilainen; Anssi Perakyla; Johanna Ruusuvuori
Pittman, Chavella. 2010. 'Race and Gender Oppression in the Classroom: the Experiences of Women Faculty of Color With White Male Students.' Teaching Sociology. 38:3 183-196.	Teaching Sociology	2010	7	Research shows that an oppressive classroom environment impairs learning and academic performance for students with oppressed identities. Less research examines faculty perceptions of their classroom, but such research could reveal whether an oppressive environment impairs teaching effectiveness. Although the literature shows that women faculty of color spend a disproportionate amount of time teaching, researchers have not systematically examined their classroom experiences. My study relies on transcripts of 17 in-depth interviews with women faculty of color at a large, predominantly white research institution. Despite their legitimate authority as professors, these women describe gendered racism in their classroom interactions with students. Specifically, they depict white male students as challenging their authority, teaching competency, and scholarly expertise, as well as offering subtle and not so subtle threats to their persons and their careers.	1	Chavella T.

Wilder, Esther. 2010. 'a Qualitative Assessment of Efforts to Integrate Data Analysis Throughout the Sociology Curriculum: Feedback From Students, Faculty, and Alumni.' Teaching Sociology. 38:3 226-246.	Teaching Sociology	2010	0	Quantitative and computer literacy are increasingly recognized as core components of a liberal education in sociology. This study draws on student, faculty, and alumni questionnaires to identify the kinds of quantitative literacy skills that are perceived to be most critical for students enrolled in sociology courses. Respondents at Lehman College highlighted the need for proficiencies in a number of key areas, including (a) basic mathematical and statistical skills, such as measures of central tendency, ratios, and percentages; (b) the presentation and interpretation of quantitative data, including tables and charts; (c) the research process, such as developing hypotheses, sampling, and interpreting data; and (d) computer-based presentation and data analysis, including the use of software programs such as SPSS and Excel. Moreover, hands-on work in data analysis was highly valued by all respondents, particularly as a strategy for mastering these skills. This study suggests that effective education in quantitative literacy requires both (a) the removal of barriers to the incorporation of data analysis in sociology courses and (b) a well-sequenced sociology curriculum that pinpoints specific quantitative and computer literacy learning objectives at multiple course levels.	1	Esther Isabelle Wilder

Teaching Sociology	2010	2	One useful, but underutilized, strategy to increase quantitative literacy and promote critical sociological thinking is to have students investigate demographic trends in their local community. In this article, the authors describe a project in which students compare and contrast the demographic characteristics of two counties in their state using the 2000 Census Bureau data, formulate specific research questions using the data they have collected, and draw conclusions about the social influences on local demographic patterns using local media sources and sociological thinking. The authors present results from a quasi-experiment assessing the assignment's effectiveness in improving quantitative literacy. They also present findings from a general evaluation survey administered to students. Despite the limitations of this study, results suggest that the described assignment increased quantitative literacy as well as encouraged critical sociological thinking.	2	Amy M.

In this note the authors outline research in education that demonstrates the role of imagery and experiential learning in fostering a deeper understanding of material for students. They then focus on the ability of one film (Remember the Titans) to transport students to a place they will never experience-racially charged 1971 Virginia-and to illustrate social psychological processes of conflict reduction (contact, superordinate goals, and shared identities) as well as the link between micro-interaction, social institutions, and larger patterns of social stratification. After elaborating how the authors have used the film in class, they present findings from their students that demonstrate the effectiveness of the film for enhancing student understanding.	3	Jessica L.

American Sociological Review. 75:3 331-354.	American Sociological Review	2010	9	This article examines the causes of financial malfeasance in the largest U.S. corporations between 1995 and 2004. The findings support organizational-political embeddedness theory, which suggests that differential social structures create dependencies, incentives, and opportunities to engage in financial malfeasance. The historical analysis shows that neoliberal policies enacted between 1986 and 2000 resulted in organizational and political structures that permitted managers to engage in financial malfeasance. Our quantitative analysis provides three main findings. First, capital dependence on investors creates incentives to engage in financial malfeasance. Second, managerial strategies to increase shareholder value create incentives to engage in financial malfeasance. Third, the multilayer-subsidiary form and the political structure permitting corporate PAC contributions create opportunities to engage in financial malfeasance. These findings have important implications for public policy; the corporate and state structures enacted in the late-twentieth century were the outcome of a long-term, well-financed, and systematic political strategy that provided managers with unprecedented power, autonomy, and opportunity to engage in financial malfeasance.	2	Harland Prechel; Theresa Morris
Torfason, Magnus & Paul Ingram. 2010. 'the Global Rise of Democracy: a Network Account.' American Sociological Review. 75:3 355-377.	American Sociological Review	2010	13	We examine the influence of an interstate network created by intergovernmental organizations (IGOs) on the global diffusion of democracy. We propose that IGOs facilitate democracy's diffusion by transmitting information between member states and by interpreting that information according to prevailing norms in the world society, where democracy is viewed as the legitimate form of government. We employ a network autocorrelation model to track changes in democracy among all of the world's countries from 1815 to 2000. We find that democracy does diffuse through the IGO network and that the influence of democratic countries is stronger than that of undemocratic countries. Evidence indicates that the IGO network serves as a basis for normative diffusion. This is an important contribution to sociological accounts of globalization, which tend to emphasize diffusion divorced from network structure or diffusion dependent on the coercive influence of a small set of international organizations.	2	Magnus Thor Torfason; Paul Ingram

American Sociological Review	2010	25	How do Latino immigrants in the United States understand existing racial categories? And how does the existing U.S. racial order influence this understanding? Using data from the New Immigrant Survey (NIS), our analysis points to changes in how the U.S. racial order might operate in the future. We find that most Latino immigrants recognize the advantages of a White racial designation when asked to self-identify, but wider society is not often accepting of this White expansion. Our findings suggest that relatively darker-skinned Latino immigrants experience skin-color-based discrimination in the realm of annual income. Furthermore, Latinos who are most integrated into the United States are the most likely to opt out of the existing U.S. racial categorization scheme. We predict that a racial boundary is forming around some Latino immigrants: those with darker skin and those who have more experience in the U.S. racial stratification system.	3	Reanne Frank; Ilana Redstone Akresh; Bo Lu
Mouw, Ted & Arne Kalleberg. 2010. 'Occupations and the Structure of Wage Inequality in the United States, 1980s to 2000s.' American Sociological Review. 75:3 402-431.	American Sociological Review	2010	20	Occupations are central to the stratification systems of industrial countries, but they have played little role in empirical attempts to explain the well-documented increase in wage inequality that occurred in the United States in the 1980s and 1990s. We address this deficiency by assessing occupation-level effects on wage inequality using data from the Current Population Survey for 1983 through 2008. We model the mean and variance of wages for each occupation, controlling for education and demographic factors at the individual level to test three competing explanations for the increase in wage inequality: (1) the growth of between-occupation polarization, (2) changes in education and labor force composition, and (3) residual inequality unaccounted for by occupations and demographic characteristics. After correcting for a problem with imputed data that biased Kim and Sakamoto's (2008) results, we find that between-occupation changes explain 66 percent of the increase in wage inequality from 1992 to 2008, although 23 percent of this is due to the switch to the 2000 occupation codes in 2003. Sensitivity analysis reveals that 18 percent of the increase in inequality from 1983 to 2002 is due to changes in just three occupations: managers `'not elsewhere classified,'' secretaries, and computer systems analysts.	2	Ted Mouw; Arne L.

DeSoucey, Michaela. 2010. 'Gastronationalism: Food Traditions and Authenticity Politics in the European Union.' American Sociological Review. 75:3 432-455.	American Sociological Review	2010	12	By developing the concept of `'gastronationalism,'' this article challenges conceptions of the homogenizing forces of globalism. I analyze (1) the ways in which food production, distribution, and consumption can demarcate and sustain the emotive power of national attachment and (2) how nationalist sentiments, in turn, can shape the production and marketing of food. The multi-methodological analyses reveal how the construct of gastronationalism can help us better understand pan-national tensions in symbolic boundary politics-politics that protect certain foods and industries as representative of national cultural traditions. I first analyze the macro-level dimensions of market protections by examining the European Union's program for origin-designation labels that delineates particular foods as nationally owned. The micro-level, empirical case-the politics surrounding foie gras in France-demonstrates how gastronationalism functions as a protectionist mechanism within lived experience. Foie gras is an especially relevant case because other parties within the pan-national system consider it morally objectionable. Contemporary food politics, beyond the insights it affords into symbolic boundary politics, speaks to several arenas of sociological interest, including markets, identity politics, authenticity and culture, and the complexities of globalization.	1	Michaela DeSoucey
Pontikes, Elizabeth, Giacomo Negro & Hayagreeva Rao. 2010. 'Stained Red: a Study of Stigma by Association to Blacklisted Artists During the `'red Scare'' in Hollywood, 1945 to 1960.' American Sociological Review. 75:3 456-478.	American Sociological Review	2010	7	We suggest that moral panics exert spillover effects through stigma by mere association. Individuals are harmed even if their ties to stigmatized affiliates are heterophilous, and high-status individuals can also suffer. This creates a broadcast effect that increases the scale of the moral panic. Analyzing the U.S. film industry from 1945 to 1960, we examine how artists' employment in feature films was influenced by their associations with co-workers who were blacklisted as communists after working with the focal artist. Mere association reduces an artist's chances of working again, and one exposure is enough to impair work prospects. Furthermore, actors' careers are impaired when writers with whom they worked are blacklisted. Moreover, the negative effects of stigma by mere association hold even when the focal artist has received public acclaim. These findings have broad implications. When a few individuals or organizations are engaged in wrongdoing and publicly targeted, stigma by association can lead to false positives and harm many innocents.	3	Elizabeth Pontikes; Giacomo Negro; Hayagreeva Rao
Wynn, Jonathan. 2010. 'City Tour Guides: Urban Alchemists at Work.' City \& Community. 9:2 145-164.	City \& Community	2010	2	Urban sociology, often and quite reasonably, emphasizes the effects of large-scale and corporate cultures of cities and yet, at the smaller scale, there is a diverse and complex set of practices that reinvigorate the urban landscape. By pairing ethnographic fieldnotes with interviews, this paper offers a limited rejoinder to these narratives, evincing the lived interactions of one set of characters that reenchants cities. For the purposes of this article, walking tour guides serve as examples of ``urban alchemists,'' and three of their practices are advanced for discussion: their use of myths and revelatory stories to uproot banal visions of the city; their aim to incorporate chance and serendipity into their interactions; and their attempts to transform their participants into ``better'' urban dwellers.	1	Jonathan R.

Hunter, Marcus. 2010. 'the Nightly Round: Space, Social Capital, and Urban Black Nightlife.' City \& Community. 9:2 165-186.	City \& Community	2010	2	Using data generated from participant observation and semistructured interviews, I consider the ways in which nightlife, or what might be imagined as the nightly round-a process encompassing the social interactions, behaviors, and actions involved in going to, being in, and leaving the club-is used to mitigate the effects of social and spatial isolation, complementing the accomplishment of the daily round. Through an analysis of the social world of The Spot, I argue that understanding the ways in which urban blacks use space in the nightclub to mediate racial segregation, sexual segregation, and limited social capital expands our current understanding of the spatial mobility of urban blacks as well as the important role of extra-neighborhood spaces in such processes. Further, I highlight the ways that urban blacks use space in the nightclub to leverage socioeconomic opportunities and enhance social networks. While I found that black heterosexual and lesbian and gay patrons used space in similar ways at The Spot, black lesbians and gays were more likely to use the club as a space to develop ties of social support.	1	Marcus Anthony Hunter

City \& Community	2010	3	A case study of the renovation of New York City's Bryant Park, this article revisits the end of public space thesis. The renovated park signifies not the end of public space but the new ends to which public space is oriented. In Bryant Park, a new logic of urban publicity was assembled and built into the landscape. The social and technical means by which this transformation was achieved are analyzed. New public spaces of this sort promulgate a conception of the public that is decoupled from discourses of democratization, citizenship, and self-development and connected ever more firmly to consumption, commerce, and social surveillance. If such places do not herald the end of public space, they do represent ``publicity without democracy.''	1	David J. Madden
Capek, Stella. 2010. 'Foregrounding Nature: an Invitation to Think About Shifting Nature-city Boundaries.' City \& Community. 9:2 208-224.	City \& Community	2010	3	Although nature in the form of ``environment'' has sometimes been part of sociological discussions of the city, it is typically treated as background, as a social construction, or as a metaphor for social processes. Less familiar is a view of nature as an active participant in a relationship of codetermination, an ``actor'' that constructs outcomes along with human beings in the communities that they inhabit. In this essay, I explore this more agentic reading of nature, bringing together insights from environmental and urban/community sociology. I explore four areas in which taken-for-granted boundaries between nature and city are shifting: ecological restoration projects, human-animal interactions, ``postnatural'' environments of toxic pollution, and simulated/artificial environments that substitute for nature. I suggest that urban sociology would benefit from a socioecological approach that enriches our understanding of nature and city and that allows us to participate more fully in discussions of sustainability.	1	Stella M.

Ethnography	2010	4	This is an article about the difficulties of doing ethnography in relatively enclosed and secretive communities, based on my experience of trying to launch an ethnographic study of Hollywood. I consider (separately) the problems of doing participant observation in `inside' locations, and the problems of gaining access to industry insiders for interviews. In response to the problem of doing participant observation, I propose the practice of what I call `interface ethnography', attending events in which the closed institution presents itself to `the public'. In response to the problem of gaining access to insiders for interviews, I discuss the important role of the interviewee's `interest', whether practical or intellectual, in the project.	1	Sherry B.

Kramer, Ronald. 2010. 'Painting With Permission: Legal Graffiti in New York City.' Ethnography. 11:2 235-253.	Ethnography	2010	6	Drawing extensively from interviews conducted with 20 New York City graffiti writers and from unobtrusive observations, this article seeks to further our understanding of graffiti writing culture in two important respects. On the one hand, previous scholars have tended to explore graffiti writing as an illegal and/or criminalized (sub) culture. On the other, they have found it to be a practice that embodies a `critical' stance towards society. My findings indicate that since 1990 a subset of graffiti writers who paint with permission has emerged. Furthermore, I find that those who produce legal graffiti tend to lead lives and espouse values that most would not hesitate to recognize as `conventional'. I conclude by suggesting that graffiti writing needs to be acknowledged as a multifaceted and historically fluid culture, and by intimating some possible directions for further research.	1	Ronald Kramer
Rimmer, Mark. 2010. 'Listening to the Monkey: Class, Youth and the Formation of a Musical Habitus.' Ethnography. 11:2 255-283.	Ethnography	2010	0	This article explores the musical lives and music-related activities of a group of young people living on a deprived housing estate in North East England. Through the use of ethnography, I uncover how central aspects of these young people's taste for, and uses of, their preferred `new monkey' music function in respect of the values inscribed in their community's past, the problems and challenges facing them in the present, as well as their anticipations of the future. To help think through the complex and sometimes contradictory processes at work within these young musico-cultural lives, I employ and specifically adapt a key Bourdieusian concept to encouraging thinking about such issues in terms of a musical habitus. As an invitation to explore the nexus of personal, social and historical factors that conjoin music's possibilities with the contexts and conditions of lived practices, the concept of musical habitus reveals substantial explanatory potential.	1	Mark Rimmer
Hines, J.. 2010. 'in Pursuit of Experience: the Postindustrial Gentrification of the Rural American West.' Ethnography. 11:2 285-308.	Ethnography	2010	2	Contemporary rural gentrification - the colonization of rural communities and small-towns by members of the ex-urban middle class-is a nationwide phenomenon that contradicts nearly two centuries of US urbanization. While previous research primarily describes such counter-urbanization as representing a profound divergence from previous patterns (i.e. urbanization, mass production/consumption, etc.), I contend that rural gentrification is best understood as the product of both continuity and change relative to the ideas/practices of Modernity and current postindustrialization. Based on ethnographic research conducted in a community in south-central Montana, I present evidence that the choice by middle-class newcomers to migrate to the rural US is simultaneously the product of: 1) the continued efficacy of the Modern ideals of authenticity and progress; and 2) their aspirations to distinguish themselves as members of an emerging class faction-the postindustrial middle class (PIMC) - through their emphasis upon the production and consumption of experiences.	1	J.

Pagis, Michal. 2010. 'Producing Intersubjectivity in Silence: an Ethnographic Study of Meditation Practice.' Ethnography. 11:2 309-328.	Ethnography	2010	5	The `problem of other minds' is central to sociological theory and of immediate importance to contemporary research on subjectivity and interiority. How do we cultivate and maintain an intersubjective space during silent, private, experiences? Drawing on Alfred Schutz's phenomenology, this study challenges the common view which regards silence as an obstacle to social relations. The data consist of two years of participant observation of vipassana meditation practices in Israel and the United States. Vipassana meditation is conducted in complete silence, discouraging group sharing of meditation experiences, thus offering an extreme case of silence and privacy. The findings illustrate how, despite the absence of direct verbal communication, the practice of meditation still holds important intersubjective dimensions. I suggest that covert mechanisms of silent intersubjectivity play an important role in everyday social life and require further ethnographic attention.	1	Michal Pagis

Gender \& Society. 24:3 281-303.	Gender \& Society	2010	16	This article integrates research on gendered organizations and the work-family interface to investigate an innovative workplace initiative, the Results-Only Work Environment (ROWE), implemented in the corporate headquarters of Best Buy, Inc. While flexible work policies common in other organizations ``accommodate'' individuals, this initiative attempts a broader and deeper critique of the organizational culture. We address two research questions: How does this initiative attempt to change the masculinized ideal worker norm? And what do women's and men's responses reveal about the persistent ways that gender structures work and family life? Data demonstrate the ideal worker norm is pervasive and powerful, even as employees begin critically examining expectations regarding work time that have historically privileged men. Employees' responses to ROWE are also gendered. Women (especially mothers) are more enthusiastic, while men are more cautious. Ambivalence about and resistance to change is expressed in different ways depending on gender and occupational status.	4	Erin L. Kelly; Samantha K. Ammons; Kelly Chermack; Phyllis Moen
Schalet, Amy. 2010. 'Sexual Subjectivity Revisited the Significance of Relationships in Dutch and American Girls' Experiences of Sexuality.' Gender \& Society. 24:3 304-329.	Gender \& Society	2010	9	In-depth interviews with white middle-class Dutch and American girls demonstrate two important differences in the cultural beliefs and processes that shape their negotiation of heterosexuality. First, Dutch girls are able to integrate their sexual selves into their relationships with their parents, while reconciling sexuality with daughterhood is difficult for the American girls. Second, American girls face adult and peer cultures skeptical about whether teenagers can sustain the feelings and relationships that legitimate sexual activity, while Dutch girls are assumed to be able to fall in love and form steady sexual relationships. This research suggests important differences in institutionalized forms of heterosexuality. It also suggests the significance of girls' relationships, and the cultural perceptions and processes that shape those relationships, for their sexual subjectivity.	1	Amy Schalet
Thebaud, Sarah. 2010. 'Masculinity, Bargaining, and Breadwinning Understanding Men's Housework in the Cultural Context of Paid Work.' Gender \& Society. 24:3 330-354.	Gender \& Society	2010	11	This research uses data from 18 countries to investigate cross-national differences in the effect that men's income relative to their spouses has on their involvement in housework. The author hypothesizes that gender expectations will be more salient in men's household bargaining in contexts where the traditionally masculine and breadwinning-related activities of paid work and earning income are highly valued. Results from analyses of International Social Survey Program (ISSP) data support this hypothesis: Men's behavior is more consistent with a gender deviance neutralization account than an exchange-bargaining account in cultural contexts where paid work and income are highly valued. The analyses point to the role that expectations about masculinity play in men's involvement in housework and highlight the significance of cultural context for understanding the link between paid and unpaid work.	1	Sarah Thebaud
Ronen, Shelly. 2010. 'Grinding on the Dance Floor Gendered Scripts and Sexualized Dancing at College Parties.' Gender \& Society. 24:3 355-377.	Gender \& Society	2010	4	In this article, the author explores the gendered dynamics of ``grinding,'' sexualized dancing common at college parties. Drawing on the observations of student participant observers, the author describes the common script for initiating this behavior. At these parties, men initiated more often and more directly than women, whose behaviors were shaped by a sexual double standard and (hetero-) relational imperative. The heterosexual grinding script enacts a gendered dynamic that reproduces systematic gender inequality by limiting women's access to sexual agency and pleasure, privileging men's pleasure and confirming their higher status.	1	Shelly Ronen
Springer, Kristen. 2010. 'Economic Dependence in Marriage and Husbands' Midlife Health Testing Three Possible Mechanisms.' Gender \& Society. 24:3 378-401.	Gender \& Society	2010	0	Prior research suggests that midlife husbands have worse health when they earn less than their wives; however, the mechanism(s) for this relationship have not been evaluated. In this study, the author analyzes 1,319 heterosexual married couples from the Health and Retirement Study to explore three theoretically grounded mechanisms. The author begins by assessing two well-established family relations theories (economic resource and marital dissatisfaction) to explore the mediating effect of marital power and relationship quality. The author then draws from gender relations theory, multiple masculinities literature, and cognitive dissonance research to test the possibility of a male breadwinner mechanism. The results demonstrate that family relations theories are insufficient explanations but provide strong support for the male breadwinner mechanism. Specifically, being the secondary earner is harmful for the health of highest-income men-who historically have the strongest expectation of male breadwinning. These findings suggest that stereotypes about male breadwinning can be dangerous for men's health.	1	Kristen W. Springer
Anton, Jose-Ignacio. 2010. 'the Impact of Remittances on Nutritional Status of Children in Ecuador1.' International Migration Review. 44:2 269-299.	International Migration Review	2010	3	This work analyzes the impact of remittances on nutritional status of children aged < 5 years old in Ecuador in 2006. Using a set of anthropometric indicators constructed according to the new World Health Organization standards, the last household survey available for this country, and an instrumental variables strategy controlling for endogeneity of remittances, this study finds a positive and significant effect of remittance income on short-term and middle-term child nutritional status; nevertheless, no significant impact on long-run anthropometric indicators.	1	Jose-Ignacio Anton
Arguillas, Marie & Lindy Williams. 2010. 'the Impact of Parents' Overseas Employment on Educational Outcomes of Filipino Children.' International Migration Review. 44:2 300-319.	International Migration Review	2010	5	Family structure, household resources, numbers of siblings competing for those resources, and parents' own educational attainment are often important predictors of children's education outcomes. Overseas migration of parents from the Philippines has resulted in increasing numbers of long-term separations of parents from each other and from their children. Western-based analyses might predict negative education outcomes for children as a result of parental absence. We find that separations caused by overseas migration often are either neutral or can have positive effects on schooling outcomes, at least among older children. Girls fare better in terms of educational attainment than do boys overall. Boys are often more affected by background variables, including parents' international migration.	2	Marie Joy Arguillas; Lindy Williams
Bonikowska, Aneta & Feng Hou. 2010. 'Reversal of Fortunes or Continued Success? Cohort Differences in Education and Earnings of Childhood Immigrants1.' International Migration Review. 44:2 320-353.	International Migration Review	2010	1	Using several years of Canadian census data, this study examines cohort differences in educational attainment and earnings among childhood immigrants who arrived in Canada between 1960 and 1989. Successive cohorts of childhood immigrants had increasingly higher university completion rates than their Canadian-born peers by age 25-34. We find that this lead was tempered by declining earnings of immigrant parents relative to Canadian-born parents, particularly among the 1980s cohort. Despite rising university completion rates, wages of male (but not female) childhood immigrants lagged behind those of their Canadian-born peers. This gap can be accounted for largely by the rising share of members of racial minority groups and the decreasing incidence of full-time employment.	2	Aneta Bonikowska; Feng Hou
Sevoyan, Arusyak & Victor Agadjanian. 2010. 'Male Migration, Women Left Behind, and Sexually Transmitted Diseases in Armenia.' International Migration Review. 44:2 354-375.	International Migration Review	2010	2	The effect of male circular labor migration on risks of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) among women left behind has not been well studied. Our study examines this effect using data from a survey of 1,240 married women in rural Armenia, where international male labor migration has traditionally been very common. A multivariate comparison of women married to migrants and women married to non-migrants finds that the former, ceteris paribus, reported more STD symptoms, on average, and were more likely to report diagnosed STDs than the latter. However, in the case of STD symptoms, this effect is moderated by household income, as the predicted number of STD symptoms reported by migrants' wives increases as income rises. The findings illustrate the complex tradeoffs that migration entails for left-behind women and are interpreted in the context of the literature on gender, migration, and STDs.	2	Arusyak Sevoyan; Victor Agadjanian
Vroome, Thomas & Frank Tubergen. 2010. 'the Employment Experience of Refugees in the Netherlands1.' International Migration Review. 44:2 376-403.	International Migration Review	2010	3	This study focuses on the economically disadvantaged position of refugees. We use survey data of refugees from Somalia, Iran, Afghanistan, Iraq, and the former Yugoslavia in the Netherlands, to analyze refugees' odds of employment and their occupational status. In line with human capital and social capital theory, we find that host country specific education, work experience, language proficiency, and contacts with natives are positively related to the chances of employment and occupational status. The study shows that health problems, integration courses, and the time spent in refugee reception centers form important additional explanations of the economic integration of refugees.	2	Thomas Vroome; Frank Tubergen
Preibisch, Kerry. 2010. 'Pick-your-own Labor: Migrant Workers and Flexibility in Canadian Agriculture1.' International Migration Review. 44:2 404-441.	International Migration Review	2010	5	This paper explores the structures and practices of temporary migrant worker programs (TMWP) as they operate in Canadian agriculture. Acting within highly competitive, globalized markets, agri-food employers rely on the availability of migrant workers to achieve greater flexibility in their labor arrangements, drawing on employment practices beyond those possible with a domestic workforce. Most recently, changes to Canada's two TMWP schemes have provided employers with greater scope to shape the social composition of their workforce. The paper analyzes these changes while exploring their implications for workplace regimes in agriculture.	1	Kerry Preibisch
Painter, Gary & Zhou Yu. 2010. 'Immigrants and Housing Markets in Mid-size Metropolitan Areas1.' International Migration Review. 44:2 442-476.	International Migration Review	2010	7	The recent trend of immigrants arriving in mid-size metropolitan areas has received growing attention in the literature. This study examines the success of immigrants in the housing markets of a sample of 60 metropolitan areas using Census microdata in both 2000 and 2005. The results suggest that immigrants are less successful in achieving homeownership and more likely to live in overcrowded conditions than native-born whites of non-Hispanic origin. The immigrant effect on homeownership differs by geography and by immigrant group. Finally, we find evidence that immigrant networks increase the likelihood of becoming a homeowner.	2	Gary Painter; Zhou Yu
Jasso, Guillermina, Vivek Wadhwa, Gary Gereffi, Ben Rissing & Richard Freeman. 2010. 'How Many Highly Skilled Foreign-born Are Waiting in Line for Us Legal Permanent Residence?1.' International Migration Review. 44:2 477-498.	International Migration Review	2010	4	While the United States welcomes foreign-born students and trainees and, less warmly, temporary workers such as H-1B visa holders, it places an array of requirements, obstacles, and delays upon persons who would like to make the U.S. their permanent home. The number of people in the queue for legal permanent residence (LPR) is, however, difficult to ascertain. This paper estimates the number of highly skilled foreign-born persons waiting for LPR via the three main employment-based categories, separately by whether they are living in the United States or abroad, as well as the number of family members. We find that as of the end of FY 2006 there were about half a million employment-based principals awaiting LPR in the United States, together with over half a million family members, plus over 125 thousand principals and family members waiting abroad. These numbers dwarf the visas available annually - 120,120 plus any not used in the family preferences - suggesting that the long delays in gaining legal permanent residence are a visa number problem, not an administrative processing problem, as many believe. The backlog thus cannot be eliminated without a large change in public policy. The delay in gaining legal permanent residence could contribute to the decision of many highly skilled foreign-born to leave the United States.	5	Guillermina Jasso; Vivek Wadhwa; Gary Gereffi; Ben Rissing; Richard Freeman
Marti, Gerardo. 2010. 'the Religious Racial Integration of African Americans Into Diverse Churches.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:2 201-217.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	4	Recent scholarship asserts that members of racial groups can transcend their ethnic differences, but other research asserts that ethnoracial identities must be reinforced in order to participate in multiracial churches. Analysis of field notes and interview data from a large, black-white Protestant congregation shows that while the core membership of African Americans come specifically for its ethnic and racial diversity, they also look for markers that affirm a distinctive African-American experience. Ethnic reinforcement attracts highly race-conscious participants who eventually move toward processes of ethnic transcendence and congregational integration. The value for researchers is that distinguishing ethnically transcendent and ethnically reinforcing processes encourages the discovery of subtle, racially specific, and continually reinforced affinities that would otherwise remain hidden in seemingly ethnically transcendent settings.	1	Gerardo Marti
Merino, Stephen. 2010. 'Religious Diversity in a ``christian Nation'': the Effects of Theological Exclusivity and Interreligious Contact on the Acceptance of Religious Diversity.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:2 231-246.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	4	Using data from the nationally representative Religion and Diversity Survey, Americans' responses to religious diversity are examined at the national and community levels. While an overwhelming majority of Americans agree that religious diversity has been good for the nation, support for the inclusion of non-Christians in community life is mixed. Theological exclusivism is consistently and strongly associated with negative attitudes toward religious diversity and less willingness to include Muslims and Hindus in community life. Belief that the United States is a Christian nation is associated with a positive view of religious diversity but decreased willingness to include Muslims in community life. Prior contact with Muslims, Buddhists, and Hindus is predictive of more positive views of religious diversity; contact with Muslims is associated with greater tolerance for a mosque in one's community.	1	Stephen M.

Smits, Fransje, Stijn Ruiter & Frank Tubergen. 2010. 'Religious Practices Among Islamic Immigrants: Moroccan and Turkish Men in Belgium.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:2 247-263.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	13	This study examines the religious participation of Islamic immigrants in Belgium using data from the Migration History and Social Mobility Survey collected in 1994-1996 from 2,200 men who had immigrated from Turkey and Morocco. Religious participation is measured as mosque attendance, fasting during Ramadan, and sacrificing a sheep at the Festival of Sacrifice. Results show that the religious participation of Islamic immigrants depends on both premigration and postmigration characteristics. Religious participation is higher among immigrants who: (1) attended a Koranic school in their country of origin, (2) were socialized in a religious region of their home country, (3) received little schooling, (4) currently live in an area of Belgium with a greater number of mosques, and (5) associate with a high number of co-ethnics. These results suggest that the religious participation of Islamic immigrants in Belgium is an outcome of characteristics unique to immigrants as well as processes common among the general population.	3	Fransje Smits; Stijn Ruiter; Frank Tubergen

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:2 264-277.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	4	Hood developed a Mysticism Scale based on the theoretical work of Stace. The scale was tested by Hood and others in a comparative perspective. Using an abridged version of Hood's Mysticism Scale, we join the debate with a study of a much larger number of Christian, Muslim, and Hindu respondents (1,920 college students) living in Tamil Nadu, India. Our empirical analysis yields a moderately reliable model of mystical experience that permits comparison between the three religious traditions. We argue for the usefulness of a comparative model of vertical mysticism that combines with the complementary common characteristics of noetic quality and ineffability. Vertical mysticism has a revelatory, ineffable character and is comparable in the experience of adherents of the Christian, Islamic, and Hindu traditions.	3	Francis-Vincent Anthony; Chris A.

Jenkins, Kathleen. 2010. 'in Concert and Alone: Divorce and Congregational Experience.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:2 278-292.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	2	Sociologists have paid little attention to the experience of divorce in religious congregations. Numerous quantitative studies suggest that religion can provide health and wellness during such life disruptions, but we know little about the social and individual processes that might foster these benefits. I address this gap in the literature drawing from data collected in a four-year ethnographic study of divorce and ending life partnerships across six religious traditions. I analyze the experiences of 41 individuals who ended life partnerships while active in their congregations. Despite intense points of communal connection through ritual, respondents named largely private strategies for settling heightened emotion, physical and psychological pain, and creating a new self. Permeating their communal experiences was a marked sense of aloneness, resulting from individual shame and congregational silence, as well as their understanding of divorce-work as ultimately private self-work.	1	Kathleen E.

Skirbekk, Vegard, Eric Kaufmann & Anne Goujon. 2010. 'Secularism, Fundamentalism, or Catholicism? the Religious Composition of the United States to 2043.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:2 293-310.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	7	We provide a cohort-component projection of the religious composition of the United States, considering differences in fertility, migration, intergenerational religious transmission, and switching among 11 ethnoreligious groups. If fertility and migration trends continue, Hispanic Catholics will experience rapid growth and expand from 10 to 18 percent of the American population between 2003 and 2043. Protestants are projected to decrease from 47 to 39 percent over the same period, while Catholicism emerges as the largest religion among the youngest age cohorts. Liberal Protestants decline relative to other groups due to low fertility and losses from religious switching. Immigration drives growth among Hindus and Muslims, while low fertility and a mature age structure causes Jewish decline. The low fertility of secular Americans and the religiosity of immigrants provide a countervailing force to secularization, causing the nonreligious population share to peak before 2043.	3	Vegard Skirbekk; Eric Kaufmann; Anne Goujon

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	8	Period and cohort effects on reports of no religious preference and religious disaffiliation are estimated. Results show that by 2006, the probability of reporting no religious preference had risen to almost .16. Additionally, the growing proportion of Americans raised with no religious preference substantially influences the increase in reporting no religious preference. Two recently developed analysis techniques for disentangling period and cohort effects are used: intrinsic estimator models and cross-classified, random-effects models. Results show (1) period-based increases in the probability of reporting no religious preference from 1990 to 2006, (2) across-cohort increases in no religious preference beginning with those born in the 1940s, and (3) a decline in the likelihood of religious disaffiliation (being raised with a religious preference but currently reporting no religious preference) for those born in the 1960s and 1970s compared to those born between 1945 and 1959.	1	Philip Schwadel

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	1	Korea may provide an important testing ground for assessing religious growth as a correlate of religious authority. In Korea from 1985 to 1995, all religious groups experienced growth, but from 1995 to 2005 only the Catholic population did so. Favorable images of Korean Catholicism compared to other Korean religions point to one factor that may account for this trend, namely, confidence in religious leaders. Up to now there has been no empirical test measuring confidence in religious leaders among different religious groups in Korea. Using the 2003-2007 Korean General Social Surveys cumulative data, we found a hierarchy of confidence in religious leaders ranging from highest to lowest as follows: Catholics, Protestants, Buddhists, no religion. Our finding may suggest the continued vitality of Catholicism in Korea.	3	Jibum Kim; Sang-Wook Kim; Jeong-Han Kang

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:2 328-350.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	3	Five competing explanations for why white evangelicals hold right-of-center political attitudes are examined using data from the 2000-2004 National Election Studies. Dependent variables include attitudes about abortion, homosexuality, immigration, national defense, and social spending. The five competing explanations accounting for conservative positions are: religiosity, moral standards traditionalism, gender and family ideology, class culture, and cultural geography. Moral standards traditionalism attenuated the evangelical effect on attitudes about abortion, homosexuality, and social spending. Religiosity and male-dominant gender ideology attenuated the effect on abortion and homosexuality only. In a second set of models, which include members of all major religious groups, these three variables, together with low levels of education, were significantly associated with conservative attitudes. Moral standards traditionalism demonstrated the most consistent, and generally the strongest, effects across dependent variables.	2	Steven Brint; Seth Abrutyn

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	4	Media outlets and observers of American religion suggest that young evangelicals are retreating from the ranks of the ``Christian right'' and are embracing more liberal positions on controversial social issues. We test this hypothesis using the Baylor Religion Survey. We examine two separate measures of evangelical identity as well as a wide variety of political identifications and attitudes. Our study indicates that young evangelicals (1) are significantly more likely than older evangelicals to think that more should be done to protect the environment; (2) hold views similar to older evangelicals regarding abortion, same-sex marriage, stem cell research, marijuana use, government welfare spending, spending on the nation's health, and the war in Iraq; and (3) remain significantly more conservative than nonevangelicals on these same social issues. We find no strong evidence to support the notion that young evangelicals are retreating from traditional positions or increasingly adopting more liberal positions on hot-button or controversial social issues.	2	Buster G.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	0	During an initial period of rapid expansion, American Spiritualists did not form churches or settle ministers. As a result, something other than numbers and locations of churches and ministers must chart the 19th-century rise of this religious movement. Fortunately, the leading Spiritualist newspaper of the period, the Banner of Light, published extensive lists of public meetings, lectures, and prospective lecturers. In addition, both the Banner and the Spiritual Telegraph newspapers published early lists of their subscription agents. Even though they do not directly address the central Spiritualist activity of the seance, these lists offer a detailed view of where and when the initial and rapid growth of American Spiritualist activity occurred. Data gathered from these lists put explanations about the rise of this 19th-century Spiritualist movement on a better empirical foundation.	1	David K. Nartonis

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	7	Based on three years of ethnographic research in a large, mixed-practice veterinary hospital and semistructured interviews with twenty-two veterinary technicians, this discussion focuses on the work of veterinary technicians, which is, as described by Everett Hughes (1984, 343), ``physically disgusting,'' `` a symbol of degradation,'' and `` wound(ing to) one's dignity.'' The article briefly describes the vet tech's career and work activities. The discussion then focuses on how technicians regard and deal with the least appealing of their physical and emotional tasks. Here I emphasize the compensatory role played by the relationships and encounters with nonhuman animals that are central to their work life. The article concludes with an examination of the concept of dirty work and the relationship between dirty work and identity.	1	Clinton R. Sanders
Decker, Stephanie. 2010. 'Being Period: an Examination of Bridging Discourse in a Historical Reenactment Group.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 39:3 273-296.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	1	An ethnography found that when members of a historical reenactment group behave in ways that seem inconsistent with the group's ideology, they engage in discourse to demonstrate to other members that their behavior is congruent with the group's ideology and, in doing so, strengthen connections with other members who have different standards for behavior or different interpretations of the group's ideology. The term bridging discourse is introduced to refer to this practice. Bridging discourse is useful for members of the historical reenactment group, as authenticity is an important but ambiguous part of the group's ideology, and it is not always clear what behavior is authentic and what behavior is not. Members use bridging discourse to demonstrate to other members that a wide range of behavior can be considered authentic. Individuals engage in bridging discourse by redefining the group's ideology, reinterpreting behavior, and making exceptions to the group's normative standards. Such discourse ultimately allows the group to survive with a diverse membership.	1	Stephanie K. Decker
Denissen, Amy. 2010. 'Crossing the Line: How Women in the Building Trades Interpret and Respond to Sexual Conduct at Work.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 39:3 297-327.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	3	A significant number of women who experience sexual conduct in the workplace do not define it as sexual harassment. This has caused a discrepancy between social science measures of sexual harassment and women's perceptions and experiences. As a consequence, studies have begun to examine how workers distinguish between wanted and unwanted sexual behavior. Through in-depth interviews and ethnographic fieldwork with women who work in the building trades, this study examines how tradeswomen interpret and respond to the sexual conduct of their coworkers. Using a micro-politics of trouble framework, the author shows how interpretations of sexual conduct are shaped up exactly in the process of responding to problematic interactions. The analysis finds that many initial responses to unwanted sexual conduct attempt to restore good relations between coworkers. However, if the sexual conduct is considered extreme or if initial attempts to resolve the trouble are unsuccessful, the actions may be reinterpreted and responded to informally as actions that ``cross the line'' even as tradeswomen face constraints in exercising formal punitive measures.	1	Amy M.

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 39:3 328-353.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	1	Drawing on reflection, nonparticipant and participant observation, and introspection this article examines the performative dimensions of sound, arguing that sounds of both the nonsemioticized and semioticized variety function as acts, not unlike speech acts. Through a layered text, the article offers analytical reflections and evocative writing focused on the exploration of acoustic environments such as movie theatres, airplanes, street music performances, residential neighborhoods, and more. An important material property of sound acts, elocution, is identified, conceptualized, and examined. Elocutionary sound acts are also examined as social dramas, insofar as they constitute a crisis-ensuing breach of what the authors refer to as the somatic order. The maintenance of, or alignment on, the rules prevalent within a defined somatic order is also examined and discussed. As a whole, the sensuous performative dynamics that sound acts and somatic alignment entail can be referred to as instances of somatic work.	4	Phillip Vannini; Dennis Waskul; Simon Gottschalk; Carol Rambo
Quadagno, Jill. 2010. 'Institutions, Interest Groups, and Ideology: an Agenda for the Sociology of Health Care Reform.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:2 125-136.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	4	A central sociological premise is that health care systems are organizations that are embedded within larger institutions, which have been shaped by historical precedents and operate within a specific cultural context. Although bound by policy legacies, embedded constituencies, and path dependent processes, health care systems are not rigid, static, and impervious to change. The success of health care reform in 2010 has shown that existing regimes do have the capacity to respond to new needs in ways that transcend their institutional and ideological limits. For the United States the question is how health care reform will reconfigure the existing network of public and private benefits and the power relationships between the numerous constituencies surrounding them. This article considers how institutions, interest groups, and ideology have affected the organization of the health care system in the United States as well as in other nations. It then discusses issues for future research in the aftermath of the 2009-10 health care reform debate.	1	Jill Quadagno
Menchik, Daniel & David Meltzer. 2010. 'the Cultivation of Esteem and Retrieval of Scientific Knowledge in Physician Networks.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:2 137-152.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	2	This article evaluates how physicians draw upon scientific and other forms of knowledge in different professional communities. We argue that because physicians will draw upon clinical research findings to improve their reputation with colleagues, and because the terms for accruing esteem in an academic hospital may differ depending on the dominant task structure of the organization, the form of knowledge that is valued by a physician will vary with his or her hospital's level of prestige. We use social network and multivariate analyses to test this theory in six U. S. hospitals with varying levels of prestige. We find that in lower-prestige hospitals, physicians can improve their reputation by reading a relatively broad range of scientific journals, whereas in higher-prestige hospitals, esteem is allocated to those with a more elite medical school pedigree. Statistically significant differences also exist between hospitals in terms of whether work with patients is valued, with physicians who engage in more clinical activity in the highest-ranked hospitals receiving less esteem from their colleagues. We finish by discussing how the functioning of higher- and lower-prestige hospitals is interconnected in ways that sustain both the development of innovations and their widespread adoption.	2	Daniel A.

Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:2 153-167.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	12	This study used longitudinal data from 909 young adults to examine associations between substance use and the status and quality of romantic relationships. Heavy alcohol use, marijuana use, and cigarette smoking, as well as relationship status, relationship quality, partner substance use, and other salient life circumstances were assessed at four time points in the two years after high school. Marriage, cohabiting relationships, and noncohabiting dating relationships were associated with reductions in heavy drinking and marijuana use relative to non-dating, after adjusting for adolescent substance use; marriage compared to not dating was associated with reductions in cigarette smoking. For those in romantic relationships, partner substance use moderated the associations between relationship quality and substance use for heavy drinking and for marijuana use, supporting the hypothesis derived from the Social Development Model that the protective effect of stronger social bonds depends on the use patterns of the partner to whom an individual is bonded.	3	Charles B.

Simon, Robin & Anne Barrett. 2010. 'Nonmarital Romantic Relationships and Mental Health in Early Adulthood: Does the Association Differ for Women and Men?.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:2 168-182.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	10	Although social scientists have long assumed that intimate social relationships are more closely associated with women's than men's mental health, recent research indicates that there are no gender differences in the advantages of marriage and disadvantages of unmarried statuses when males' and females' distinct expressions of emotional distress are considered. These findings have led to the conclusion that there has been a convergence in the importance of intimate relationships for men's and women's mental health. However, these patterns may not be evident for nonmarital romantic relationships among current cohorts of young adults. In this article, we examine the associations among several dimensions of these relationships and symptoms of both depression and substance abuse/dependence in a diverse sample of young adults in Miami, Florida. We find gender differences that vary across dimensions of relationships: While current involvements and recent breakups are more closely associated with women's than men's mental health, support and strain in an ongoing relationship are more closely associated with men's than women's emotional well-being. Our findings highlight the need to consider the period in the life course as well as experiences of specific cohorts of men and women when theorizing about gender differences in the importance of intimate relationships for mental health.	2	Robin W.

Pai, Manacy & Deborah Carr. 2010. 'Do Personality Traits Moderate the Effect of Late-life Spousal Loss on Psychological Distress?.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:2 183-199.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	7	We use data from the Changing Lives of Older Couples (CLOC) study to investigate the extent to which: (1) five personality traits (agreeableness, conscientiousness, emotional stability/neuroticism, extraversion, and openness) moderate the effect of late-life spousal loss on depressive symptoms; (2) these patterns vary based on the expectedness of the death; and (3) the patterns documented in (1) and (2) are explained by secondary stressors and social support. Widowed persons report significantly more depressive symptoms than married persons, yet the deleterious effects of loss are significantly smaller for highly extraverted and conscientious individuals. The protective effects of personality traits, however, vary based on the expectedness of the death. Extraversion is protective against depression only for persons who had forewarning of the death. Extraverts may be particularly good at marshalling social support during prolonged periods of spousal illness. We discuss the ways that extraversion and conscientiousness may buffer against bereavement-related stressors.	2	Manacy Pai; Deborah Carr
Hook, Jennifer & Elizabeth Baker. 2010. 'Big Boys and Little Girls: Gender, Acculturation, and Weight Among Young Children of Immigrants.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:2 200-214.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	11	Previous research fails to find a consistent association between obesity and acculturation for children. We theorize that social isolation shelters children of immigrants from the U. S. ``obesiogenic'' environment, but this protective effect is offset by immigrant parents' limited capacity to identify and manage this health risk in the United States. We further theorize that these factors affect boys more than girls. We use data from over 20,000 children in the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study Kindergarten Cohort and find that boys whose parents were raised outside the United States weighed more and gained weight faster than any other group. However, within this group, sons of low English-proficient parents gained weight more slowly than sons of English-proficient parents. The results thus suggest that two dimensions of low acculturation-foreign place of socialization and social isolation-affect children's weight gain in opposite directions and are more important for boys than girls.	2	Jennifer Hook; Elizabeth Baker
Frisco, Michelle, Jason Houle & Molly Martin. 2010. 'the Image in the Mirror and the Number on the Scale: Weight, Weight Perceptions, and Adolescent Depressive Symptoms.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:2 215-228.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	5	Double jeopardy and health congruency theories suggest that adolescents' joint experience of their weight and weight perceptions are associated with depressive symptoms, but each theory offers a different prediction about which adolescents are at greatest risk. This study investigates the proposed associations and the applicability of both theoretical perspectives using data from 6,557 male and 6,126 female National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) Wave II participants. Empirically, results indicate that focusing on the intersection of weight and weight perceptions better shows which adolescents are at risk of depressive symptoms than an approach that treats both predictors as independent, unrelated constructs. Weight pessimists are at greatest risk of depressive symptoms. Thus, results support the health congruency framework, its extension to subpopulations outside of older adults, and its extension to optimism and pessimism about specific health conditions.	3	Michelle L.

Cherlin, Andrew. 2010. 'Demographic Trends in the United States: a Review of Research in the 2000s.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:3 403-419.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	52	Demographic trends in the 2000s showed the continuing separation of family and household because of factors such as childbearing among single parents, the dissolution of cohabiting unions, divorce, repartnering, and remarriage. The transnational families of many immigrants also displayed this separation, as families extended across borders. In addition, demographers demonstrated during the decade that trends such as marriage and divorce were diverging according to education. Moreover, demographic trends in the age structure of the population showed that a large increase in the elderly population will occur in the 2010s. Overall, demographic trends produced an increased complexity of family life and a more ambiguous and fluid set of categories than demographers are accustomed to measuring.	1	Andrew J. Cherlin
Ferree, Myra. 2010. 'Filling the Glass: Gender Perspectives on Families.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:3 420-439.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	21	The challenge feminist scholarship posed to family studies has been largely met through the incorporation of research on gender dynamics within families and intersectional differences among them. Despite growing attention to gender as performance and power in more diverse families, the more difficult work of understanding the dynamics of change among institutions including the family and using intersectional analyses to unpack relationships of power is only beginning. Reviewing the contributions researchers have made in these areas over the last decade and applying the idea of circuits to the study of care work, this article points to promising practices for both improving research on gender and families and contributing to the slow drip of institutional change.	1	Myra Marx Ferree

Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:3 440-459.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	18	In the millennium's inaugural decade, 2 interrelated trends influenced research on America's families of color: the need for new knowledge about America's growing ethnic/racial minority and immigrant populations and conceptual advances in critical race theories and perspectives on colorism. Three substantive areas reflecting researchers' interests in these trends emerged as the most frequently studied topics about families of color: inequality and socioeconomic mobility within and across families, interracial romantic pairings, and the racial socialization of children. In this review, we synthesize and critique the decade's scholarly literature on these topics. We devote special attention to advances in knowledge made by family-relevant research that incorporated ways of thinking from critical race theories and the conceptual discourse on colorism.	5	Linda M.

Edin, Kathryn & Rebecca Kissane. 2010. 'Poverty and the American Family: a Decade in Review.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:3 460-479.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	10	Because of dramatic levels of economic volatility and massive changes in welfare policies, scholars in this decade worried anew about whether our official poverty measure, adopted in the 1960s, is adequate. Poverty's causes continued to be debated, with demographic factors often pitted against policy and maternal employment changes. Some scholars focused on events that trigger spirals into poverty or poverty exits. The literature on consequences of poverty featured new techniques for identifying underlying processes and mechanisms. Researchers also explored ``neighborhood effects'' and focused on poverty deconcentration efforts. Finally, scholars produced a voluminous literature on the efforts to reform welfare and their subsequent effects.	2	Kathryn Edin; Rebecca Joyce Kissane
Biblarz, Timothy & Evren Savci. 2010. 'Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Families.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:3 480-497.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	17	This article reviews new scholarship on lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender families. The past decade witnessed rapid expansion of data and strong research designs. The most notable advance was in studies on variation among mostly planned lesbian comother families. Cumulative evidence suggests that although many of these families have comparatively high levels of shared labor and parental investment, they may not be as ``genderless'' as previously depicted. Gay men's diverse paths to family formation and planned parenthood have also been explored, but almost no research studies their children's experiences. Conceptualizations of sexual orientation expanded to include bisexuals and others, and some understanding of the experiences of transgender people has begun to emerge. Future work should explore relationships among members of the families they create.	2	Timothy J. Biblarz; Evren Savci
Glick, Jennifer. 2010. 'Connecting Complex Processes: a Decade of Research on Immigrant Families.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:3 498-515.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	13	This review examines research on immigrant families in the United States from the past decade from multiple disciplinary perspectives. This work has used variations on assimilation and acculturation perspectives. In the case of the assimilation perspectives, the focus has largely been on family formation, whereas research using acculturation perspectives has focused more on intrafamily relationships. But, over the course of the decade, an interesting integrative model has emerged to address interactions of attitudes and values with structural conditions in the receiving and sending communities. Some of this effort to integrate perspectives can be found in studies of transnational families. The review concludes with some suggestions for continuing this integration and expanding studies to include dynamics of migration and family processes simultaneously.	1	Jennifer E. Glick

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	15	We review comparative evidence of institutional effects on families in Western societies. We focus on 2 key aspects of family life: gendered divisions of labor and people's transitions into, within, and out of relationships. Many individual-level models assume the effects are robust across countries. The international evidence over the past decade suggests instead that the socioeconomic and policy contexts strongly influence the significance and even direction of individual effects. A growing body of evidence also highlights important differences across social groups and family forms within countries. The pattern of relative gender, class, and other group equality varies across countries, as do related family experiences and outcomes. We conclude with suggestions for future comparative family research.	2	Lynn Prince Cooke; Janeen Baxter

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	9	War and terrorism are exerting increasing force on world affairs, with growing implications for families and the scholars who study them. In this review, I consider the implications of mass violence for families, with particular emphasis on families with members serving in the U. S. military and families around the world who live where mass violence occurs. Mass violence poses significant threats to mental health and family functioning, but individuals and families also display striking levels of resilience.	1	Shelley M. Wadsworth
Sassler, Sharon. 2010. 'Partnering Across the Life Course: Sex, Relationships, and Mate Selection.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:3 557-575.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	20	Marital delay, relationship dissolution and churning, and high divorce rates have extended the amount of time individuals in search of romantic relationships spend outside of marital unions. The scope of research on intimate partnering now includes studies of ``hooking up,'' Internet dating, visiting relationships, cohabitation, marriage following childbirth, and serial partnering, as well as more traditional research on transitions into marriage. Collectively, we know much more about relationship formation and development, but research often remains balkanized among scholars employing different theoretical approaches, methodologies, or disciplinary perspectives. The study of relationship behavior is also segmented into particular life stages, with little attention given to linkages between stages over the life course. Recommendations for future research are offered.	1	Sharon Sassler

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	14	This review examines and synthesizes recent research on pathways to parenthood. We begin by providing basic information about patterns, differentials, and trends and discussing adoption and new reproductive technologies. We next turn to several areas of inquiry that became particularly prominent in the last decade: the continued ``decoupling'' of marriage and childbearing, the parental relationship context of nonmarital childbearing, family structure stability, multiple partner fertility, and racial and ethnic variation in childbearing patterns. We then consider the implications of this body of scholarship and identify avenues for future research. Throughout, we highlight racial/ethnic and social class variation in childbearing patterns.	2	Pamela J. Smock; Fiona Rose Greenland

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	12	This decade's literature on families with children and adolescents can be broadly organized around the implications for youth of family statuses (e.g., family structure) and family processes (e.g., parenting). These overlapping bodies of research built on past work by emphasizing the dynamic nature of family life and the intersection of families with other ecological settings, exploring race/ethnic diversity, identifying mechanisms connecting family and child/adolescent factors, and taking steps to address the threats to causal inference that have long been a problem for family studies. Continuing these trends in the future will be valuable, as will increasing the number of international comparisons, exploring ``new'' kinds of family diversity, and capturing the convergence of multiple statuses and processes over time.	2	Robert Crosnoe; Shannon E.

We use a life course framework to consider how parenting and childlessness influence well-being throughout the adult life course. We place particular emphasis on social contexts and how the impact of parenthood on well-being depends on marital status, gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. We also consider how recent demographic shifts lead to new family arrangements that have implications for parenthood and well-being. These include stepparenting, parenting of grandchildren, and childlessness across the life course.	3	Debra Umberson; Tetyana Pudrovska; Corinne Reczek

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	21	This review focuses on broad themes characterizing marital research in the past decade. In addition to continuing themes, such as a focus on conflict, violence, and impact on physical and mental health outcomes, we also address the impact of the Healthy Marriage Initiative on marital research and recent advances in methodology. We highlight an overarching theme that characterizes much of the literature: the importance of context in understanding marital outcomes and the impact of positive marital transactions and marital strengths. Given the increasing diversity of married couples, the attention given to context over the past decade has been timely and appropriate, providing an increasingly solid foundation for future research.	2	Frank D.

Amato, Paul. 2010. 'Research on Divorce: Continuing Trends and New Developments.' Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:3 650-666.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	68	Research on divorce during the past decade has focused on a range of topics, including the predictors of divorce, associations between divorce and the well-being of children and former spouses, and interventions for divorcing couples. Methodological advances during the past decade include a greater reliance on nationally representative longitudinal samples, genetically informed designs, and statistical models that control for time-invariant sources of unobserved heterogeneity. Emerging perspectives, such as a focus on the number of family transitions rather than on divorce as a single event, are promising. Nevertheless, gaps remain in the research literature, and the review concludes with suggestions for new studies.	1	Paul R. Amato

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	30	This article reviews areas of advancement over the past decade in our understanding of remarriage and stepfamilies and suggests promising new directions for future work. Profound shifts in the demographic context of family life motivate central themes in recent scholarship on remarriage and stepfamilies, including the diversity and complexity of stepfamily structures and processes, the consequences of multiple partnerships for adults and children, and potential selectivity in the characteristics of individuals entering remarried families and stepfamilies. Despite challenges to further progress, I argue that remarriage and stepfamilies offer strategic opportunities to investigate many core concerns of family scholars.	1	Megan M. Sweeney

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	47	Research during the past decade shows that social class or socioeconomic status (SES) is related to satisfaction and stability in romantic unions, the quality of parent-child relationships, and a range of developmental outcomes for adults and children. This review focuses on evidence regarding potential mechanisms proposed to account for these associations. Research findings reported during the past decade demonstrate support for an interactionist model of the relationship between SES and family life, which incorporates assumptions from both the social causation and social selection perspectives. This review concludes with recommendations for future research on SES, family processes, and individual development in terms of important theoretical and methodological issues yet to be addressed.	3	Rand D.

We discuss these developments as the backdrop for emergent work-family research on six central topics: (a) gender, time, and the division of labor in the home; (b) paid work: too much or too little; (c) maternal employment and child outcomes; (d) work-family conflict; (e) work, family, stress, and health; and (f) work-family policy. We conclude with a discussion of trends important for research and suggestions about future directions in the work-family arena.	2	Suzanne M. Bianchi; Melissa A. Milkie

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	7	Research on conflict, power, and violence in families in the 2000s developed a promising focus on the interconnections between types of violence and between the experience of violence and locations in larger structures of power and inequality. I examine research on poly-victimization, typologies of violence, dyadic research, and links between violence and inequalities of gender, race, class, and sexual orientation. Additionally, this review evaluates research on the connections between violence in families and other arenas of family study, including teen pregnancy, marriage formation, cohabitation, and divorce. The review concludes with a discussion of studies showing declines in rates of abuse within families in the 2000s.	1	Kristin L. Anderson

Whereas research in prior decades focused primarily on whether family structure affects child and adult health, contemporary research examines the contextual and processual factors that shape for whom, for which outcomes, and under what conditions families affect mental and physical health. We discuss how family structure, transitions, and processes within families of origin affect children's health over the life course. We then examine the effects of marital status, transitions, and quality for adult health. We point out limitations in current research, discuss implications of recent findings for policy, and highlight theoretical and methodological directions for future research.	2	Deborah Carr; Kristen W.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	6	The past decade brought a remarkable increase in the number and quality of biosocial studies of family processes. The current review summarizes recent advances in biosocial family research by providing key exemplars of emerging research paradigms. Research in the past decade has substantiated the claim in the previous Decade Review (Booth, Carver, \& Granger, 2000) that bidirectional influences between all levels of analysis are paramount. There is an emerging consensus that integrating factors at multiple biological and social levels is highly informative. Because ignoring biological factors often will underestimate mediating or moderating mechanisms, the review provides recommendations for biosocial family research. We also highlight the need for researchers who understand complex family environments to lend their expertise to biosocial studies.	2	Brian M. D'Onofrio; Benjamin B. Lahey

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	5	This decade review centers on 2 disconnects between rhetoric and reality. First, public investments in families continue to grow, yet family policy is still not a term widely used by policymakers or the public. Second, social science studies increased in number and sophistication, with some family sensitive and others policy relevant. Few focus on both, which is what is most needed if research is to inform family policy. In exploring these disconnects, we summarize recent trends in family policies and the influence of research on family policymaking. We suggest a rationale for family policy and illustrate its value using the examples of early childhood, welfare reform, and parent education policies. We conclude with suggested next steps.	2	Karen Bogenschneider; Thomas J. Corbett

Mobilization	2010	1	Rosalie Wahl's appointment to the Minnesota Supreme Court and her subsequent election reveals how emotions make events historical, how they signal symbolic meanings, and how they mobilize social movements. The treatment of political women in the 1970s engendered the emotions that Wahl's appointment and campaign surfaced Relegating women party activists to the role of chore doers rather than decision makers humiliated them. Homemakers felt discarded and downwardly mobile after divorce. Exclusion and discrimination stung women lawyers. Feminism surfaced the powerful emotions of anger, exhilaration, solidarity, and hope that women would break down barriers. By deconstructing the rhetorical arguments of Wahl's speeches, interviewing participants in the campaigns, reading the letters that Minnesotans sent to Wahl, and examining my own emotional reactions, I uncover the emotional dimensions of these events. Understanding what catalyzed intense emotional identifications and what this historical event symbolized to participants facilitates theorizing gender as a social process and understanding why other women first to hold public office or first women candidacies generally do not become historical events.	1	Sally J.

We then use three old and three recent U.S. examples of mobilization focused on food to highlight variations across cases-old and new-in how consumption-based identities are politicized and in how these movements are organized. We recommend using these variations in analytical properties, rather than broadly defined temporal periods, as the starting point for sorting and comparing cases of political consumerism.	2	Jeffrey Haydu; David Kadanoff
Kinchy, Abby. 2010. 'Epistemic Boomerang: Expert Policy Advice as Leverage in the Campaign Against Transgenic Maize in Mexico.' Mobilization. 15:2 179-198.	Mobilization	2010	1	This article introduces the term ``epistemic boomerang'' to describe a distinctive pattern of activism in which activists, frustrated by exclusion from national politics, attempt to mobilize expert advice in support of social goals. Using expertise as leverage can be a desirable option for activists when political authorities favor technocratic decision making. Epistemic boomerang formation is possible when expert organizations encourage citizen participation in agenda setting and spaces are made for encounters between experts and activists. These processes are evident in the contentious politics of genetically engineered maize in Mexico. In this case, maize producers and community activists mobilized to confront an expert advisory group assembled by the tri-national Commission for Environmental Cooperation. As a result, the values and perspectives of many of the protesters were conveyed in the expert report and recommendations. This article examines the political outcomes of this epistemic boomerang and considers its implications for the study of social movements.	1	Abby J. Kinchy
Glass, Pepper. 2010. 'Everyday Routines in Free Spaces: Explaining the Persistence of the Zapatistas in Los Angeles.' Mobilization. 15:2 199-216.	Mobilization	2010	1	While examining the radical potential of `free spaces'' small-scale, grassroots sites for social movements-researchers neglect the daily activities underlying their continued existence. Based on participant observation at Zapatista community centers in Los Angeles, this article argues that everyday routines are important for the persistence of free spaces. Participants spent the majority of their time involved in routines. These were repetitive tasks for maintaining the organization; their focus was practical and immediate, as opposed to theoretical; and the rituals of participatory democracy structured them. At rare times, members reflected on their work, initiating abstract political talk to inspire and unify thernselves in response to tedium from mundane activity or a crisis. Yet, reflection also distracted from applied work and even proliferated organizational schism. This suggests that free spaces retain stability by balancing both routine and reflection.	1	Pepper G.

Mobilization	2010	1	The bureaucratization of many social movements has generated controversy among scholars and activists alike. While there is considerable evidence that formalized social movement organizations (SMOs) tend to be successful, critics maintain that such actors invariably shift resources away from protest, reducing their disruptive potential. The current research seeks to reorient this debate by introducing the concept of threat as an integral,. but overlooked. dimension of protest. Specifically, I hypothesize that the costs associated with collective action will motivate formalized SMOs to leverage the threat of protest to achieve new gains. The empirical case is made using data from a sample of labor unions and their strike activity from 1990-2001, a period of growing acrimony between organized labor and firms that is particularly well suited for analyzing threat. The findings highlight the role of threat in movement challenges and how it interacts with the broader environment within which the SMO is embedded.	1	Andrew W. Martin
Dumais, Susan & Aaryn Ward. 2010. 'Cultural Capital and First-generation College Success.' Poetics. 38:3 245-265.	Poetics	2010	2	Using data from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988 and the Postsecondary Education Transcript Study, we assess the levels of cultural capital possessed by first-generation college students and their non-first-generation peers. Drawing from past quantitative and qualitative studies, we operationalize cultural capital both as high arts participation rewarded by those in power, and as purposeful interactions with key gatekeepers to access information and resources. In doing so, we aim to highlight the importance of both structure and human agency in cultural capital theory. We analyze the effects cultural capital has on enrollment in and persistence through a four-year postsecondary education and on undergraduate grade point averages (GPA), and determine whether cultural capital has a greater effect on non-first-generation students (the reproduction model), first-generation students (the mobility model), or neither group. We find that family cultural capital, cultural classes, and the number of ways parents helped in the college application process are all significant for four-year college enrollment, and parents' help and students' receiving assistance at school with their college applications are significant for graduation. No significant associations are found between the cultural capital variables and GPA. Overall, no support was found for either the reproduction or the mobility models.	2	Susan A. Dumais; Aaryn Ward
Purhonen, Semi, Jukka Gronow & Keijo Rahkonen. 2010. 'Nordic Democracy of Taste? Cultural Omnivorousness in Musical and Literary Taste Preferences in Finland.' Poetics. 38:3 266-298.	Poetics	2010	6	This article explores cultural omnivorousness in music and literature in Finland, one of the so-called Nordic welfare states. Based on nationally representative survey data, literature and music are examined for respondents' likings of different genres. Cultural omnivorousness is first examined by measuring omnivorousness as the sum of the likings of musical and literature genres (''omnivorousness by volume''), and second, by counting only those combinations of likings that cross cultural boundaries (''omnivorousness by composition''). Different taste combinations are constructed and explained by socio-demographic variables motivated by earlier research on omnivorousness and cultural tastes (most notably by Pierre Bourdieu). The results suggest that no matter how omnivorousness is operationalised, socio-demographic factors offer better explanations for literary preferences than for musical ones. In both literature and music, being female and highly educated were the main determinants of omnivorousness. If musical and literary genres are divided into ``highbrow'', ``middlebrow'' and ``lowbrow'', then the omnivore type combining likings from all three categories was the most typical of all combinations in both cultural fields, whereas the hypothetical ``univore snob'' (with likings exclusively limited to the highbrow genres) was practically non-existent. The results also show that those being omnivorous in music are largely omnivorous in literature also.	3	Semi Purhonen; Jukka Gronow; Keijo Rahkonen
Bortolussi, Marisa, Peter Dixon & Paul Sopcak. 2010. 'Gender and Reading.' Poetics. 38:3 299-318.	Poetics	2010	0	In the present research, we examined the effect of protagonist gender on reader evaluations of excerpts from novels. Extant analyses of the role of gender in reading suggest that there should be a gender-match effect in which, for example, women prefer stories with female protagonists. To test this prediction, we created different versions of the excerpts in which a male protagonist was changed to a female protagonist and vice versa. Readers rated the texts on four evaluation items spanning both personal and intersubjective reactions to both the discourse and the story world. Two samples of readers were used: one in Canada and one in Germany. The results indicated that both men and women rated texts higher on the story-world items when they had a male protagonist, inconsistent with the gender-match prediction. There was no difference in this pattern between Canadian and German readers, suggesting that it is common across these cultures. We provide an alternative account based on the fundamental attribution error.	3	Marisa Bortolussi; Peter Dixon; Paul Sopcak
Schramm, Holger & Werner Wirth. 2010. 'Exploring the Paradox of Sad-film Enjoyment: the Role of Multiple Appraisals and Meta-appraisals.' Poetics. 38:3 319-335.	Poetics	2010	6	The paradox of sad-film enjoyment deals with the question of why people are able to feel entertained when watching a sad film that ends unhappily. Previous studies explored the fact that viewers, especially women and those with high empathy readiness, enjoy such films by appraising their sadness positively. This article integrates those meta-appraisals (by developing a state version of Oliver's Sad-Film Scale) with multiple appraisal processes on different situational references (media content reference, production reference, ego reference) that enable an explanation of the paradox of sad-film enjoyment. Against this background, a between-subject experiment involving 125 students was conducted to test the constitution of sadness and enjoyment in three versions of a sad-ending film. The results indicate significant differences between the three versions with respect to sadness, situational references, meta-appraisals, and enjoyment as meta-emotion. A film version that temporarily enables a ``cognitive-switch'' from the protagonist's perspective to the viewer's perspective is more successful in transforming sadness into enjoyment than are film versions that evoke only the protagonist's perspective. This study delivers deeper insights in processes of transforming ``negative'' emotions to ``positive'' emotions during film exposure.	2	Holger Schramm; Werner Wirth
Cheyne, Andrew & Amy Binder. 2010. 'Cosmopolitan Preferences: the Constitutive Role of Place in American Elite Taste for Hip-hop Music 1991-2005.' Poetics. 38:3 336-364.	Poetics	2010	12	Sociology has long identified place as an important theoretical category, and a basic element of social life, but the discipline has largely left implicit the role of place as a structuring element of social perception. We reinterpret two debates in cultural sociology cosmopolitan omnivorism and cultural reception to show how place has been used as a static category, not a productive source of meanings, in these fields. We then introduce how scholars can further develop an analysis of place meanings, and apply this fresh perspective to our empirical study, a discourse analysis of elite music critics' taste for rap music. We find that critics base their judgments of the genre on three place-based criteria, that: (1) rap must be ``emplaced'' to be meaningful, (2) ``ghettoes'' are central to rap's meaningfulness and (3) international scenes are privileged as politically and aesthetically more important than American scenes. These data suggest that the omnivorous taste pattern among American elites follows an intra-genre logic of appropriation that incorporates or rejects cultural objects influenced by the meanings associated with their context of production. We conclude by highlighting the analytic benefit of recognizing place as a constituent element of social perception in cultural sociology.	2	Andrew Cheyne; Amy Binder

Population Research and Policy Review	2010	0	The relationship between migration and child health in individual countries is well known, but the cross-national variation in this relationship is largely untested. Using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 52 medium and low income countries, this study examines the effect of rural-urban migration on infant mortality and whether its effect varies cross-nationally. A secondary objective is to determine whether there is a relationship between the time a child is born in the migration process and infant mortality. Hypotheses are developed on the basis of competing theories on the relationship between migration and health. There are modest, but significant cross-national effects of rural-urban migration on infant mortality, which were better revealed in the presence of family- and child-level variables. The results also show that the unadjusted effects of rural-urban migration are quite substantial, but were largely accounted for by family- and child-level factors including education, socioeconomic status (SES), marital status, birth order, maternal age at child's birth, and inter-births intervals. The results largely point to a selection process, which is further confirmed by results showing that the hazards of infant death increase with length of urban residence. Programs that target increasing maternal education, improving household SES, and lengthening interbirth intervals would therefore greatly benefit child survival in less developed countries.	2	D.

Population Research and Policy Review	2010	0	Data from interviews with staff of government offices, relevant literature and national statistics are used to analyze laws, regulations, rules, policies and operational procedures concerning birth registration in China. The current status of and existing problems with birth registration, as well as the influences of delayed birth registration on children's rights and welfare are examined. Finally, barriers to birth registration in China are explored and strategies to improve the process of birth registration and to protect children's rights are proposed. The main findings are as follows: First, the rate of birth registration in China is low and in rural areas and for marginalized children, it is even lower. Second, the dual birth registration system and interference from the Population and Family Planning department cause serious administrative difficulties. Third, the serious problems surrounding birth registration in China are a result of interactions among the interests of different stakeholders, while most stakeholders are unaware of the dimensions of the problems. Strategies and policies to promote birth registration are discussed.	3	Shuzhuo Li; Yexia Zhang; Marcus W. Feldman
Parr, Nick. 2010. 'Childlessness Among Men in Australia.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:3 319-338.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	1	This paper examines childlessness in later adult life among males in Australia. The data are from 1,610 males aged 45-59 interviewed in 2001 for Wave 1 of the Household Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey, a large-scale, nationwide, longitudinal survey of the household population. Staged logistic regression models are used to identify the early lifecourse antecedents of a man being childless in later life and the mediating effects of work-related variables and duration of union. The results show that the father's and mother's occupations, the level and type of education, and birthplace are important early lifecourse antecedents of whether a man is childless in later life. The lengths of time a man has been in married and cohabiting and his current occupation are found shown to have significant relationships with whether he is childless.	1	Nick Parr
Spence, Naomi & Karin Brewster. 2010. 'Adolescents' Sexual Initiation: the Interaction of Race/ethnicity and Immigrant Status.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:3 339-362.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	2	This paper provides an in-depth examination of the joint effects of race/ethnicity and immigrant status on adolescents' intercourse risk. We employ a sample of 4,535 females and 3,759 males from the National Education Longitudinal Study (NELS 88/94) who were followed for 6 years beginning in the eighth grade. We use discrete-time logistic regression models to estimate the associations of race/ethnicity and immigrant generational status with first intercourse hazard, and to evaluate the statistical interactions between race/ethnicity and immigrant status. Overall, Asian and Hispanic girls had lower and non-Hispanic Black girls had higher estimated risks relative to non-Hispanic White girls. Hispanic boys and White non-Hispanic boys had similar intercourse risks, but Black boys had higher and Asian boys lower relative risks. However, these patterns are contingent on immigrant status. Among girls, the protective effects of Asian or Hispanic identity are found only among second generation youth. Risk profiles for boys are more complex: being a third-plus generation Hispanic is associated with a higher risk while an Asian identity is associated with a lower risk only among first- and second-generation youth. These findings confirm the importance of accounting for the overlap between race/ethnicity and immigrant status in models of adolescent behavior. As the demographic diversity of the US population grows, researchers must include both race/ethnicity and immigrant status in their models of adolescent behavior.	2	Naomi J. Spence; Karin L.

'Toward a Fuller Understanding of Nonresident Father Involvement: an Examination of Child Support, In-kind Support, and Visitation.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:3 363-393.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	5	The majority of studies of nonresident father involvement focus on either child support payments or visitation. However, nearly 60\% of custodial parents receive in-kind (i.e., noncash) support of some form. Using data from a nationally representative sample of children with nonresident fathers (the Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics), we simultaneously investigate via a trivariate probit model the relationships among three aspects of father involvement: child support, in-kind support, and visitation. We find that these dimensions of involvement are positively related and highly intertwined with the strongest positive relationship being between in-kind support and visitation. Additionally, these aspects of involvement have different sets of determinants. Economic characteristics of the resident household are more frequently associated with the receipt of child support, while demographic characteristics of the child, mother, father and resident household are related to all three aspects of nonresident father involvement. Generally speaking, when differences in impacts of determinants vary for lower and higher income resident families, the differences are related to the receipt of child support. Fewer differences are observed with regard to in-kind support receipt or with visitation. Our model also measures how unobserved factors are related to these facets of involvement. Most notable across income groups is that unobserved factors are positively related for child support and in-kind support receipt for higher income resident households. This relationship is insignificant for lower income resident households.	4	Steven Garasky; Susan D. Stewart; Craig Gundersen; Brenda J. Lohman

'Race/ethnicity/nativity Differentials and Changes in Cause-specific Infant Deaths in the Context of Declining Infant Mortality in the Us: 1989-2001.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:3 395-422.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	3	Using data from the national linked birth/infant death cohort files, we examined race/ethnicity/nativity disparities and changes in infant mortality due to the five leading causes of infant death between 1989 and 2001. Our results indicate substantial decreases in infant mortality from three causes (congenital anomalies, sudden infant death syndrome, and respiratory distress syndrome) for which specific perinatal health innovations emerged or were expanded. However, for these three causes, the relative disparities in infant mortality between infants born to U.S.-born black women as compared to infants of U.S.-born white women increased following the introduction (or expansion) of beneficial interventions. Among infants of U.S.-born Mexican American mothers, the findings differed. In the static comparisons, our results show the often-reported similarity in the risk of death of these babies compared to those born to non-Hispanic white mothers. However, when changes over time were modeled, there was an erosion of the relatively favorable survival chances of Mexican American infants. Our models show little change in the relative risk of death for infants of immigrant women. Regarding the other two causes (disorders relating to short gestation and unspecified low birth weight and maternal complications) for which no efficacious innovations occurred, either little change or actual increases in risks were observed. Future studies and health policy efforts should be geared toward further understanding and aggressively working to close infant mortality gaps, especially for infants of U.S.-born black mothers-an effort that will be facilitated by research focused on cause-specific infant mortality.	5	W.

DeRose, Laurie & Alex Ezeh. 2010. 'Decision-making Patterns and Contraceptive Use: Evidence From Uganda.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:3 423-439.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	4	Literature on the effect of decision-making patterns on contraceptive use often does not (1) distinguish between women participating in decisions and controlling them, and (2) account for effects of common decision-making patterns within the community. In Uganda where high fertility persists, both of these factors may be relevant to adoption of contraception. We used data from the 1995/96 Negotiating Reproductive Outcomes (NRO) Study which surveyed 1,750 women in 78 communities located in two districts in Uganda. We assessed the effects of individual and community factors on the adoption of modern contraceptive methods using multilevel logistic regression. We included measures of decision-making patterns at both the individual and community levels that distinguished husband-dominated, joint, and wife-dominated decision-making patterns. Contraceptive use is 29\% more likely in communities where women more commonly have unilateral control over household decisions. This strong effect of normative decision-making patterns within the community is net of individual education and community education, both of which had strong and significant effects. Less traditional gender roles as measured by normative decision-making patterns seem to support more innovative fertility behavior. Community decision-making patterns matter importantly for contraceptive use in this low contraceptive prevalence setting and need to be assessed elsewhere. Further, women's influence is inadequately measured where joint decision-making and wife-dominated decision-making are considered together.	2	Laurie F. DeRose; Alex C. Ezeh
Elcioglu, Emine. 2010. 'Producing Precarity: the Temporary Staffing Agency in the Labor Market.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:2 117-136.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	0	On the basis of fieldwork in a temporary staffing agency (TSA), I argue that while temp agencies may provide transitional mobility for jobseekers, in the long run the TSA systematically exploits and reproduces structural vulnerability in the labor market. The agency creates a core of permanent temporary workers separate from the periphery of surplus workers, such that the former is given priority in job allocation. The staffing agency can use alliances with institutions such as private correctional facilities to control its peripheral workers. At the same time, highly valued core workers also face precarious conditions when they are barred from job mobility and their wages are capped. The agency further reinforces precariousness during the moment of work by extending the agency's surveillance to client sites.	1	Emine Fidan Elcioglu
Wang, Leslie. 2010. 'Importing Western Childhoods Into a Chinese State-run Orphanage.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:2 137-159.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	1	Since the early 1990s the Chinese government has allowed foreign humanitarian non-governmental organizations to aid children residing in official state-run orphanages. As one aspect of a larger research project on child abandonment and forms of orphanage care in contemporary China, this article examines an innovative state-civil society partnership of a Western infant special care unit housed within a large official state-run institution. The ``Tomorrow's Children'' special care unit, funded and managed by middle-class Western volunteers, uses First World medical practices and universalistic ideologies of children and childhood to care for the institution's most severely ill and disabled children. This article utilizes ethnographic methods to discuss conflicts over children's best interests that arise between Western volunteer employers and the local working-class and poor Chinese caregivers who are expected to implement the imported practices. I contend that disagreements over appropriate childcare hinge on cultural and class-based understandings of childhood and differential access to social and financial resources. This research grounds discussions of globalization in a detailed case study by exposing the tensions and negotiations that occur at the local level in processes of transnational exchange.	1	Leslie Wang
Taylor, Judith & Matthew Patterson. 2010. 'Autonomy and Compliance: How Qualitative Sociologists Respond to Institutional Ethical Oversight.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:2 161-183.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	3	Prevailing sociological understandings of institutional ethical review tend to homogenize faculty responses to them, and are predominantly speculative. In this research, we conduct interviews with sociologists from 21 Ph.D.-granting departments across Canada, finding three predominant ``ethics orientations'' among them, with associated cognitive maps and strategic actions. In our analyses, we use these orientations to complicate homogeneous appraisals of social researchers' responses to new bureaucratic requirements, enriching our understanding of how such requirements affect the ways sociologists think about their occupation, approach their research, and mentor successive generations. These ethics orientations suggest the field of sociology is comprised of distinct political cohorts with diverging understandings of ethical review, and by extension, power and intellectual work. For some, ethical review signals a more consultative and therefore better approach to knowledge production, while for others it marks the end of an era of unfettered (and superior) intellectual pursuit in sociology.	2	Judith Taylor; Matthew Patterson

Levesque, Paul & Andrea Guillaume. 2010. 'Teachers, Evolution, and Religion: No Resolution in Sight.' Review of Religious Research. 51:4 349-365.	Review of Religious Research	2010	0	We conducted a survey of 375 female students in K-12 teacher education courses regarding issues of religion and politics. We hypothesized that our respondents would accept the theory of evolution at levels at or above the general female population. We further hypothesized that religious opinions would be strong indicators oft, person's view of evolution, and that many religious students would be able to harmonize their religious faith with the theory of evolution. Our data indicate that female students in teacher education courses did not have a greater acceptance of evolution compared to the general female population as measured by the General Social Survey, and were much less accepting of evolution than women with parallel educational levels. Also, the strongly religious were much more likely to reject evolution. Specifically, strong belief in God, an exclusive view of salvation, and a literal reading of the Bible were the most statistically significant predictors of rejecting the theory of evolution. We propose that future teachers should be assisted by religious leaders and secular educators to recognize that religious faith need not be an obstacle to accepting the scientific theory of evolution.	2	Paul J.

Schwadel, Philip & Kevin Dougherty. 2010. 'Assessing Key Informant Methodology in Congregational Research.' Review of Religious Research. 51:4 366-379.	Review of Religious Research	2010	5	Surveying key informants is a common methodology in congregational research. While practical and cost-effective, there are limitations in the ability of a single informant to speak for an entire organization. This paper explores potential limitations empirically. Using the 1993 American Congregational Giving Study, we compare demographic descriptions provided by pastors to demographic information taken from random samples of members in the same congregations. Significant differences in congregational profiles appear along dimensions of gender, age, race/ethnicity and, most notably), education and income. The amount of discrepancy between pastor and member profiles varies by congregational factors such as denominational affiliation and employment status of pastor We construct diversity measures using both pastor descriptions and surveys from samples of congregation members to demonstrate the impact of data type on conclusions drawn from empirical research. Difficulties notwithstanding, key informant methodology has a place in congregational research with appropriate precautions. Of course, the most complete view of congregations is one that combines perceptions from the pulpit with information directly from the pews.	2	Philip Schwadel; Kevin D. Dougherty
Levin, Jeff & Berton Kaplan. 2010. 'the Sorokin Multidimensional Inventory of Love Experience (smile): Development, Validation, and Religious Determinants.' Review of Religious Research. 51:4 380-401.	Review of Religious Research	2010	1	This paper describes the development and validation of the Sorokin Multidimensional Inventory of Love Experience (SMILE), a 24-item scale based on the writing of sociologist Pitirim Sorokin. The SMILE contains six subscales of four items each, corresponding to what Sorokin termed the religious, ethical, ontological, biological, psychological, and social domains of love. Through confirmatory factor analysis, all factor loadings were found to be strong and statistically significant. A model specifying intercorrelations among all subscales exhibited good overall fit, although biological love was only weakly related to the other factors. Finally, through hierarchical OLS regression, religious measures were found to be significant determinants of scores on five of six subscales. This confirms Sorokin's hypothesis that affirming the experience of love is in part a function of religiousness. The SMILE promises to broaden the scope of social research on love and to promote investigation of this neglected psychosocial construct.	2	Jeff Levin; Berton H. Kaplan

Review of Religious Research	2010	0	This paper explores the relationship between religious behavior, religious belief and intimate partner violence. Survey data were gathered from a sample of undergraduates (N = 626). Our dependent variables were derived from conflict tactics scales and Strauss's Personal and Relationships Profile, measuring violence approval, psychological aggression, and intimate partner violence. Our two substantive independent variables were, first, religiosity as a scale containing questions from the General Social Survey, and second, Christian fundamentalism as a scale used in previously published research. General religiosity, measured as belief in God, strength of religious faith, church attendance, and frequency of prayer; was not associated with violence approval, psychological aggression, or intimate partner violence. However; Christian fundamentalism was positively associated with both violence approval and acts of intimate partner violence, but not psychological aggression.	2	Jerome R.

Review of Religious Research	2010	3	For several decades, U.S.-based studies have indicated significant, positive associations between religiousness and subjective well-being. Despite the importance of this research. samples are limited predominantly to Christians, and we cannot tell whether such relationships extend to other populations. Using data from huge, nationally representative probability samples of Japanese adults, this study reveals that religious devotion and affiliation with certain religions are positively and significantly correlated with life satisfaction and happiness in Japan. Multiple regression analysis shows cross-cultural similarities between subjective religiousness and subjective well-being. The effects of religious affiliation (an objective measure), however, vary In addition, findings show that religious devotion buffers the negative effects of unemployment on life satisfaction and happiness and the effects of low class status on happiness.	1	Michael K.

Lazar, Aryeh. 2010. 'the Relationship Between Spirituality and Religiousness Among Jewish Nurses in Israel.' Review of Religious Research. 51:4 428-439.	Review of Religious Research	2010	0	In order to examine the relationship between spirituality and religiousness, 117 Jewish Israeli hospital nurses responded to a multidimensional measure of humanistic spirituality and indicated their identification with one of the four groups of degree of religious adherence common in Israeli society. Discriminant functional analysis indicated that three dimensions of spirituality Fruits of Spirituality, Transcendent Dimension, and Meaning and Purpose in Life were highly weighted on the significant discriminant function that differentiated between the groups and ordered them according to their degree of religiousness. Three additional spirituality dimensions Mission in Life, Material Values, and Sacredness of Life had slightly lower weights on this function. However; three other dimensions of spirituality Idealism, Altruism and Awareness of the Tragic were found be lowly weighted on the discriminant function. These results indicate that while the former aspects of spirituality are strongly associated with religiousness, the latter aspects are to a large degree independent of it.	1	Aryeh Lazar

Rural Sociology	2010	12	P>We undertake a comparative investigation of how neoliberal restructuring characterizes the third food regime in the three North American countries. By contrasting the experience of the two developed countries of the United States and Canada with that of the developing country of Mexico, we shine some empirical light on the differential impact of neoliberal regulatory restructuring on the division of labor in agriculture within the North American Free Trade Agreement region. In particular, we investigate these countries' agricultural production markets, trade, and food vulnerability-with an emphasis on Mexico-as analytical points for comparing and contrasting their experience with this neoliberal restructuring. We start with a synthesis of food-regime theory and outline the key features of what we call the ``neoliberal food regime.'' We then discuss our case-study countries in terms of food vulnerability and resistance in Mexico, their differential relationships to trade liberalization, and what these trends might mean for the evolution of the neoliberal food regime. We conclude that, while dominant trends are ominous, there is room for an alternative trajectory and consequent reshaping of the emerging regime: sufficient bottom-up social resistance, primarily at the level of the nation-state, may yet produce an alternative trajectory.	2	Gabriela Pechlaner; Gerardo Otero
Bowen, Sarah. 2010. 'Embedding Local Places in Global Spaces: Geographical Indications as a Territorial Development Strategy.' Rural Sociology. 75:2 209-243.	Rural Sociology	2010	8	P>Geographical indications (GIs) are place-based names that convey the geographical origin, as well as the cultural and historical identity, of agricultural products. GIs are unique, in that they provide a means of ensuring that control over production and sales of a product stays within a local area, but at the same time they make use of extralocal markets. Although control over GIs largely rests with local actors, GIs are nested in wider regional, national, and international networks; and the passage from local to extralocal markets introduces new costs and benefits and new relations of power into the supply chain. The degree to which GI protection spurs development and protects local environmental and cultural resources depends on the structure of the GI legislation and on the territorial context in which protection is embedded. Using a commodity-chains approach, I compare two GI production systems, tequila in Mexico and Comte cheese in France, in order to develop a theory of the factors that contribute to more sustainable, equitable GI production systems. I argue that three key differences in the design of the GI schemes help to explain the varying effects of the two cases: (1) the manner in which supply-chain actors define quality, (2) the way that the GI valorizes the terroir of the region, and (3) the strength and cohesion that the collective organizing body exhibits. Moreover, the institutional and political context in which GI supply chains ``touch down'' plays a critical role. Contrary to a conceptualization of GIs as compatible with a purely market-oriented model, my comparison of these two cases indicates that some level of state involvement, in order to level the playing field and empower small farmers, is a necessary, although not sufficient, precondition for successful and sustainable GIs.	1	Sarah Bowen
Howard, Philip & Patricia Allen. 2010. 'Beyond Organic and Fair Trade? an Analysis of Ecolabel Preferences in the United States.' Rural Sociology. 75:2 244-269.	Rural Sociology	2010	11	P>The success of alternative food initiatives indicates increasing interest in changing the way food is produced, processed, and sold. Ecolabels such as organic and Fair Trade have entered the mainstream marketplace, and other voluntary identifiers on products are emerging to address criteria not included in these successful initiatives. Little is known about consumer interests in these criteria, however. To anticipate the direction of food-system changes, as well as assist food producers to meet consumer demands, we conducted a national mail survey to assess preferences for criteria that go ``beyond'' (or could complement) organic and Fair Trade. We utilized a forced-choice paired-comparisons question format to rank five possibilities (humane, local, living wage, small-scale, U.S. grown) that might feasibly be implemented by food producers. Local was the most popular choice, although humane also received a high level of support. Multilevel logistic regression indicated that local was preferred by rural residents, and that humane was preferred by frequent organic consumers and high-income households. Survey respondents also chose product labels more frequently than other potential sources of information about their food. Preferences for local and humane ecolabel criteria should be placed in perspective, as consumers expressed much higher levels of interest in the more individualized concerns of safety and nutrition. The results suggest, however, that consumers are interested in a food system that addresses broader political and ethical values, which has implications for production, marketing, and movement building for sustainable food systems.	2	Philip H.

Rural Sociology. 75:2 270-299.	Rural Sociology	2010	1	P>This study explores Norman Myers's concept of the ``hamburger connection'' as a form of ecologically unequal exchange, where more-developed nations are able to transfer the environmental costs of beef consumption to less-developed nations. I used ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to test whether deforestation in less-developed nations is associated with the vertical flow of beef exports to more-developed nations. An interaction term also examines whether this relationship is more pronounced in Latin American nations, as posited by Myers. The sample includes all nondesert, less-developed nations for which there are available data across all indicators (N = 48). Overall, the results confirm the tested hypotheses. The findings also provide unique contextual support for ecologically unequal exchange theory by demonstrating that unequal trade relationships can operate at the level of a single commodity type.	1	Kelly Austin

Rural Sociology	2010	7	P>Recent years have witnessed an expansion in international investment in large-scale infrastructure projects with the goal of achieving global economic integration. We focus on one such project, the Inter-Oceanic Highway in the ``MAP'' region, a trinational frontier where Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru meet in the southwestern Amazon. We adopt a resilience approach as an integrative framework to understand various types of road-paving impacts. We focus on migration activity as an indicator of retention of collective memory, a concept associated with resilience. We pursue a comparative analysis of the three sides of the MAP frontier as well as subregions within each side. Since road paving may be mediated by other factors, we distinguish among the effects of multiple explanatory factors. Data come from a multinational survey of rural communities. The findings show considerable net migration and turnover, both indicative of eroding collective memory and a lack of demographic resilience to externally induced change in the MAP frontier. The findings indicate variation across the frontier, which road paving helps explain, along with some of the mediating factors. These findings contribute to the literature on the impacts of new infrastructure and integration as well as the study of social-ecological resilience.	5	Stephen G.

Hamilton, Lawrence, Chris Colocousis & Cynthia Duncan. 2010. 'Place Effects on Environmental Views.' Rural Sociology. 75:2 326-347.	Rural Sociology	2010	7	P>How people respond to questions involving the environment depends partly on individual characteristics. Characteristics such as age, gender, education, and ideology constitute the well-studied ``social bases of environmental concern,'' which have been explained in terms of cohort effects or of cognitive and cultural factors related to social position. It seems likely that people's environmental views depend not only on personal characteristics but also on their social and physical environments. This hypothesis has been more difficult to test, however. Using data from surveys in 19 rural U.S. counties, we apply mixed-effects modeling to investigate simple place effects with respect to locally focused environmental views. We find evidence for two kinds of place effects. Net of individual characteristics, specific place characteristics have the expected effect on related environmental views. Local changes are related to attitudes about regulation and growth. For example, respondents more often perceive rapid development as a problem, and favor environmental rules that restrict development, in rural counties with growing populations. Moreover, they favor conserving resources for the future rather than using them now to create jobs in counties that have low unemployment. After we controlled for county growth, unemployment and jobs in resource-based industries, and individual social-position and ideological factors, there remains significant place-to-place variation in mean levels of environmental concern. Even with both kinds of place effects in the models, the individual-level predictors of environmental concern follow patterns expected from previous research. Concern increases with education among Democrats, whereas among Republicans, the relationship is attenuated or reversed. The interaction marks reframing of environmental questions as political wedge issues, through nominally scientific counterarguments aimed at educated, ideologically receptive audiences.	3	Lawrence C.

Social Compass	2010	4	The author argues that religious pluralism is the normal state of affairs. Religion itself is multi-dimensional, and the several dimensions of religious and spiritual experience can be combined in myriad ways across individual lives. Preliminary findings from new research are presented, detailing modes of spiritual discourse that include mystery, majesty, meaning, moral compassion, and social connection. These dimensions find expression across multiple social institutions. In addition, religion is multi-traditional and organized by plural producers of the goods and services and events that embody and transform religious tradition. Finally, it is argued that religious pluralism must be studied in terms of the structures of power and privilege that allow some religious ideas to be given free voice, but limit the practice of other religious rituals or the gathering of dissident religious communities.	1	Nancy T.

Social Compass	2010	2	In the first part of this article, the author tries to clarify a set of interconnected concepts-religious plurality (diversity), pluralization, and pluralism. As a descriptive concept for sociological theorizing, social pluralism is further differentiated into legal, civic and cultural arrangements. Modern pluralization may have started accidentally in the United States of America, but it has become a general trend in the world. In the second part, the author argues that the predominant type of Church-State relationship in the world today is neither monopoly nor pluralism, but oligopoly. More importantly, the theoretical propositions based on the studies of monopoly-pluralism are not applicable without substantial modification to explain oligopoly dynamics. The China case shows that in oligopoly, increased religious regulation leads not necessarily to religious decline, but to triple religious markets: the red market (legal), black market (illegal) and grey market (both legal and illegal or neither legal nor illegal).	1	Fenggang Yang

The third is the recent settlement in Spain of a large immigrant population, which is causing fractures in a previously homogenous religious community. The first two follow the lines of religious modernization seen in other European countries. The third, however, is more inherent to the contemporary era of globalization.	1	Alfonso Perez-Agote
Diez, Francisco. 2010. 'the Visibilization of Religious Minorities in Spain.' Social Compass. 57:2 235-252.	Social Compass	2010	1	The author presents the increasing visibilization of the multitude of religious possibilities that are currently on offer in Spain and that form such a clear counterpoint to what for centuries was the one and only religion in this country: Catholicism. He proposes a presentation divided into three parts, which analyse the following visibilization factors: 1) The heritage factor, as seen in the multiplication of visible alternatives of all kinds that minority religions put forward; 2) The legal factor, which in Spain divides religious groups into five categories, characterized by differences, inequalities and privileges; 3) The numerical factor, a problematic aspect that relates to the difficulties of religious quantification in Spain, reflective of the complexity of religious identity in this country and the struggle to obtain reliable statistical data.	1	Francisco Diez
Canton, Manuela. 2010. 'Gypsy Pentecostalism, Ethnopolitical Uses and Construction of Belonging in the South of Spain.' Social Compass. 57:2 253-267.	Social Compass	2010	1	The Gypsy Evangelical movement started in the west of France where, in the mid twentieth century, the first conversions took place. Back home, the converted started preaching among their people, spreading the religious movement all the way to western Andalusia. Half a century later, we can hardly call this a ``new'' movement, but we can certainly say that Gypsy Pentecostalism has become one of the most original organizational experiences developed by Spanish gypsies. The process of constructing this new sense of ethnic and religious belonging has been marked by the double suspicion that hangs over Evangelical Gypsies: first, as part of a stigmatized ethnic minority and, second, as members of a religious ``sect''. However, this has also helped to strengthen the process of ethnogenesis and cultural reinvention that is redrawing the image of gypsies from the angle of Evangelism. It has also brought about the strategic and intentional mobilization of ethnicity-the search for recognition and political activity aimed at obtaining public resources to finance extensive social development.	1	Manuela Canton
Nunez, Francesc. 2010. 'Leaving the Institution. Secularized Priests.' Social Compass. 57:2 268-284.	Social Compass	2010	1	Toward the end of the last century, particularly during the late 1960s and throughout the 1970s, hundreds of Catholic priests distanced themselves from the Church or decided to leave the ecclesiastical institution. This fact, unusual at that time, is the focal point of the present article, which is the result of an extensive investigation into the renunciation of the priesthood by a significant number of priests in the Barcelona diocese. The author addresses the question why such deeply committed members of an institution, as are the priests of the Catholic Church, decided to leave the institution at that moment. The author discusses some aspects of the social context in which this process took place and offers some explanations for these significant departures.	1	Francesc Nunez

Cunningham, David, Colleen Nugent & Caitlin Slodden. 2010. 'the Durability of Collective Memory: Reconciling the ``greensboro Massacre''.' Social Forces. 88:4 1517-1542.	Social Forces	2010	2	While the general dynamics governing collective memory processes are well developed theoretically, our tool kit for systematically assessing how collective memory changes over time remains limited. Here, we focus on a particular tragic event the killing of five participants in an anti-KKK march in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Nov. 3, 1979 to assess continuity and change across accounts presented as part of a 1980 federally-sponsored investigation and a 2005 truth and reconciliation commission. Specifically, we employ a block modeling methodology to describe the structure of narrative themes shared across multiple accounts in each time period. We then analyze the sources of temporal variation in these narratives, and show how shifts in the range of actors participating in the 1980 and 2005 initiatives, as well as the institutional contexts within which accounts were offered, shaped how themes were strategically deployed to increase the resonance of specific positions. We find that, in the Greensboro case, the contours of these demographic and institutional dimensions resulted in a decrease in the polarization of competing narratives and an increased emphasis on key themes that contested elite ``institutional'' accounts.	3	David Cunningham; Colleen Nugent; Caitlin Slodden
Simon, Robin & Kathryn Lively. 2010. 'Sex, Anger and Depression.' Social Forces. 88:4 1543-1568.	Social Forces	2010	5	A social problem that has preoccupied sociologists of gender and mental health is the higher rate of depression found among women. Although a number of hypotheses about this health disparity between men and women have been advanced, none consider the importance of subjectively experienced anger. Drawing on theoretical and empirical insights from the sociology of emotion, we hypothesize that: (1. intense and persistent anger are associated with more symptoms of depression, and (2. sex differences in the intensity and persistence of anger are involved in the sex difference in depressed affect. Analyses of data from the 1996 GSS Emotions Module provide support for these two hypotheses and strongly suggest that women's intense and persistent anger play a pivotal role in their high rate of depression. We discuss the extent to which sex differences in these emotions are a function of social factors, biological factors, or a complex interaction between them. We also comment on the implications of our findings for future theory and research on gender, emotion and mental health.	2	Robin W. Simon; Kathryn Lively
Peifer, Jared. 2010. 'the Economics and Sociology of Religious Giving: Instrumental Rationality or Communal Bonding?.' Social Forces. 88:4 1569-1594.	Social Forces	2010	3	Religious individuals commonly make sizable monetary sacrifices by contributing to their congregations. This social action resides in the overlap of religious and economic realms of behavior, creating a certain tension. Following a Weberian approach to social inquiry, I treat religious giving as social action whereby individuals direct their value-rational and instrumental-rational behavior towards others. Using data from the American Congregational Giving Survey and the Social Capital Community Benchmark Survey, I test hypotheses derived from a rational choice perspective, the sense of solidarity one feels, and from the religious meaning of the giver. Rational choice hypotheses produce mixed results, the solidarity impact is confirmed, and high levels of religiosity have a strong impact on giving.	1	Jared L. Peifer
Vaisey, Stephen & Omar Lizardo. 2010. 'Can Cultural Worldviews Influence Network Composition?.' Social Forces. 88:4 1595-1618.	Social Forces	2010	22	Most sociological research assumes that social network composition shapes individual beliefs. Network theory and research has not adequately considered that internalized cultural worldviews might affect network composition. Drawing on a synthetic, dual-process theory of culture and two waves of nationally-representative panel data, this article shows that worldviews are strong predictors of changes in network composition among U.S. youth. These effects arc robust to the influence of other structural factors, including prior network composition and behavioral homophily. By contrast, there is little evidence that networks play a strong proximate role in shaping worldviews. This suggests that internalized cultural dispositions play an important role in shaping the interpersonal environment and that the dynamic link between culture and social structure needs to be reconsidered.	2	Stephen Vaisey; Omar Lizardo
Zhou, Min. 2010. 'Multidimensionality and Gravity in Global Trade, 1950-2000.' Social Forces. 88:4 1619-1643.	Social Forces	2010	7	The expansion of global trade in the post-war period is subject to various interpretations. Some stress the trade-promoting role of the novel features in the world economy; some insist on the role of traditional factors, such as geographic distance, political difference and cultural dissimilarity, in continuously depressing trade flows; others even argue that the importance of these traditional factors has been on the rise. To adjudicate the divergence, this article applies the gravity model to a large data set on global bilateral trade from 1950 through 2000. Although the global institutional factor does promote bilateral trade and global economic activity indeed becomes more trade-generating, the trade-depressing effects of geographic distance, political difference and cultural dissimilarity remain strong. Moreover, geographic and cultural proximity actually generates greater gravity over time that draws countries together, which may trigger fragmentation in global trade along geo-cultural lines.	1	Min Zhou
Chiu, Ming. 2010. 'Effects of Inequality, Family and School on Mathematics Achievement: Country and Student Differences.' Social Forces. 88:4 1645-1676.	Social Forces	2010	6	Inequality, family and school characteristics were linked to student achievement as shown by multi-level analyses of 107,975 15 year olds' mathematics tests and questionnaires in 41 countries. Equal distribution of country and school resources were linked to higher mathematics scores. Students scored higher in families or schools with more resources (SES, native born, two parents, more educational materials, higher SES schoolmates, female schoolmates, class time, educated teachers) or beneficial intangible processes (communication, discipline, teacher-student relationships). Students living with grandparents or siblings (especially older ones) scored lower. Physical family resource variables showed similar results across countries, supporting the social reproduction hypothesis for physical resources. In richer countries, intangible processes had stronger links with mathematics achievement, suggesting that greater availability of public physical resources raises the value of complementary intangible processes, which can help explain the Heyneman-Loxley effect of stronger family effects in richer countries.	1	Ming Ming Chiu
Junisbai, Azamat. 2010. 'Understanding Economic Justice Attitudes in Two Countries: Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.' Social Forces. 88:4 1677-1702.	Social Forces	2010	2	Analyzing data from the 2007 Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan Inequality Survey, I identify and compare the determinants of economic justice attitudes in two formerly similar majority-Muslim nations that are now distinguished almost exclusively by their dissimilar economic circumstances following the collapse of the Soviet Union, In Kazakhstan, where the economy is growing rapidly, the important factors predicting economic egalitarianism are connected to people's perceived ability to do well in the future. In contrast, in Kyrgyzstan, which has stagnated in the post-Soviet era, people's immediate economic vulnerability predicts egalitarianism, while their economic prospects are irrelevant. Finally, the effect of several factors on support for egalitarianism appears impervious to the prevailing economic winds: religious orthodoxy, the urban vs. rural divide, and membership in a historically privileged ethnic group. These patterns reflect both the commonalities in the two countries' histories, demography, and religion and their divergent economic trajectories since the collapse of the USSR.	1	Azamat K. Junisbai
Stack, Steven, Amy Adamczyk & Liqun Cao. 2010. 'Survivalism and Public Opinion on Criminality: a Cross-national Analysis of Prostitution.' Social Forces. 88:4 1703-1726.	Social Forces	2010	7	Explanations of variability in public opinion on crime have drawn disproportionately from the literature on specific symbolic orientations including religious fundamentalism and racial prejudice. In contrast, this article hypothesizes that public opinion is linked to the strength of a general cultural axis of nations: survivalism vs. self-expressionism. Data are from the fourth wave of the World Values Survey. Hierarchical modeling techniques are used to sort out the bi-level effects of survivalist culture on the approval of prostitution. Controlling for all other predictors, the personal survivalism index was the most powerful predictor of prostitution acceptability, followed by the country-level survivalism index. Unlike previous investigations, which relied on specific symbolic orientations, the present results suggest that attitudes about criminality are linked to a generalized cultural axis.	3	Steven Stack; Amy Adamczyk; Liqun Cao

Social Forces	2010	1	Using growth curve modeling techniques, this research investigates whether military spending improved or worsened the economic well-being of citizens within the American states during the post-Vietnam War period. We empirically test the military Keynesianism claim that military spending improves the economic conditions of citizens through its use by politicians as a countercyclical tool to reduce the negative effects of economic downturns. However, due to deindustrialization and the emergence of the ``new military,'' there are reasons to believe that military spending will not effectively improve economic well-being during the post-Vietnam War era. Using longitudinal data we find that states with high levels of military spending are better equipped to stave off the deleterious effects of economic recession than are states with lower levels of military spending.	2	Casey Borch; Michael Wallace
Clark, Shelley & Catherine Kenney. 2010. 'Is the United States Experiencing a ``matrilineal Tilt?'': Gender, Family Structures and Financial Transfers to Adult Children.' Social Forces. 88:4 1753-1776.	Social Forces	2010	3	Furstenberg et al. (1995) suggested that one unanticipated consequence of current high levels of divorce might be a ``matrilineal tilt'' in intergenerational wealth flows. This research uses six waves of the Health and Retirement Survey (1992 to 2002) to investigate this possibility with respect to financial transfers from parents to their adult children. We find that although divorced single fathers continue to make transfers to their adult biological children, remarriage substantially reduces fathers' transfers while it increases mothers' transfers to their biological children. Our findings are consistent with both socio-evolutionary and exchange theories predicting women's vs. men's investments in biological vs. stepchildren.	2	Shelley Clark; Catherine Kenney

This study extends previous research by estimating the influence of body mass on occupational attainment over three decades of the career using data from the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. In a series of covariance structure analyses, we considered three mechanisms that may alter the career trajectories of heavy individuals: (1. employment-based discrimination, (2. educational attainment, and (3. marriage market processes. Unlike previous studies, we found limited evidence that employment-based discrimination impaired the career trajectories of either men or women. Instead, we found that heavy women received less post-secondary schooling than their thinner peers, which in turn adversely affected their occupational standing at each point in their careers.	3	Christy M.

Social Forces	2010	4	We assess the intergenerational educational mobility of recent cohorts of high school graduates to consider whether Hispanics' lagging post-secondary attainment reflects a temporary lull due to immigration of low education parents or a more enduring pattern of unequal transmission of social status relative to whites. Using data from three national longitudinal studies, a recent longitudinal study of Texas high school seniors and a sample of students attending elite institutions, we track post-secondary enrollment and degree attainment patterns at institutions of-differing selectivity. We find that group differences in parental education and nativity only partly explain the Hispanic-white gap in college enrollment, and not evenly over time. Both foreign- and native-born college-educated Hispanic parents are handicapped in their abilities to transmit their educational advantages to their children compared with white parents. We conclude that both changing population composition and unequal ability to confer status advantages to offspring are responsible for the growing Hispanic-white degree attainment gap.	3	Sigal Alon; Thurston Domina; Marta Tienda

Social Forces	2010	2	During the 1980s and 1990s, industrial restructuring led to a marked increase in wage inequality. Women, however, were nor as negatively affected by declining, manufacturing employment because their pay was relatively low within the industry, and their already high representation in the service sector provided access to newly created opportunities. However, black and white women did not fare equally and the black-white wage gap more than doubled. As both black and white women increased their representation as professionals and managers, black women became more likely to earn low wages within these occupations. Black degree holders also lost ground as they were unable to keep pace with the remarkable gains made by white women degree holders. The growth in black-white wage inequality, then, was not due to black women's relegation to ``bad jobs.'' Instead, as women increased their share of ``good jobs,'' white women disproportionately benefitted.	1	Raine Dozier
Stecklov, Guy & Joshua Goldstein. 2010. 'Societal Responses to Endemic Terror: Evidence From Driving Behavior in Israel.' Social Forces. 88:4 1859-1884.	Social Forces	2010	1	In this article, using data on traffic volume and fatal accident rates in Israel from 2001 to 2004 a period spanning much of the Second Intifada-we examine the population-level responses to endemic terror to uncover whether societies become habituated so that the response weakens Following repeated attacks or whether they become increasingly sensitized so subsequent attacks have a greater impact. Our analysis, using distributed-lag time series models, supports earlier findings while highlighting the persistence of the response to terror attacks even several years into the violence. There arc, however, signs that the reaction to terror has accelerated. This shift, which is not naturally seen as evidence for either habituation or sensitization, is suggestive of social learning of norms over time.	2	Guy Stecklov; Joshua R. Goldstein

Nixon, Jennifer & Cathy Humphreys. 2010. 'Marshalling the Evidence: Using Intersectionality in the Domestic Violence Frame.' Social Politics. 17:2 137-158.	Social Politics	2010	4	The movement against domestic violence has achieved a number of successes in challenging violence between intimate or formerly intimate partners and in providing services for survivors of domestic abuse. It has, in effect, mainstreamed the message that domestic violence is common and dangerous to women of all backgrounds. In this article, we look closely at statistical evidence around prevalence, gender, ethnicity, and poverty to investigate this claim. We argue that the framing of domestic violence could be advanced through the use of a social movement frame that draws on issues of intersectionality.	2	Jennifer Nixon; Cathy Humphreys

Social Politics	2010	0	Integrating insights from a problem representation approach and a feminist bargaining framework, I explore the ``lived effects'' of Canada's anti-wife abuse policy frameworks. The policy frameworks are premised on protection, which requires removal from danger. In effect, anti-violence policy problematizes the behavior of women, constructing women's resistance to abuse as only exit, falsely classifying the women who leave as ``resistors'' and those who stay as either ``helpless victims'' or ``willing participants''. Where the ``helpless victims'' are constructed as policy problems, the other women are defined away from the policy frameworks, offered no protection from the state. The analysis reveals that anti-violence policy, far from protecting women, actually increases their vulnerability to abuse.	1	Stephanie Paterson

Social Politics	2010	0	Two social changes that have taken place within the Israel Defense Forces-feminism and religiosity-are marching toward a confrontation. It is a clash between two groups that have significantly increased their presence in the combat units since the 1990s. Central to this dispute is the rabbis' demand that men and women be kept separate in combat units, a demand that may reset barriers to the equal integration of women into these units. Using an interpretative methodology, this paper argues that this clash is a multilayered conflict, which is nurtured by institutional interests, cultural symbols, and hidden agendas. It is an asymmetric conflict in which religious groups have a definite advantage.	1	Yagil Levy
Jeffreys, Sheila. 2010. '``brothels Without Walls'': the Escort Sector as a Problem for the Legalization of Prostitution.' Social Politics. 17:2 210-234.	Social Politics	2010	1	This article examines a developing trend in the prostitution industry in the western world, the boom in escort prostitution. Escort prostitution, operating through mobile phones and the Internet, is supplanting the brothel as the major form in which prostituted women are delivered to male buyers. Policy-makers who promote the legalization of the prostitution industry have argued that this policy will make prostituted women and girls safer and combat organized crime. These assumptions are based upon the idea that prostitution will take place in brothels which can institute health and safety codes, and enable easy identification of the illegal brothel industry which can be closed down. Escort prostitution provides particular challenges to the regulation of prostitution because there is no way in which it can be controlled or made ``safe.'' Alongside the other harms associated with prostitution which are exacerbated in legalized regimes, this development provides a significant reason why the policy of legalization is doomed to fail in achieving its objectives. The problems associated with the escort boom will be examined in relation to the state of Queensland in Australia, and the Netherlands, jurisdictions in which the prostitution industry has been legalized.	1	Sheila Jeffreys

Social Politics	2010	2	Is gender inequality in unpaid work within households implicated in falling fertility rates? This paper investigates whether the likelihood couples with one child will have more children is affected by: (i) the amount of household labor they each perform or (ii) the way they divide household labor between themselves. Drawing a sample of partnered couples with one child (n = 573) from the longitudinal Household, Income and Labor Dynamics in Australia survey, we conduct multivariate regression analysis and find the more housework that Australian women do, the less likely they are to have more children. Neither fathers' time allocation to housework, nor relative shares of housework, were found to have an effect on subsequent fertility. Thus, mothers' own domestic workloads negatively impacted upon fertility, but shares of housework did not.	2	Lyn Craig; Peter Siminski
Molm, Linda. 2010. 'the Structure of Reciprocity.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 73:2 119-131.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	18	Reciprocity is one of the defining features of social exchange and social life, yet exchange theorists have tended to take it for granted. Drawing on work from a decade-long theoretical research program. I argue that reciprocity is structured and variable across different forms of exchange, that these variations in the structure of reciprocity have profound effects on the emergence of integrative bonds of trust and solidarity, and that these effects are explained and mediated by a set of risk- and conflict-based processes. I discuss the consequences of this work for organizational theories of embeddedness and the production of social capital through network ties. Finally, I ask how the structure of networks and the structure of reciprocity are related to one another, and explore possible implications of the structure of reciprocity for exchange theorists assumptions about actor motivations.	1	Linda D.

Gibson, David. 2010. 'Marking the Turn: Obligation, Engagement, and Alienation in Group Discussions.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 73:2 132-151.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	6	In group conversations, not speaking is the state of affairs experienced by most people most of the time; I refer to this as ``conversational latency.'' Hypothesizing that conversational latency affects one's discursive options, I analyze the association between latency (operationalized as the number of turns that elapsed since the current speaker last spoke) and turn-initial words (e.g., but, oh) in twenty-nine experimental task groups, taking turn-initial words as indicators of the type of content a speaker proposes to produce. The findings suggest a model of group conversation in which conversational obligations weigh heaviest on the shoulders of the most recent contributors; those who contributed somewhat less recently remain engaged but have more latitude to take discordant positions; and those who have been quiet for longer periods are susceptible to ``alienation from topic,'' as a result of which re-entry is often accompanied by an attempt to change the topic.	1	David A.

Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	0	In our everyday interactions as they unfold in real time, how do we do including? This article examines a specific set of interactional moments when the potential to be included (or not) recurs: when a newcomer arrives to some social scene where two or more already-present persons are actively engaged in some activity and that newcomer displays interest in joining into their activity. I show how arriving newcomers bodily display that they want to join into the pre-present party's interaction, and I analyze a key utterance-based practice that pre-present speakers use to include newcomers into their interaction the-practice of previous activity formulating. Through this practice, speakers summarize the activities or conversational topics in which they were engaged before establishing copresence with arrivers, thereby making way and making sense for them so they can join into their interaction. By showing that participants treat pre-present speakers offers of formulations as preferred over arrivers' requests for formulations, I demonstrate that how speakers come to deliver these formulations implicates social solidarity between pre-present and arriving parties.	1	Danielle Pillet-Shore

Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	4	In this study, we investigate the relationship between uncertainty and trust in exogenous shifts in modes of social exchange (i.e., those that are not initiated by the individuals in a given exchange system). We explore how transitions from a high uncertainty environment (reciprocal exchange) to lower-uncertainty environments (nonbinding or binding negotiated exchange) affect the level of trust among exchange partners. Our results show that if cooperation rates are high before and after a change in mode of exchange, trust declines when the uncertainty created by the mode of exchange decreases. Furthermore, we find that trust depends on both the amount of uncertainty inherent in the form of the exchange and the level of cooperation before and after the transition.	3	Coye Cheshire; Alexandra Gerbasi; Karen S.

Friedkin, Noah. 2010. 'the Attitude-behavior Linkage in Behavioral Cascades.' Social Psychology Quarterly. 73:2 196-213.	Social Psychology Quarterly	2010	6	The assumption that individual behavior has an antecedent evaluative foundation is an important component of theories in sociology, psychology, political science, and economics. In its simplest form, the antecedent evaluation is a positive or negative attitude toward an object that may affect an individual's object-related behavior. This attitude may be influenced by the attitudes of other persons. The occurrence of such endogenous interpersonal influences, in which persons' attitudes are affected by other persons attitudes, is among the basic postulates of social psychology. The present article advances work on the attitude-behavior linkage in behavioral cascades by jointly considering two theories: the theory of reasoned-planned action, which emphasizes the deliberative foundations of individuals' object-related behaviors, and social influence network theory, which emphasizes the group dynamics involved in the formation of individuals' attitudes.	1	Noah E.

Wacquant, Loic. 2010. 'Crafting the Neoliberal State: Workfare, Prisonfare, and Social Insecurity.' Sociological Forum. 25:2 197-220.	Sociological Forum	2010	17	In Punishing the Poor, I show that the ascent of the penal state in the United States and other advanced societies over the past quarter-century is a response to rising social insecurity, not criminal insecurity; that changes in welfare and justice policies are interlinked, as restrictive ``workfare'' and expansive ``prisonfare'' are coupled into a single organizational contraption to discipline the precarious fractions of the postindustrial working class; and that a diligent carceral system is not a deviation from, but a constituent component of, the neoliberal Leviathan. In this article, I draw out the theoretical implications of this diagnosis of the emerging government of social insecurity. I deploy Bourdieu's concept of ``bureaucratic field'' to revise Piven and Cloward's classic thesis on the regulation of poverty via public assistance, and contrast the model of penalization as technique for the management of urban marginality to Michel Foucault's vision of the ``disciplinary society,'' David Garland's account of the ``culture of control,'' and David Harvey's characterization of neoliberal politics. Against the thin economic conception of neoliberalism as market rule, I propose a thick sociological specification entailing supervisory workfare, a proactive penal state, and the cultural trope of ``individual responsibility.'' This suggests that we must theorize the prison not as a technical implement for law enforcement, but as a core political capacity whose selective and aggressive deployment in the lower regions of social space violates the ideals of democratic citizenship.	1	Loic Wacquant

Absent from many discussions of the merits of multicultural college settings is specification of the interactional processes and cultural transformations that presumably lie at the heart of diversity payoffs. This project focuses on students from four minority groups, three of whom are second-generation immigrants, in a racially diverse university, combining focus groups and in-depth interviews. First, we analyze how the social mixing practices of students congeal into ethnoracial boundaries on campus. We find that two images of multiculturalism (''fragmented pluralism'' and ``interactive pluralism'') play out simultaneously on this campus. Second, we examine the pathways leading to more insular ethnoracial mixing and toward more heterogeneous social mixing, as well as explore the cultural meanings of these practices in student narratives. We also compare the influence of campus context, student agency, and internal and external group pressures on varying degrees of student satisfaction with their achieved social worlds.	2	Sherri Grasmuck; Jennifer Kim

Sociological Forum	2010	0	Race too often is used as the explanatory variable for understanding immigration exclusion, marginalizing the significance of race making, ethnic differentiation, and gender construction in particular. This article explores these processes by examining exclusionary policies implemented against Chinese and Japanese immigrants from the mid-1870s to 1924, the year the National Origins Act was passed. Politicians, intellectuals, and moral reformers used a gendered logic-the construction of idealized gender norms, roles, and sexual propriety and the attachment of these meanings to male and female bodies-to distinguish Japanese immigrants from the Chinese immigrants they followed, allowing for ethnic differentiation and dissimilar policies. The convergence toward exclusion rested on a racialized logic-the construction and attachment of inferior status and meanings to immigrant groups through discourse, formal and informal categorization, or social closure-which claimed that the Japanese were unassimilable and racially undesirable like the Chinese. Exclusionists focused on the immigrant women, decrying their sexual and gender impropriety as evidence of the groups' threats to the sanctity of white families, which imperiled the nation. Gender and race both mattered in these logics and their meanings were constructed as their salience interconnected.	1	Catherine Lee

The article focuses on the sequential unfolding of micro interactions and emotional dynamics that preceded the atrocity. Micro interactions constitute situational turning points toward, or away from, atrocities. Even if there are preplanned plots or macro-structural background conditions that lead particular persons to be motivated to commit violence, a micro-situational, emotional momentum is needed for atrocities to occur. The article brings together the analysis of video material of violent situations with Ekman's research tools for emotional cues and Collins's micro-sociological theory of violence.	1	Stefan Klusemann
Campbell, Bradley. 2010. 'Contradictory Behavior During Genocides.' Sociological Forum. 25:2 296-314.	Sociological Forum	2010	6	In all large-scale genocides, rescuing occurs alongside killing. Some members of the aggressors' ethnic group even risk their own lives to save members of the targeted group. Killing and rescuing occur closely together, and even the same persons may engage in both behaviors-killing on one occasion and rescuing on another. This article examines such cases-where the same individuals kill and rescue-and discusses their relevance to the explanation of genocide. Both collectivistic and individualistic theories of killing and rescuing-which explain these behaviors with the properties of groups or persons-are inadequate in accounting for those who do both. Using Donald Black's (1995, 2000)strategy of pure sociology and my theory of genocide (Campbell, 2009), I offer an explanation of contradictory behavior by individuals during genocide. The behaviors themselves occur in different structures-killing where there is social distance and rescuing where there is social closeness. Individuals who exhibit contradictory behavior thus kill those who are distant and save those who are close. One feature of this analysis is its demonstration of the explanatory power of pure sociology, which is uniquely capable of explaining extreme variations in individual behavior.	1	Bradley Campbell
Latimer, Melissa & Rachael Woldoff. 2010. 'Good Country Living? Exploring Four Housing Outcomes Among Poor Appalachians.' Sociological Forum. 25:2 315-334.	Sociological Forum	2010	1	In the wake of welfare reform, many poor people have exhausted their benefits and must now live with less government support. While all of these former welfare recipients are struggling, some are experiencing housing problems that are quite severe. This article uses survey data on former welfare recipients who have used up the maximum time limits for receiving welfare to better understand three core explanations for rural housing problems among the poor: community, individual, and family factors. We estimate models to weigh the relative effects of these factors on the likelihood of experiencing several housing outcomes, finding that rural location is the most consistent predictor of housing outcomes, predicting home ownership, and whether families reside in low-quality housing. We also find that individual and family factors affect the type of housing one has. We conclude that housing policies must be tailored to improve specific housing outcomes.	2	Melissa Latimer; Rachael A. Woldoff
McDonald, Steve & Christine Mair. 2010. 'Social Capital Across the Life Course: Age and Gendered Patterns of Network Resources.' Sociological Forum. 25:2 335-359.	Sociological Forum	2010	6	Despite increasing research interest in network dynamics and cumulative advantage/disadvantage processes, little remains known about how social capital varies across the life course. While some researchers suggest that social capital increases with age and others argue the opposite, this study tests these contradictory assertions by analyzing multiple indicators of social capital from a nationally representative data set on working-age U.S. respondents. The findings reveal evidence of both social capital accumulation and decline. Social resources from occupational contacts tend to increase with age, but eventually level off among older respondents. Changes in voluntary memberships follow a similar pattern. However, daily social interaction is negatively associated with age. Overall, the results suggest that social capital embedded in occupational networks tends to accumulate across the career, even in the face of a general decline in sociability. The study also uncovers gender differences in these social capital trajectories that are linked to the distinct life experiences of men and women.	2	Steve McDonald; Christine A. Mair
Hansen, Laura & Siamak Movahedi. 2010. 'Wall Street Scandals: the Myth of Individual Greed.' Sociological Forum. 25:2 367-374.	Sociological Forum	2010	3	There is rarely an introductory text in sociology that does not begin with C. Wright Mills's (1967)distinction between personal troubles and structural or public issues. To lack sociological imagination is to confuse between these two levels of analysis in trying to explain public issues in terms of personal troubles, or history in terms of the individual's biography. ``Troubles occur within the character of the individual and within the range of his immediate relations with others; Issues have to do with matters that transcend these local environments of the individual and the range of his inner life'' (Mills, 1967:8). Issues are generated in response to the dynamics of the social system and unfold within the larger structural and historical contexts where the character of the individual takes shape. Yet, the most popular explanation of the contemporary financial crisis with its disastrous social and economic consequences is personal greed. It is the greedy investment bankers, corrupt politicians, and unscrupulous lobbyists who are to take the brunt of the current economic meltdown in the United States. A few bad apples on Wall Street have created havoc on Main Street. Here, one may argue that greed that-if not kept in check-which seems to afflict almost everyone, transcending social class and status boundaries, may be a public issue-a structural problem-rather than a problem within the character of the individual. Not to be greedy within the contemporary social and economic system may be considered pathological, an instance of personal trouble.	2	Laura L. Hansen; Siamak Movahedi
Carpenter, Laura. 2010. 'Gendered Sexuality Over the Life Course: a Conceptual Framework.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:2 155-177.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	0	Despite increasing interest in gendered sexuality over the life course, a comprehensive conceptual model, applicable to all aspects of sexual life and incorporating recent developments in life course sociology, feminist theory, and sexuality studies, has yet to be elaborated. The model presented here posits that sexual beliefs and behaviors result from individuals' lifelong accumulation of advantageous and disadvantageous experiences, and adoption/rejection of sexual scripts, within socio-historical contexts. Women and men follow distinctive sexual trajectories insofar as they accrue gender-specific experiences and scripts and as their sexuality and gender trajectories intertwine. Empirical examples include virginity loss and involuntary celibacy, (de) coupling, and chronic illness/disability. The proposed framework helps explain the coexistence of differences and similarities among individuals and cohorts and holds particular promise for studying lifelong aspects of sexuality like agency and interest. It also suggests improvements on interactionist theory, conventional life course models, and the sexual scripting approach.	1	Laura M. Carpenter
Gubernskaya, Zoya. 2010. 'Changing Attitudes Toward Marriage and Children in Six Countries.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:2 179-200.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	2	This article examines changes in attitudes toward marriage and children in Austria, (West) Germany, Great Britain, Ireland, the Netherlands, and the U.S. using the data from the 1988, 1994, and 2002 waves of the International Social Survey Programe (ISSP). Consistent with the ideas of the second demographic transition and the rise of post-materialism, public opinion in these countries is shifting away from traditional norms of universal marriage and childbearing. Female, never married, better educated, employed, and relatively secularized individuals hold less traditional views about marriage and children in all countries. Furthermore, attitudes of married and never married in Austria and Germany, males and females in the U.S. became more polarized, which might be attributed to public policies to increase fertility and promote traditional marriage in these countries. Large unexplained cross-national differences also point at the importance of contextual factors for understanding recent changes in support for marriage and children.	1	Zoya Gubernskaya
Teachman, Jay. 2010. 'Family Life Course Statuses and Transitions: Relationships With Health Limitations.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:2 201-219.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	2	In this study, the author uses 25 years of data taken from the 1979 National Longitudinal Study of Youth to examine the relationship between family life course statuses and transitions and work-related health limitations. The author uses a detailed set of statuses and transitions that include marriage, divorce, cohabitation, and parenthood. The measures of health used tap health limitations in the kind and amount of work that can be performed. Using a fixed-effects estimator for dichotomous outcomes, the author finds that marriage is positively related to the health of men but negatively related to the health of women. The author also finds that parenthood is not related to the health of men but is positively related to the health of women. The results also indicate that statuses are more important for determining health limitations than are transitions.	1	Jay Teachman
Fuller, Theodore. 2010. 'Relationship Status, Health, and Health Behavior: an Examination of Cohabiters and Commuters.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:2 221-245.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	2	A large amount of literature on relationship status, health, and health behavior indicates that marriage conveys health benefits. This literature, however, devotes relatively little attention to two theoretically interesting groups: unmarried cohabiters and married people who do not live with their spouse (''commuters''). The author hypothesizes that the health and health behaviors of these two groups will be intermediate between those of married people and unattached single individuals. Selective support is found for the hypothesis that the health behaviors of commuters are intermediate between those of married people and single people, but no support is found for the hypothesis that the health status of commuters is intermediate between that of married people and single people. Contrary to expectation, cohabiting persons tend to have poorer health status and health behavior than both their married and single counterparts. Also, while much previous research indicates that the health benefits of marriage are greater for men than women, the author finds that lacking a live-in partner (i.e., commuting or being single) appears to be more detrimental for women than men.	1	Theodore D.

Desmond, Scott, Kristopher Morgan & George Kikuchi. 2010. 'Religious Development: How (and Why) Does Religiosity Change From Adolescence to Young Adulthood?.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:2 247-270.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	9	Researchers have argued for longitudinal studies that focus more attention on how religious attitudes and behaviors change during adolescence and, especially, as adolescents make the transition to young adulthood. Therefore, the authors use growth curve modeling to examine the influence of parents and peers on adolescent religious service attendance and belief in the importance of religion using five waves (eight years) of the National Youth Survey (1979-1987). The results suggest adolescents who live with both of their biological parents have higher initial levels of religious service attendance, but their religious service attendance decreases more rapidly over time. The pattern of results for peer attachment is similar. Compared to adolescents with low peer attachment, adolescents with high peer attachment are more likely to attend religious services initially and to believe that religion is important, but their religious service attendance and belief in the importance of religion decreases more rapidly over time.	3	Scott A.

Kalmijn, Matthijs. 2010. 'Consequences of Racial Intermarriage for Children's Social Integration.' Sociological Perspectives. 53:2 271-286.	Sociological Perspectives	2010	3	Much has been written on ethnic and racial intermarriage, but little research is available on the social consequences of intermarriage. Are the children of mixed marriages more strongly connected to the majority, or are they incorporated in the ethnic or racial minority group? To answer this question, this article uses a minority survey from the Netherlands with data collected from both parents and children. The focus is on Antilleans and Surinamese and children of marriages in which both spouses are black are compared to children of marriages in which one spouse is white and one spouse is black. The analyses provide strong support for the integrative effects of intermarriage on children. These effects are not conditional on the socioeconomic status of the parents. Moreover, the effect on children can be explained in terms of the more diverse meeting opportunities that parents in a mixed marriage provide to their children.	1	Matthijs Kalmijn

Sociological Perspectives	2010	2	Despite the often cited idea that racial identities are socially constructed, and potentially fluid, much public policy is still based on surveys that elicit only one measure of racial identity. A number of U. S. studies have employed ``best single race'' questions on racial identification, in which multiracial respondents are asked to choose only one race to describe themselves. We extend some American studies by examining responses to a ``best single race'' survey question posed to a small sample of multiracial young people in Britain. In-depth interviews with British multiracial respondents are employed to investigate the extent to which a ``best single race'' (BSR) question captures someone's sense of attachment and belonging to a particular ethnic or racial group. In particular, we focus on how we should interpret East Asian/white respondents' choice of ``white'' as their BSR.	2	Miri Song; Ferhana Hashem

Sociological Quarterly	2010	1	This article examines a community's reaction to the poaching of a large elk. Extending the Durkheimian approach to nature, crime, law, and social control, this study discusses the anguish and anger provoked by the infraction, tributes to the fallen animal, calls for more severe and certain sanctions for poaching, and the boundaries affirmed in the incident's aftermath. The implications of this communal response to a wildlife offense for criminalization and conceptions of community are considered.	2	Paul Colomy; Robert Granfield
Somma, Nicolas. 2010. 'How Do Voluntary Organizations Foster Protest? the Role of Organizational Involvement on Individual Protest Participation.' Sociological Quarterly. 51:3 384-407.	Sociological Quarterly	2010	0	Prior research shows that members of voluntary organizations are more likely to protest than nonmembers. But why, among members, do some protest while others do not? I explore whether organizational involvement-the extent in which members engage in the ``life'' of their organizations-affects protest. I identify four dimensions of involvement-time and money contributions, participation in activities, psychological attachment, and embeddedness in interpersonal communication networks. Only the first dimension has robust effects on protest, and they are nonlinear: intermediate contributors have the highest protest rates. The three other dimensions substantially increase protest only under specific ``involvement profiles.''.	1	Nicolas M. Somma
Uecker, Jeremy & Mark Regnerus. 2010. 'Bare Market: Campus Sex Ratios, Romantic Relationships, and Sexual Behavior.' Sociological Quarterly. 51:3 408-435.	Sociological Quarterly	2010	9	Using a nationally representative sample of college women, we evaluate the effect of campus sex ratios on women's relationship attitudes and behaviors. Our results suggest that women on campuses where they comprise a higher proportion of the student body give more negative appraisals of campus men and relationships, go on fewer traditional dates, are less likely to have had a college boyfriend, and are more likely to be sexually active. These effects appear to stem both from decreased dyadic power among women on campuses where they are more numerous and from their increased difficulty locating a partner on such campuses.	2	Jeremy E.

Our study examines whether school-based segregation is predictive of arrests of juveniles for violent crimes in U.S. metro areas. Using Census, Uniform Crime Report, and Common Core data for 204 metro areas, a measure of school-based racial segregation, Theil's entropy index, is decomposed into two components: between- and within-district segregation. Findings reveal evidence of a significant interaction term: Within-district segregation is inversely associated with arrests for juvenile violence, but only in metropolitan areas with higher than average levels of between-district segregation.	2	David Eitle; Tamela McNulty Eitle

Sociological Quarterly	2010	4	Existing research on cultural stratification and consumption patterns rarely presents a cross-time comparative perspective and rarely goes back before the 1980s. This article employs a unique series of surveys on cultural participation collected in Denmark over the period 1964-2004 to map the historical development of three distinct cultural consumption groups (eclectic, moderate, limited) also identified in previous research. We report two major findings. First, the eclectic (or ``omnivorous'') cultural consumption group existed as far back as the 1960s and has since the 1980s comprised about 10 percent of the Danish population. Second, the major stratification variables-income, education, and social class-are strong predictors of cultural eclecticism in Denmark, and the predictive power of these stratification variables appears not to have declined in any substantive way over the past 40 years.	2	Mads Meier Jaeger; Tally Katz-Gerro
Ueno, Koji. 2010. 'Same-sex Experience and Mental Health During the Transition Between Adolescence and Young Adulthood.' Sociological Quarterly. 51:3 484-510.	Sociological Quarterly	2010	8	Previous research has demonstrated that people who report same-sex experience tend to have poorer mental health than heterosexual people in adolescence and adulthood. Yet, little is known about how same-sex experience is associated with changes in mental health between the two life stages. Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (n = 12,056), this study assesses patterns of same-sex experience between adolescence and young adulthood and their consequences for changes in depressive symptoms, binge drinking, and drug use. Compared to people with no same-sex experience, those who report such experience only in adolescence show greater levels of mental health problems in adolescence, but they do not show any worse mental health changes during the transition into young adulthood. People who develop their first same-sex experience in young adulthood, however, tend to show worse changes, consistent with the argument that entry into a stigmatized role is psychologically harmful. Among females, those who report same-sex experience in both life stages also show worse mental health changes, indicating that the continuity in minority status contributes to their cumulative disadvantage. However, these differences are modest, and substantial amounts of variations in mental health changes are observed within each group. Findings are used to address the dynamic aspect of mental health disparity linked to sexuality.	1	Koji Ueno
Austin, Kelly. 2010. 'Soybean Exports and Deforestation From a World-systems Perspective: a Cross-national Investigation of Comparative Disadvantage.' Sociological Quarterly. 51:3 511-536.	Sociological Quarterly	2010	2	This article draws on world-system theorizing to explore the relationship between deforestation and the vertical flow of soybean exports from less-developed nations to more-developed nations as a specific form of ecologically unequal exchange. Despite overwhelming case-study research exploring soybean-deforestation dynamics in less-developed countries, the current literature lacks any cross-national investigation of this trend. Ordinary least squares regression is used to examine whether soybean exports are associated with deforestation and if the magnitude of this relationship varies by region. Overall, the findings confirm the proposed hypotheses and suggest that having a comparative advantage in soybean production is not a viable development strategy.	1	Kelly F. Austin
Choo, Hae & Myra Ferree. 2010. 'Practicing Intersectionality in Sociological Research: a Critical Analysis of Inclusions, Interactions, and Institutions in the Study of Inequalities.' Sociological Theory. 28:2 129-149.	Sociological Theory	2010	46	In this article we ask what it means for sociologists to practice intersectionality as a theoretical and methodological approach to inequality. What are the implications for choices of subject matter and style of work? We distinguish three styles of understanding intersectionality in practice: group-centered, process-centered, and system-centered. The first. emphasizes placing multiply-marginalized groups and their perspectives at the center of the research. The second, intersectionality as a process, highlights power as relational, seeing the interactions among variables as multiplying oppressions at various points of intersection, and drawing attention to unmarked groups. Finally, seeing intersectionality as shaping the entire social system pushes analysis away from associating specific inequalities with unique institutions, instead looking for processes that are fully interactive, historically co-determining, and complex. Using several examples of recent, highly regarded qualitative studies, we draw attention to the comparative, contextual, and complex dimensions of sociological analysis that can be missing even when race, class, and gender are explicitly brought together.	2	Hae Yeon Choo; Myra Marx Ferree
Beckert, Jens. 2010. 'Institutional Isomorphism Revisited: Convergence and Divergence in Institutional Change.' Sociological Theory. 28:2 150-166.	Sociological Theory	2010	6	Under the influence of groundbreaking work by John Meyer and Brian Bowen, as well as Paul DiMaggio and Walter Powell, over the last 30 years research in the new sociological institutionalism has focused on processes of isomorphism. I argue that this is a one-sided focus that leaves out many insights from other institutional and macrosociological approaches and does not do justice to actual social change because it overlooks the role played by divergent institutional development. While the suggestion of divergent trends is not new, there have been Jew attempts to integrate divergence into the theoretical premises of the new sociological institutionalism. Based on the typology proposed by DiMaggio and Powell, I show that the mechanisms identified by them as sources of isomorphic change can support processes of divergent change as well. The theoretical challenge is to identify conditions under which these mechanisms push institutional change toward homogenization or divergence.	1	Jens Beckert
Lo, Ming-Cheng & Yun Fan. 2010. 'Hybrid Cultural Codes in Nonwestern Civil Society: Images of Women in Taiwan and Hong Kong.' Sociological Theory. 28:2 167-192.	Sociological Theory	2010	1	Scholars have established that cultural codes and styles of expression in civil society must be recognized as informal mechanisms of exclusion, calling into question the possibility of the Habermasian normative ideal of the public sphere. This article joins theoretical discussions of how to remedy this problem. Going beyond Alexander's model of ``multicultural incorporation'' and borrowing from Sewell's theory of the duality of structure, we develop a theoretical framework of code hybridization to conceptualize how civil society participants achieve civil solidarity amid multiple, potentially contradictory cultural legacies. Code hybridization is a process whereby social actors not only incorporate the cultural codes of subordinate groups into the public sphere, but in doing so also potentially transform dominant codes. We conceptualize code hybridization in terms of three analytic steps: enlargement of the terrains of signification; reinterpretation of codes; and mixing of schemas. The resulting hybridized schemas and frameworks are particularly useful cultural tools for developing visions of civil inclusiveness for young, unstable civil societies. Using a brief comparative study of the representation of women in political cartoons in Hong Kong and Taiwan, we offer a concrete example of code hybridization a process linking the codes of liberty and caring while producing alternative and more inclusive narratives during moments of political agitation.	2	Ming-Cheng M.

Ng, Kwai & Jeffrey Kidder. 2010. 'Toward a Theory of Emotive Performance: With Lessons From How Politicians Do Anger.' Sociological Theory. 28:2 193-214.	Sociological Theory	2010	2	This article treats the public display of emotion as social performance. The concept of ``emotive performance'' is developed to highlight the overlooked quality of performativity in the social use of emotion. We argue that emotive performance is reflexive, cultural, and communicative. As an active social act, emotive performance draws from the cultural repertoire of interpretative frameworks and dominant narratives. We illustrate the utility of the concept by analyzing two episodes of unrehearsed emotive performances by two well-known politicians, Bill Clinton and Jiang Zemin. The two cases demonstrate how emotion can be analyzed as a domain in which culturally specific narratives and rhetorics are used to advance the situational agenda of actors. The concept opens up a more expansive research agenda for sociology. It pushes sociologists to pay greater attention to people's experiences, interpretations, and deployments of emotions in social life.	2	Kwai Hang Ng; Jeffrey L. Kidder
Kenny, Robert. 2010. 'Beyond the Elementary Forms of Moral Life: Reflexivity and Rationality in Durkheim's Moral Theory.' Sociological Theory. 28:2 215-244.	Sociological Theory	2010	0	Was Durkheim an apologist for the authoritarianism? Is the sociology founded upon his work incapable of critical perspective; and must it operate under the presumption that social agents, including sociologists themselves, are incapable of reflexivity? Certainly some have said so, but they may be wrong. In this essay, I address these questions in the light of Durkheim's revisionary sociology of morals. I elaborate on unfinished elements in Durkheim's abruptly concluded (because of his early and unexpected death) scholarship, pointing out Durkheim's recognition that co-present moral spheres always exist in an organically complex society, and explaining how these co-present spheres obligate social agents to untether from any absolute moral affiliations. Ultimately, then, the argument shows how the solidarity/social-order relationship is transcended within Durkheim's sociology, even by Durkheim himself	1	Robert Wade Kenny
Dillon, Michele. 2010. '2009 Association for the Sociology of Religion Presidential Address Can Post-secular Society Tolerate Religious Differences.' Sociology of Religion. 71:2 139-156.	Sociology of Religion	2010	1	Amidst the visibility of religion in everyday culture and in political and civic debates, Jurgen Habermas's recent construal of post-secular society offers an intriguing shift in his approach to the accommodation of religion in the public sphere. The post-secular society is one that recognizes the relevance of religious ideas and intuitions in informing civic discourse and contributing to remedying the social pathologies of modernity. This paper welcomes Habermas's recent religious turn, but it also underscores some of the challenges and limits religion poses to its civic accommodation. The active tolerance of, and reflexive engagement with religion required of post-secular society unearths several tensions in how religion itself is understood and practiced, and in how western societies deal with religious and cultural Otherness. Moreover, while the state may appear as a neutral actor mediating religious-based civic disputes, it too is encrusted with culturally particular understandings of what is normal and normative.	1	Michele Dillon

Yukich, Grace. 2010. 'Boundary Work in Inclusive Religious Groups: Constructing Identity at the New York Catholic Worker.' Sociology of Religion. 71:2 172-196.	Sociology of Religion	2010	1	Many religious groups use symbolic boundary work to construct distinctive collective identity. While boundary drawing may be unproblematic for some, it can create conflict for ``inclusive'' groups. How do inclusive groups construct and solidify identity and commitment? If they use boundary work, how do they manage the conflict between exclusive ``othering'' and inclusiveness? I show that while members of the inclusive New York Catholic Worker use boundary work to construct distinctive identity, their boundary work takes place largely on an abstract level while they practice inclusion of the ``other'' in their concrete interactions. Building on Martin Buber's insights regarding the transformarive power of ``I-Thou'' encounters, I argue that concrete practices of inclusion outweigh boundary drawing in inclusive groups like the Catholic Worker. Group ideologies that encourage practices that cultivate openness to I-Thou relations, such as Catholic Worker personalism, therefore provide an advantage in balancing inclusive identity with boundary work.	1	Grace Yukich

Sociology of Religion	2010	5	Using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Freshmen, a sample of nearly 3,924 students at 28 of the most selective college and universities in the United States, this paper tests hypotheses about religion, academic performance, and satisfaction at college. Two measures of religiosity attending religious services every week or more and a 1 to 10 scale of observance of one's religious traditions and customs-increase the amount of hours students report spending on academic work and extracurricular activities, as well as reduce the hours students report going to parties. Even when controlling for time spent partying, studying and in extracurricular activities, regular attendance at religious services increases academic achievement. Finally, students who attend religious services weekly and those who are more observant of their religious traditions also report being more satisfied at college.	1	Margarita Mooney

Sociology of Religion	2010	1	Despite the abundant research on liberation theology and religious change in Latin America, there is little agreement regarding how to assess the political orientation of national churches. This paper reviews previous strategies and proposes that any new approach should do three things. First, the strength of liberation theology should be assessed holistically, that is, by focusing on the official statements and organizational practices of bishops, priests, nuns, and laity. Second, liberation theology should be approached as a ``family resemblance concept'' and not a ``classic concept.'' Third, while most scholars identify national churches in nominal terms, I argue liberation theology varies along a continuum, from strong to weak and that its strength varies over time. The cases of Chile, Mexico, and Colombia are presented. The paper closes with a call for future research.	1	Robert Sean Mackin
Crossley, Nick. 2010. 'Networks and Complexity: Directions for Interactionist Research?.' Symbolic Interaction. 33:3 341-363.	Symbolic Interaction	2010	3	In this article I consider the potential importance of social networks for symbolic interactionism. Specifically, I argue that symbolic interactionism operates with an underdeveloped and often tacit conception of networks; that network analysis offers us various tools for further developing and operationalizing this conception, empirically; and that doing so would be to our considerable advantage. In addition, I argue that a stronger focus on networks would give interactionism an inroad into important contemporary debates on ``complexity,'' building on an obvious but again underdeveloped affinity between these two academic domains. Moreover, tackling complexity raises important and central sociological concerns of structure/agency and micro/macro, with the additional payoff that interactionism can develop and demonstrate its strengths, as an approach, in addressing the problems often associated with these concerns.	1	Nick Crossley

Symbolic Interaction	2010	1	The aim of this article is to respond to the question of whether social networks represent a possible terrain of application and investment for interactionist research. The answer to that question is, without a doubt, affirmative. What appears to be truly problematic, if not completely improbable, is that this investment can come about through a ``coming together'' of symbolic interactionism and social network analysis. The vocational focus that has evolved in the two perspectives, the conceptual frameworks and methods used for the study of social interactions and their interlinking in relational networks, presents aspects of extreme differentiation that render a possible convergence quite difficult.	1	Andrea Salvini

Symbolic Interaction	2010	2	Despite a good deal of work on pain as a social/emotional construction, the assumption persists that pain is understood and experienced as inherently and originally negative. Postmodern and constructionist treatments of pain alike focus on negotiations and mediations of pain from that point forward. This article explores the ways in which members of an SM (sadomasochism) community frame, cast, and understand the role of pain in their SM activities, toward the ultimate achievement of authenticity in experiences of power-imbalanced social interaction. This analysis, based on an in-depth ethnographic study of an SM community, identifies four main discourses of pain, three of which conform to hegemonic understandings of pain as intrinsically negative experience. It reveals the complex strategies SM participants employ to make sense of pain and contrasts this with a minority discourse in the community in which the provision and experience of pain is framed as a desirable social, carnal, and emotional experience.	1	Staci Newmahr
Reich, Jennifer. 2010. 'Children's Challenges to Efforts to Save Them: Competing Knowledges in the Child Welfare System.' Symbolic Interaction. 33:3 412-434.	Symbolic Interaction	2010	1	The child welfare system is founded on a belief that children are sometimes endangered by their parents or caregivers and must be saved by agents of the state. Children are perceived as objects to be saved, but they are rarely seen as active strategists in their interactions with child welfare system social workers. Using ethnographic data collected during observations of social workers and juvenile court proceedings, this article shows how children have their own complex understandings of state intervention and strive-to varying degrees of success-to contest official views of their lives and provide competing forms of knowledge. Specifically, children attempt to rework state actors' perceptions of their families and familial problems, use state actors as an audience for their versions of their lives, and attempt to mobilize state power for personal or material gain.	1	Jennifer A.

Kraus, Rachel. 2010. '``we Are Not Strippers'': How Belly Dancers Manage a (soft) Stigmatized Serious Leisure Activity.' Symbolic Interaction. 33:3 435-455.	Symbolic Interaction	2010	3	Most stigma research examines people who engage in deviant activities or possess visible and permanent discredited attributes, which lead to ``hard'' or severe consequences. Existing leisure studies focus on the benefits of leisure pursuits. Less attention is paid to the potential costs associated with serious leisure, such as ``soft'' stigma. The snubs and slight embarrassments resulting from soft stigma may jeopardize the rewards people receive from participating in leisure, such as a sense of identity, self-worth, and pride. Using interviews with seventy-four female belly dancers, most of whom belly dance as a form of ``serious leisure,'' this article examines how dancers manage perceptions that they are erotic dancers. Results show that dancers use an interesting set of stigma management techniques and new forms of some existing management strategies to simultaneously protect themselves and enhance the reputation of the group. Implications for how people negotiate soft stigma associated with serious leisure are discussed.	1	Rachel Kraus
Merrill, Bryce. 2010. 'Music to Remember Me By: Technologies of Memory in Home Recording.' Symbolic Interaction. 33:3 456-474.	Symbolic Interaction	2010	2	This article presents ethnographic data on home music recording to advance the concept of technologies of memory as way for interactionists to understand memory work as a practice of self. John Dewey's classic ruminations on memory as process are combined with Tia DeNora's contemporary articulation of music as a technology of the self to explain data on home recording as individually and socially meaningful mnemonic work. This specific case study demonstrates how home recordists use material technologies (technics) and technological practices (techniques) to form and reform the self in everyday life. More generally, this article demonstrates the efficacy of interpretive studies of memory, creativity, technology, and the self in everyday life.	1	Bryce Merrill
Hughey, Matthew. 2010. 'the White Savior Film and Reviewers' Reception.' Symbolic Interaction. 33:3 475-496.	Symbolic Interaction	2010	3	This article documents the collective interpretations of film reviewers, a position typically associated with individual aesthetic judgment rather than socially shared scripts of explanation. Drawing on the reviews of a feature film with implicit racial content, produced in the context of a supposedly ``color-blind'' era, this article documents how reviewers constitute a racialized interpretive community. Reviewers rely on specific cultural frameworks to both contest and reproduce the notion of a ``post-racial'' society. These interpretations equate nonwhites with pathological and dysfunctional traits, frame hard work as a white normative characteristic, and construct deterministic views of both Hollywood's ability to represent progressive racial representations and the educational system's potential. This analysis illustrates how film reviews operate as mediating voices between producer and consumer, and in so doing, the interpretations of the film serve as ``common-sensed'' mappings of the contested terrain of contemporary race relations.	1	Matthew W.

DiPrete, Thomas, Gregory Eirich & Matthew Pittinsky. 2010. 'Compensation Benchmarking, Leapfrogs, and the Surge in Executive Pay.' American Journal of Sociology. 115:6 1671-1712.	American Journal of Sociology	2010	12	Scholars frequently argue whether the sharp rise in chief executive officer (CEO) pay in recent years is ``efficient'' or is a consequence of ``rent extraction'' because of the failure of corporate governance in individual firms. This article argues that governance failure must be conceptualized at the market rather than the firm level because excessive pay increases for even relatively few CEOs a year spread to other firms through the cognitively and rhetorically constructed compensation networks of ``peer groups,'' which are used in the benchmarking process to negotiate the compensation of CEOs. Counterfactual simulation based on Standard and Poor's ExecuComp data demonstrates that the effects of CEO ``leapfrogging'' potentially explain a considerable fraction of the overall upward movement of executive compensation since the early 1990s.	3	Thomas A.

American Journal of Sociology	2010	4	In recent years there has been a growing call to historicize sociology by paying more attention to the contextual importance of time and place as well as to issues of process and contingency. Meeting this goal requires bringing historical sociology and interactionism into greater conversation via a historical theory of social situations. Toward this end, the authors of this article draw on Erving Goffman's work in Frame Analysis to conceptualize experience in social situations as grounded in multilayered cognitive frames and to demonstrate how such a framework helps illuminate historical changes in situated interaction.	2	David Diehl; Daniel McFarland

American Journal of Sociology. 115:6 1753-1799.	American Journal of Sociology	2010	16	The expansion of the U. S. penal system has important consequences for poverty and inequality, yet little is known about the imposition of monetary sanctions. This study analyzes national and state-level court data to assess their imposition and interview data to identify their social and legal consequences. Findings indicate that monetary sanctions are imposed on a substantial majority of the millions of people convicted of crimes in the United States annually and that legal debt is substantial relative to expected earnings. This indebtedness reproduces disadvantage by reducing family income, by limiting access to opportunities and resources, and by increasing the likelihood of ongoing criminal justice involvement.	3	Alexes Harris; Heather Evans; Katherine Beckett

American Journal of Sociology	2010	7	AIDS media lead unexpected lives once distributed through urban space: billboards fade, posters go missing, bumper stickers travel to other cities. The materiality of AIDS campaign objects and of the urban settings in which they are displayed structures how the public interprets their messages. Ethnographic observation of AIDS media in situ and interview data reveal how the materiality of objects and places shapes the availability of AIDS knowledge in Accra, Ghana. Significantly for AIDS organizations, these material conditions often systematically obstruct access to AIDS knowledge for particular groups. Attending to materiality rethinks how scholars assess the cultural power of media.	1	Terence E. McDonnell

American Journal of Sociology	2010	1	This essay uses a deviant case analysis of the 1995-2000 Detroit newspaper strike to critique and revise theories of strike activity. As the formal institutions regulating industrial relations in the United States have declined, workplace struggles have expanded or reentered into other arenas of the state and civil society. In addition, the essay develops the methodological concept of a ``signal juncture,'' that is, moments of conflict that reveal a ``collision'' of underlying developmental paths. Unlike the more familiar concept of the critical juncture, a signal juncture reveals ongoing structural tensions and conflicting actors within otherwise continuous trends.	1	Chris Rhomberg
Stolzenberg, Ross & James Lindgren. 2010. 'Retirement and Death in Office of Us Supreme Court Justices.' Demography. 47:2 269-298.	Demography	2010	7	We construct demographic models of retirement and death in office of U.S. Supreme Court justices, a group that has gained demographic notice, evaded demographic analysis, and is said to diverge from expected retirement patterns. Models build on prior multistate labor force status studies, and data permit an unusually clear distinction between voluntary and ``induced'' retirement. Using data on every justice from 1789 through 2006, with robust, cluster-corrected, discrete-tune, censored, event-history methods, we (1) estimate retirement effects of pension eligibility, age, health, and tenure on the timing of justices' retirements and deaths in office, (2) resolve decades of debate over the politicized departure hypothesis that justices tend to alter the timing of their retirements for the political benefit or detriment of the incumbent president, (3) reconsider the nature of rationality in retirement decisions, and (4) consider the relevance of organizational conditions as well as personal circumstances to retirement decisions. Methodological issues are addressed.	2	Ross M. Stolzenberg; James Lindgren
Canudas-Romo, Vladimir. 2010. 'Three Measures of Longevity: Time Trends and Record Values.' Demography. 47:2 299-312.	Demography	2010	9	This article examines the trend over time in the measures of ``typical'' longevity experienced by members of a population: life expectancy at birth, and the median and modal ages at death. The article also analyzes trends in record values observed for all three measures. The record life expectancy at birth increased from a level of 44 years in Sweden in 1840 to 82 years in Japan in 2005. The record median age at death shows increasing patterns similar to those observed in life expectancy at birth. However, the record modal age at death changes very little until the second half of the twentieth century: it moved from a plateau level, around age 80, to having a similar pace of increase as that observed for the mean and the median in most recent years. These findings explain the previously observed uninterrupted increase in the record life expectancy. The cause of this increase has changed over time from a dominance of child mortality reductions to a dominance of adult mortality reductions, which became evident by studying trends in the record modal age at death.	1	Vladimir Canudas-Romo
Drefahl, Sven. 2010. 'How Does the Age Gap Between Partners Affect Their Survival?.' Demography. 47:2 313-326.	Demography	2010	2	I use hazard regression methods to examine how the age difference between spouses affects their survival. In many countries, the age difference between spouses at marriage has remained relatively stable for several decades. In Denmark, men are, on average, about three years older than the women they marry. Previous studies of the age gap between spouses with respect to mortality found that having a younger spouse is beneficial, while having an older spouse is detrimental for one's own survival. Most of the observed effects could not be explained satisfactorily until now, mainly because of methodological drawbacks and insufficiency of the data. The most common explanations refer to selection effects, caregiving in later life, and some positive psychological and sociological effects of having a younger spouse. The present study extends earlier work by using longitudinal Danish register data that include the entire history of key demographic events of the whole population from 1990 onward. Controlling for confounding factors such as education and wealth, results suggest that having a younger spouse is beneficial for men but detrimental for women, while having an older spouse is detrimental for both sexes.	1	Sven Drefahl
Liu, Kayuet, Noam Zerubavel & Peter Bearman. 2010. 'Social Demographic Change and Autism.' Demography. 47:2 327-343.	Demography	2010	12	Parental age at child's birth-which has increased for U.S. children in the 1992-2000 birth cohorts-is strongly associated with an increased risk of autism. By turning a social demographic lens on the historical patterning of concordance among twin pairs, we identify a central mechanism for this association: de novo mutations, which are deletions, insertions, and duplications of DNA in the germ cells that are not present in the parents' DNA. Along the way, we show that a demographic eye on the rising prevalence of autism leads to three major discoveries. First, the estimated heritability of autism has been dramatically overstated. Second, heritability estimates can change over remarkably short periods of time because of increases in germ cell mutations. Third, social demographic change can yield genetic changes that, at the population level, combine to contribute to the increased prevalence of autism.	3	Kayuet Liu; Noam Zerubavel; Peter Bearman
Zissimopoulos, Julie & Lynn Karoly. 2010. 'Employment and Self-employment in the Wake of Hurricane Katrina.' Demography. 47:2 345-367.	Demography	2010	1	We use data from the monthly Current Population Survey to examine the short- and longer-term effects of Hurricane Katrina on the labor market outcomes of prime-age individuals in the most affected states-Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi-and for evacuees in any state. We focus on rates of labor force participation, employment, and unemployment, and we extend prior research by also examining rates of self-employment. With the exception of Mississippi, employment and unemployment one year after the hurricane were at similar rates as the end of 2003. This aggregate pattern of labor market shock and recovery has been observed for other disasters but masks important differences among subgroups. Those evacuated from their residences, even temporarily, were a harder-hit group, and evacuees who had yet to return to their pre-Katrina state up to one year later were hit especially hard; these findings hold even after controlling for differences in observable characteristics. We also find evidence of an important role for self-employment as part of post-disaster labor market recovery, especially for evacuees who did not return. This may result from poor job prospects in the wage and salary sector or new opportunities for starting businesses in the wake of Katrina.	2	Julie Zissimopoulos; Lynn A. Karoly
Park, Julie & Dowell Myers. 2010. 'Intergenerational Mobility in the Post-1965 Immigration Era: Estimates by an Immigrant Generation Cohort Method.' Demography. 47:2 369-392.	Demography	2010	4	The new second generation of the post-1965 immigration era is observed as children with their parents in 1980 and again as adults 25 years later. Intergenerational mobility is assessed for both men and women in four major racial/ethnic groups, both in regard to children's status attainment relative to parents and with regard to the rising societal standards proxied by native-born non-Hispanic whites. A profile of intergenerational mobility is prepared using multiple indicators of status attainment: high school and college completion, upper white-collar occupation, poverty, and homeownership. The immigrant generation cohort method we introduce accounts for four distinct temporal dimensions of immigrant progress, clarifying inconsistencies in the literature and highlighting differences in mobility between racial/ethnic groups and with respect to different outcome measures. The immigrant generation cohort method consistently finds greater intergenerational mobility than suggested by alternative approaches. Our analysis also shows that the intergenerational progress of women is greater than that of men and provides a more complete record of immigrant mobility overall. Findings for individual racial/ethnic groups accord with some expectations in the literature and contradict others.	2	Julie Park; Dowell Myers
Miller, Warren, David Bard, David Pasta & Joseph Rodgers. 2010. 'Biodemographic Modeling of the Links Between Fertility Motivation and Fertility Outcomes in the Nlsy79.' Demography. 47:2 393-414.	Demography	2010	3	In spite of long-held beliefs that traits related to reproductive success tend to become fixed by evolution with little or no genetic variation, there is now considerable evidence that the natural variation of fertility within populations is genetically influenced and that a portion of that influence is related to the motivational precursors to fertility. We conduct a two-stage analysis to examine these inferences in a time-ordered multivariate context. First, using data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, 1979, and LISREL analysis, we develop a structural equation model in which five hypothesized motivational precursors to fertility, measured in 1979-1982, predict both a child-timing and a child-number outcome, measured in 2002. Second, having chosen two time-ordered sequences of six variables from the SEM to represent our phenotypic models, we use Mx to conduct both univariate and multivariate behavioral genetic analyses with the selected variables. Our results indicate that one or more genes acting within a gene network have additive effects that operate through child-number desires to affect both the timing of the next child born and the final number of children born, that one or more genes acting through a separate network may have additive effects operating through gender role attitudes to produce downstream effects on the two fertility outcomes, and that no genetic variance is associated with either child-timing intentions or educational intentions.	4	Warren B.

Hofferth, Sandra & Frances Goldscheider. 2010. 'Family Structure and the Transition to Early Parenthood.' Demography. 47:2 415-437.	Demography	2010	10	With the rise in out-of-wedlock childbearing and divorce in the last quarter of the twentieth century, an increasing proportion of children have been exposed to a variety of new family forms. Little research has focused on the consequences of childhood family structure for men's transition to fatherhood or on the family processes that account for the effects of family structure on the likelihood that young women and men become first-time unmarried parents, what we now call ``fragile families.'' The data come from the linked Children and Young Adult samples of the 1979 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY79), which provide information on the children of the women of the NLSY79 from birth until they enter young adulthood. Females growing up with a single parent and males experiencing an unstable family transition to parenthood early, particularly to nonresidential fatherhood for males. For males, the effects are strongly mediated by parenting processes and adolescent behaviors and are shaped by economic circumstances. Having experienced multiple transitions as a child is associated with a reduced likelihood that males father their first child within marriage and an increased likelihood that they become fathers within cohabitation, demonstrating how changes in family structure alter family structure patterns over time and generations.	2	Sandra L.

Van, Jan. 2010. 'Choice of Study Discipline and the Postponement of Motherhood in Europe: the Impact of Expected Earnings, Gender Composition, and Family Attitudes.' Demography. 47:2 439-458.	Demography	2010	9	Theory suggests that the field of study may be at least as consequential for fertility behavior as the duration and level of education. Yet, this qualitative dimension of educational achievement has been largely neglected in demographic studies. This article analyzes the mechanisms relating the field of study with the postponement of motherhood by European college-graduate women aged 20-40. The second round of the European Social Survey is used to assess the impact of four features of study disciplines that are identified as key to reproductive decision making: the expected starting wage, the steepness of the earning profile, attitudes toward gendered family roles, and gender composition. The results indicate that the postponement of motherhood is relatively limited among graduates from study disciplines in which stereotypical attitudes about family roles prevail and in which a large share of the graduates are female. Both the level of the starting wage and the steepness of the earning profile are found to be associated with greater postponement. These results are robust to controlling for the partnership situation and the age at entry into the labor market.	1	Jan Van

Demography	2010	14	Little is known about the validity of group-level theories of ethnic intermarriage despite the fact that such theories are often invoked in explaining why certain ethnic groups are ``closed,'' whereas others are relatively ``open.'' We develop a comparative perspective by analyzing the marriage choices of 94 national-origin groups in the United States, using pooled data from the Current Population Surveys, 1994-2006, and multilevel models in which individual and contextual determinants of intermarriage are included simultaneously. Our analyses show large differences in endogamy across groups. After taking compositional effects into account, we find that both structural and cultural group-level factors have significant effects on endogamy. Cultural explanations (which focus on the role of norms and preferences) play a more important role than structural explanations (which focus on meeting and mating opportunities). Our results reinforce the common but untested interpretation of endogamy in terms of group boundaries.	2	Matthijs Kalmijn; Frank Van
Torche, Florencia. 2010. 'Educational Assortative Mating and Economic Inequality: a Comparative Analysis of Three Latin American Countries.' Demography. 47:2 481-502.	Demography	2010	5	Educational assortative mating and economic inequality are likely to be endogenously determined, but very little research exists on their empirical association. Using census data and log-linear and log-multiplicative methods, I compare the patterns of educational assortative mating in Brazil, Chile, and Mexico, and explore the association between marital sorting and earnings inequality across countries. The analysis finds substantial variation in the strength of specific barriers to educational intermarriage between countries, and a close association between these barriers and the earnings gaps across educational categories within countries. This finding suggests an isomorphism between assortative mating and economic inequality. Furthermore, educational marital sorting is remarkably symmetric across gender in spite of the different resources that men and women bring to the union. This study highlights the limitations of using single aggregate measures of spousal educational resemblance (such as the correlation coefficient between spouses `schooling) to capture variation in assortative mating and its relationship with socioeconomic inequality.	1	Florencia Torche
Kalwij, Adriaan. 2010. 'the Impact of Family Policy Expenditure on Fertility in Western Europe.' Demography. 47:2 503-519.	Demography	2010	7	This article analyzes the impact on fertility of changes in national expenditure for family allowances, maternity- and parental-leave benefits, and childcare subsidies. To do so, I estimate a model for the timing of births using individual-level data from 16 western European countries, supplemented with data on national social expenditure for different family policy programs. The latter allow approximation of the subsidies that households with children receive from such programs. The results show that increased expenditure on family policy programs that help women to combine family and employment-and thus reduce the opportunity cost of children-generates positive fertility responses.	1	Adriaan Kalwij
Basu, Deepankar & Robert De. 2010. 'Son Targeting Fertility Behavior: Some Consequences and Determinants.' Demography. 47:2 521-536.	Demography	2010	5	This article draws out some implications of son targeting fertility behavior and studies its determinants. We demonstrate that such behavior has two notable implications at the aggregate level: (a) girls have a larger number of siblings (sibling effect), and (b) girls are born at relatively earlier parities within families (birth-order effect). Empirically testing for these effects, we find that both are present in many countries in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and North Africa but are absent in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Using maximum likelihood estimation, we study the effect of covariates on son targeting fertility behavior in India, a country that displays significant sibling and birth-order effects. We find that income and geographic location of families significantly affect son targeting behavior.	2	Deepankar Basu; Robert De
Matzat, Uwe & Chris Snijders. 2010. 'Does the Online Collection of Ego-centered Network Data Reduce Data Quality? an Experimental Comparison.' Social Networks. 32:2 105-111.	Social Networks	2010	4	We analyze whether differences in kind and quality of ego-centered network data are related to whether the data are collected online or offline. We report the results of two studies. In the first study respondents could choose between filling out ego-centered data through a web questionnaire and being probed about their network in a personalized interview. The second study used a design in which respondents were allocated at random to either online or offline data collection. Our results show that the data quality suffers from the online data collection and the findings indicate that this is the consequence of the respondents answering ``mechanically''. We conclude that network researchers should avoid to simply COPY traditional network items into a web questionnaire. More research is needed about how new design elements specific for web questionnaires can motivate respondents to fill out network questions properly.	2	Uwe Matzat; Chris Snijders
Wejnert, Cyprian. 2010. 'Social Network Analysis With Respondent-driven Sampling Data: a Study of Racial Integration on Campus.' Social Networks. 32:2 112-124.	Social Networks	2010	3	This paper presents respondent-driven sampling (RDS) as a viable method of sampling and analyzing social networks with survey data. RDS is a network based sampling and analysis method that provides a middle ground compliment to ego-centric and saturated methods of social network analysis. The method provides survey data, similar to ego-centric approaches, on individuals who are connected by behaviorally documented ties, allowing for macro-level analysis of network structure, similar to that supported by saturated approaches. Using racial interaction of university undergraduates as an empirical example, the paper examines whether and to what extent racial diversity at the institutional level is reflected as racial integration at the interpersonal level by testing hypotheses regarding the quantity and quality of cross-race friendships. The primary goal of this article, however, is to introduce RDS to the network community and to stimulate further research toward the goal of expanding the analytical capacity of RDS. Advantages, limitations, and areas for future research to network analysis using RDS are discussed.	1	Cyprian Wejnert
Boyd, John, William Fitzgerald, Matthew Mahutga & David Smith. 2010. 'Computing Continuous Core/periphery Structures for Social Relations Data With Minres/svd.' Social Networks. 32:2 125-137.	Social Networks	2010	4	When diagonal values are missing or excluded, MINRES is a natural continuous model for the core/periphery structure of a symmetric social network matrix. Symmetric models, however, are not so useful when dealing with asymmetric data. Singular value decomposition (SVD) is a natural choice to model asymmetry, but this method also requires the presence of diagonal values. In this paper we offer an alternative, more general, approach to continuous core/periphery structures, the minimum residual singular value decomposition (MINRES/SVD), where each node in the network receives two indices, an ``in-coreness'' and an ``out-coreness.'' The algorithm for computing these coreness vectors is a least squares computation similar to, but distinct from the SVD, again because of the missing diagonal values. And in contrast to the standard, symmetric MINRES algorithm, we can more accurately model asymmetric matrices. This allows us to distinguish, for example, countries in the world economy that are more in the exporting core than they are in the importing core. We propose two nested PRE (proportional reduction of error) measures of fit: (1) the PRE from the MINRES vector with respect to the data and (2) the PRE of the product of the two MINRES/SVD vectors. Applying the resulting method to citations between journals and to international trade in clothing, we illustrate insights gained from being able to model asymmetrical flow patterns. Finally, two permutation tests are introduced to test independently for the MINRES and MINRES/SVD results.	4	John P. Boyd; William J. Fitzgerald; Matthew C. Mahutga; David A. Smith

'the Interactive Effects of Political Skill and Future Time Perspective on Career and Community Networking Behavior.' Social Networks. 32:2 138-147.	Social Networks	2010	5	Scholars have suggested that skill (Ferris et al., 2007) and motivation (Forret and Dougherty, 2001) need to be considered in predicting the direction and intensity of networking behaviors. Congruently, the present study argues that skill and motivation operate interactively and assesses the interactive impact of political skill (i.e., the ability to interact effectively with others) and future time perspective on differentially predicting community-based and career-based networking behavior. Results from a sample of managers from a national retail chain (n = 291) indicated that politically skilled individuals who possessed a deep future time perspective were more involved in career-related networking than politically skilled individuals who perceived a shallow future time perspective. Additionally, politically skilled respondents with shallow organizational time perspectives engaged in higher levels of community-based networking than did their counterparts with deeper organizational time perspectives. The implications of these findings are discussed in terms of political skill, social networks, and socioemotional selectivity theory.	5	Darren C. Treadway; Jacob W. Breland; Garry L.

Social Networks. 32:2 148-159.	Social Networks	2010	4	This study links social network methodology with the social disorganization literature to test the effect of block-level social distance on neighborhood perceived crime and disorder. Employing a unique study design that allows creating matrices of social distance (based on demographic characteristics) between 11 residents on each of over 650 blocks at three time points, we find that more socially distant residents perceive more disorder than their neighbors. Consistent with the bridging social capital literature, overall social distance in the block has a curvilinear relationship with perceived crime. And blocks with two cohesive subgroups, based on social distance, have lower levels of perceived disorder.	1	John R. Hipp
Dixon, Marc. 2010. 'Union Threat, Countermovement Organization, and Labor Policy in the States, 1944-1960.' Social Problems. 57:2 157-174.	Social Problems	2010	4	This article evaluates social movement perspectives on repression and movement-countermovement organization relative to the wave of policy setbacks that unions experienced in the pivotal two decades following the New Deal. An event history analysis of the adoption of right-to-work laws across states between 1944 and 1960 supports social movement perspectives that emphasize the relative threat posed by challenging groups, but the impact of threat is uneven. The findings advance a more contextualized and historically grounded understanding, demonstrating how union threat takes on greater meaning in contexts where authorities side with employers relative to labor. This study improves upon prior labor scholarship by including data on both union and employer organization, each of which are shown to be influential for right-to-work outcomes independent of notable political opportunities. I conclude by discussing the implications of the findings for scholarship on labor and social movements more generally.	1	Marc Dixon
Edgell, Penny & Eric Tranby. 2010. 'Shared Visions? Diversity and Cultural Membership in American Life.' Social Problems. 57:2 175-204.	Social Problems	2010	7	Sociological theory and public discourse raise concerns about division, fragmentation, or attenuation in our collective life rooted in, among other things, racial or religious differences, but we know very little about how ordinary Americans imagine themselves as similar to and different from their fellow citizens. In a recent, nationally representative telephone survey (2003, N = 2081) we asked over 2,000 Americans whether the members of ten different racial/ethnic, religious, or social groups ``share your vision of America.'' We used cluster analysis and found three patterns of responses to this set of questions, patterns that reflect differences in social location and correspond to different views of diversity, group stereotypes, and understandings of American society. We argue that what we find reveals different dimensions along which Americans draw symbolic boundaries in public life, and that how these boundaries are drawn is rooted in three different visions of America. Optimistic pluralists believe in the positive value of diversity and are unwilling to exclude people on the basis of religion, ethnicity, or lifestyle; critics of multiculturalism are critical of diversity and are wary about contemporary social changes and political and social ``out-groups;'' and cultural preservationists imagine an America with a moral order underpinned by shared values and a history of a unified white, Christian culture. In the conclusion, we discuss the implications of these findings for scholarship on multiculturalism and the ``culture wars,'' and we call for more research on how ordinary Americans interpret the meanings and implications of social differences in public life.	2	Penny Edgell; Eric Tranby
Hipp, John. 2010. 'a Dynamic View of Neighborhoods: the Reciprocal Relationship Between Crime and Neighborhood Structural Characteristics.' Social Problems. 57:2 205-230.	Social Problems	2010	14	Prior research frequently observes a positive cross-sectional relationship between various neighborhood structural characteristics and crime rates, and attributes the causal explanation entirely to these structural characteristics. We question this assumption theoretically, proposing a household-level model showing that neighborhood crime might also change these structural characteristics. We test these hypotheses using data on census tracts in 13 cities over a ten-year period, and our cross-lagged models generally find that, if anything, crime is the stronger causal force in these possible relationships. Neighborhoods with more crime tend to experience increasing levels of residential instability, more concentrated disadvantage, a diminishing retail environment, and more African Americans ten years later. Although we find that neighborhoods with more concentrated disadvantage experience increases in violent and property crime, there is no evidence that residential instability or the presence of African Americans increases crime rates ten years later.	1	John R.

Saguy, Abigail & Kjerstin Gruys. 2010. 'Morality and Health: News Media Constructions of Overweight and Eating Disorders.' Social Problems. 57:2 231-250.	Social Problems	2010	26	This article examines how widely shared cultural values shape social problem construction and, in turn, can reproduce social inequality. To do so, we draw on a comparative case study of American news reporting on eating disorders and overweight/obesity between 1995 and 2005. In the contemporary United States, thinness is associated with high social status and taken as evidence of moral virtue. In contrast, fatness is linked to low status and seen as a sign of sloth and gluttony. Drawing on an original data set of news reports, we examine how such social and moral meanings of body size inform news reporting on eating disorders and overweight. We find that the news media in our sample typically discuss how a host of complex factors beyond individual control contribute to anorexia and bulimia. In that anorexics and bulimics are typically portrayed as young white women or girls, this reinforces cultural images of young white female victims. In contrast, the media predominantly attribute overweight to bad individual choices and tend to treat binge eating disorder as ordinary and blameworthy overeating. In that the poor and minorities are more likely to be heavy, such reporting reinforces social stereotypes of fat people, ethnic minorities, and the poor as out of control and lazy. While appreciation for bigger female bodies among African Americans is hailed as protecting against thinness-oriented eating disorders, this same cultural preference is partially blamed for overweight and obesity among African American women and girls.	2	Abigail C.

Wingfield, Adia. 2010. 'Are Some Emotions Marked ``whites Only''? Racialized Feeling Rules in Professional Workplaces.' Social Problems. 57:2 251-268.	Social Problems	2010	8	Much of the research on emotion work in organizations has focused on the ways in which emotional performance reproduces gender inequality. Yet, most of these studies overlook the racial character of professional workplaces and how emotion work is experienced by racial/ethnic minorities. In this article, I examine how the normative feeling rules that guide emotional performance in professional workplaces are racialized rather than neutral or objective criteria. Based on 25 semistructured interviews with black professionals, I contend that feeling rules have different implications for black workers and ultimately reinforce racial difference. This research contributes to the sociological literature on emotion work by further developing the racial components of emotional performance.	1	Adia Harvey Wingfield
Bjornstrom, Eileen, Robert Kaufman, Ruth Peterson & Michael Slater. 2010. 'Race and Ethnic Representations of Lawbreakers and Victims in Crime News: a National Study of Television Coverage.' Social Problems. 57:2 269-293.	Social Problems	2010	4	Research on racial-ethnic portrayals in television crime news is limited and questions remain about the sources of representations and how these vary for perpetrators versus victims. We draw from power structure, market share, normal crimes, racial threat, and racial privileging perspectives to further this research. The reported race or ethnicity of violent crime perpetrators and victims are modeled as functions of: (1) situational characteristics of crime stories and (2) contextual characteristics of television market areas. The primary data are from a stratified random sample of television newscasts in 2002-2003 (Long et al. 2005). An important innovation of our work is the use of a national, more generalizeable, sample of local news stories than prior researchers who tended to focus on single market areas. Results indicate that both the context of the story itself and the social structural context within which news stories are reported are relevant to ethnic and racial portrayals in crime news. We find limited support for power structure, market share, normal crimes, and racial threat explanations of patterns of reporting. Racial privileging arguments receive more extensive support.	4	Eileen E. Bjornstrom; Robert L. Kaufman; Ruth D. Peterson; Michael D. Slater
Sallaz, Jeffrey. 2010. 'Talking Race, Marketing Culture: the Racial Habitus in and Out of Apartheid.' Social Problems. 57:2 294-314.	Social Problems	2010	4	This article uses the concept of habitus to address the puzzle of past-in-present racial formations. Although formal ideologies of white supremacy may be suddenly overturned, the embodied dispositions of the habitus should prove durable and may even improvise new practices that transpose old racial schemata into new settings. Evidence for these propositions derives from an ethnography of marketing practices inside a leisure firm in post-apartheid South Africa. In the organizational backstage, veteran white managers routinely categorize consumers as desired ``whities'' versus denigrated ``darkies.'' But a second discourse of marketing, found in the frontstage, uses survey data to divide the market into ``blue-collar'' and ``jazz'' types. By structuring marketing strategy to attract the former and repel the latter, managers exclude black consumers and euphemize such exclusion vis-a-vis the state and other public audiences. Findings extend not only racial formation theory, but also U.S.-based understandings of discrimination.	1	Jeffrey J. Sallaz
Axinn, William, Jennifer Barber & Ann Biddlecom. 2010. 'Social Organization and the Transition From Direct to Indirect Consumption.' Social Science Research. 39:3 357-368.	Social Science Research	2010	3	This paper presents a new theoretical framework for the study of environmental consumption at the micro-level by building on concepts from classical sociological theory and recent macro-level studies of the environment. The framework emphasizes the local community context as an important determinant of environmental consumption. We test this framework with unique Micro-level data on consumption, household size, household affluence, and community context from Nepal, a setting in the midst of dramatic change in community organization, population size, and consumption behavior. The results of these tests are consistent with the hypothesis that local non-family organizations shift the consumption of environmental resources from direct to more indirect. We argue that the framework presented here is a useful early step toward more comprehensive micro-level models of environmental quality. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	3	William G.

Social Science Research	2010	2	This paper proposes a model of selective mobility of workers from the state sector to the market sector to illustrate how the market transition has led to earnings inequality in former state socialist countries. Analysis of the survey data collected in 2000 from 10 Chinese cities reveals that recent entrants into the market are driven by two different institutional processes some are self-selected for higher economic returns (voluntary entrants) and some are pushed into the market through layoffs (involuntary entrants), resulting in a more heterogeneous body of workers in the market sector than before. Linear regression results show that the commonly observed higher earnings in the market sector are limited only to a subgroup of later entrants who enter the sector voluntarily. Propensity-score matching analyses further demonstrate that the effect of a late market entry on earnings is negatively associated with the propensity of making such a transition. Those who would otherwise do well in the state sector and therefore have a lower propensity for entering the market benefit more from the entry. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Social Science Research. 39:3 396-404.	Social Science Research	2010	19	Cross-national comparisons of the prevalence of depression in general populations are hampered by the absence of comparable data. Using information on the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms from the third wave of the European Social Survey (ESS-3), we are able to fill this gap. In the ESS-3, depression is measured with an 8-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D 8) scale. Using multi-group confirmatory factor analysis, we assess configural, metric, and scalar measurement invariance of the CES-D 8. Next, best fitting factor models are used for latent mean comparisons of women and men in the 25 participating European countries. The present study is the first to present highly comparable data on the prevalence of depression in women and men in Europe. Results show that, after eliminating measurement bias, the gender difference in depression stays significant and regional clustering can be noted. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Social Science Research. 39:3 405-418.	Social Science Research	2010	5	The development of conceptual frameworks for the analysis of social exclusion has somewhat out-stripped related methodological developments. This paper seeks to contribute to filling this gap through the application of self-organising maps (SOMs) to the analysis of a detailed set of material deprivation indicators relating to the Irish case. The SOM approach allows us to offer a differentiated and interpretable picture of the structure of multiple deprivation in contemporary Ireland. Employing this approach, we identify 16 clusters characterised by distinct profiles across 42 deprivation indicators. Exploratory analyses demonstrate that, controlling for equivalised household income, SOM cluster membership adds substantially to our ability to predict subjective economic stress. Moreover, in comparison with an analogous latent class approach, the SOM analysis offers considerable additional discriminatory power in relation to individuals' experience of their economic circumstances. The results suggest that the SOM approach could prove a valuable addition to a `methodological platform' for analysing the shape and form of social exclusion. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Levanon, Asaf & Noah Lewin-Epstein. 2010. 'Grounds for Citizenship: Public Attitudes in Comparative Perspective.' Social Science Research. 39:3 419-431.	Social Science Research	2010	2	Information on the institutional arrangements of citizenship is increasingly available. However, we currently have only limited knowledge on the contours of public opinion towards citizenship. We seek to remedy this neglect by documenting patterns of support toward the most dominant citizenship principles: jus soli, jus sanguinis, and jus domicile. Specifically, we combine responses to questions on these principles to create a single measure of opinion toward citizenship law that encompasses three dominant citizenship approaches: assimilationist, exclusionary, and pluralist. Using data from the 2003 International Social Survey Program (ISSP) module on National Identity, we examine cross-national differences in support for the three approaches. Our results indicate that only two regime-types can clearly be identified - a pluralist regime, which centers on the importance of jus soli and includes traditional settler societies and Sweden, and an assimilationist regime, which is typified by its acceptance of jus domicile and includes the post-colonial empires of France and Britain. On the individual level, our analysis highlights the importance of perceptions of threat, either economically or culturally, in shaping public opinion toward citizenship. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Jackson, Margot, Anne Pebley & Noreen Goldman. 2010. 'Schooling Location and Economic, Occupational and Cognitive Success Among Immigrants and Their Children: the Case of Los Angeles.' Social Science Research. 39:3 432-443.	Social Science Research	2010	1	Large numbers of foreign-born residents in the United States mean that many people receive at least part of their education abroad. Despite this fact, our understanding of nativity differences in the success of adults and their children is based on research that does not empirically consider variation in the benefits to schooling depending on where it is received. We use data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey (L.A. FANS) to examine: (a) whether the socioeconomic and cognitive returns to education depend on whether it is received in the U.S. or abroad; and (b) whether schooling location partially accounts for nativity differences in these returns. We find that the returns to schooling are generally largest for adults who receive at least some of their highest level of education in the U.S. The beneficial effects of U.S. schooling are more pronounced at higher levels of educational attainment. Schooling location accounts for a sizeable fraction of the lower socioeconomic and cognitive returns of the foreign-born, relative to natives; some meaningful differences remain, however. In addition, the higher cognitive skills of the children of foreign-born adults remain unexplained. Although we cannot distinguish among the possible pathways underlying these associations (e.g., school quality, transferability of credentials, the timing of immigration) our findings suggest the importance of considering factors related to schooling location as predictors of socioeconomic and cognitive success in the United States.

Ueno, Koji. 2010. 'Patterns of Cross-orientation Friendships in High Schools.' Social Science Research. 39:3 444-458.	Social Science Research	2010	5	Previous studies indicate that school friendship networks of sexual minority students (students with non-heterosexual orientations) consist mostly of straight peers, but little is known about these straight friends. This paper examines what background characteristics predict straight students' chance of having sexual minority friends by analyzing friendship nomination data from two large high schools included in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Straight females are more likely than straight males to have cross-orientation friendships particularly with sexual minority males. Like friendships among straight students, cross-orientation friendships show a strong homophilous tendency-straight students choose sexual minority friends within their grade levels, racial groups, and academic aptitude levels. Beyond homophily, white race and high levels of academic aptitude and parent education increase straight students' chance of having sexual minority friends in some gender combinations, consistent with previous research showing the links between these backgrounds and positive attitudes toward sexual minorities.

Gasper, Joseph, Stefanie DeLuca & Angela Estacion. 2010. 'Coming and Going: Explaining the Effects of Residential and School Mobility on Adolescent Delinquency.' Social Science Research. 39:3 459-476.	Social Science Research	2010	11	Over the past half century, a large body of theoretical and empirical work in sociology and other social sciences has emphasized the negative consequences of mobility for human development in general, and youth outcomes in particular. In criminology, decades of research have documented a link between residential mobility and crime at both the macro and micro levels. At the micro level, mobility is associated with delinquency, substance use, and other deviant behaviors among adolescents. However, it is possible that the relationship between mobility and delinquency may be due to selection on pre-existing differences between mobile and non-mobile youth in their propensity for delinquency, and prior studies have not adequately addressed this issue. Specifically, the families that are most likely to move are also the most disadvantaged and may be characterized by dynamics and processes that are conducive to the development of delinquency and problem behavior in their children. This study uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 to assess the impact of residential and school mobility between the ages of 12 and 17 on delinquency and substance use. Random effects models control for selection on both observed and unobserved differences. Results show that mobility and delinquency are indeed spuriously related. Implications for future research on mobility and outcomes are discussed. (c) 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.	3	Joseph Gasper; Stefanie DeLuca; Angela Estacion

Social Science Research	2010	0	This paper examines how the military drawdown in the early 1990s influenced aggregate trends in employment and college enrollment, evaluating whether the loss of military jobs resulted in observable increases or decreases in employment rates and/or college enrollment rates. Contrary to the expectation of worsening employment among black men in particular, the drawdown had little effect on employment. However, changes in military service did have a considerable impact on college enrollment among black men. The loss of military jobs was actually associated with substantial increases in college going; college enrollments among black men may have been as much as 10\% points lower had they served in the military at the same levels observed in the early 1980s.

Taylor, Marylee & Matthew Schroeder. 2010. 'the Impact of Hispanic Population Growth on the Outlook of African Americans.' Social Science Research. 39:3 491-505.	Social Science Research	2010	1	We know too little about the effects of immigration on black Americans. If prior research yields mixed evidence about immigration's consequences for the objective well-being of African Americans, it is silent about effects of immigration on blacks' subjective well-being. To fill that void, this paper assesses the impact of the expanding Hispanic population on black Americans from a social psychological perspective. We ask whether blacks' self-reported distress, social distrust, or attitudes toward Hispanics and immigrants are affected by the size of the local Hispanic population or by the percentage growth in local Hispanic residents. Answers come from responses of non-Hispanic black participants in the 1998-2002 General Social Surveys, linked to 1990 and 2000 census data. Contrary to pessimistic claims, most social psychological outcomes, including measures of economic distress, manifest no impact of local Hispanic numbers. The four exceptions, significant effects of local Hispanic population share or percentage growth evenly split in valence, underscore the complexity of recent immigration's effects on African Americans.

The instrumental variables (IV) approach to this problem has proven difficult due to the problem of locating instruments for police levels. Using panel data from over 5000 cities (1990-2001), we instrumented police levels with two types of federal law enforcement grants, thus yielding over-identified models. We also subjected our instruments to both relevance and validity testing, a step authors of similar studies have yet to take. We found fairly robust inverse associations between police levels and four index crime rates (homicide, robbery, assault, and burglary), but mainly in large cities. (c) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Turner, Jonathan. 2010. 'the Stratification of Emotions: Some Preliminary Generalizations.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:2 168-199.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	4	Like all valued resources, positive and negative emotions are unequally distributed in a society and constitute an important basis of social stratification. In this article, a general conceptual scheme and a more specific theory of emotions are employed to offer a preliminary explanation of the dynamics of emotional stratification. This theory attempts to explain which specific positive and negative emotions will be aroused and distributed across the social class system as well as among members of differentially evaluated social categories. The theory emphasizes the importance of repression and subsequent attribution processes as central to understanding the nature, intensity, and distribution of negative emotions among individuals in lower social classes and devalued social categories. By viewing emotions as not just reactions to the unequal distribution of other resources but, rather, as a valued or punishing resource in their own right, it becomes possible to better understand how micro-level dynamics occurring in face-to-face encounters are affected by, and have effects on, meso-level and macro-level social structures and their respective cultures. In particular, the distribution of emotions can help account for both the processes of legitimatization of macrostructures and, at the same time, de-legitimization of, and collective action against, macrostructures. This analysis of emotions questions much recent theorizing and commentary, often within postmodern analysis, about the authenticity of people's emotions in contemporary society. The stratification of emotions is as real as inequality in money and power, and it has significant effects on the dynamics of human societies.	1	Jonathan H. Turner
Han, Sam. 2010. 'Theorizing New Media: Reflexivity, Knowledge, and the Web 2.0.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:2 200-213.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	2	A recent wave of popular and scholarly discourse has hailed the arrival of the Web 2.0, marking a new generation of Internet users who share and collaborate on popular social networking sites such as MySpace and user-generated communities such as YouTube and Wikipedia. Social and cultural critics have attempted to take stock of the implications of these various technological changes with specific emphasis on the state of knowledge in contemporary society. This article aims to theoretically examine knowledge in the context of new media technologies with particular attention paid to the notion of ``reflexivity.'' Focusing on the work of Scott Lash, whose theory of reflexivity radically differs from various other interpretations, I suggest that knowledge, in its modern formulation-as reasoned, stable, and linear-must be rethought for the information age, critiquing some of the predominant scholarly and popular media criticisms that suggests media to be mere enhancements of human forms of communication, knowledge, and sense-making. I conclude by considering some of the ontological dimensions of the transformations in the dynamics of knowledge in new media technologies.	1	Sam Han

Sociological Inquiry	2010	0	Examples drawn from the history of DNA profiling in the United States are used to show how knowledge claims about DNA profiling became part of the wider social structure. A crucial aspect of this process was the formation of new social structures at the micro and macro levels. Social order and knowledge formed within a community of practice, the FBI sponsored Technical Working Group on DNA Methods (TWGDAM), was translated and entrenched in new formal social structures, such as the DNA Identification Act of 1994. This in turn gave further stability and credibility to the knowledge about DNA profiling advanced by TWGDAM, as well as their status as a credible professional organization. This article contributes an understanding of the role that new social structures play in linking the micro and the macro levels of social structure.	1	Linda Derksen
Turner, Bryan. 2010. 'Enclosures, Enclaves, and Entrapment.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:2 241-260.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	4	The article takes a position against recent theories of globalization and mobility by arguing that there are important trends toward increased immobility. Whereas goods travel relatively freely in a global market, the same cannot be said for people. Various forms of immobility are explored through the key notion of enclaves. While ghettoes and wall building have been traditional aspects of the enclosure of people, the article argues that new biological technologies offer enhanced methods of tracking and containing people. The principal cause behind these developments is a greater emphasis on securitization by the state and hence globalization theories are criticized insofar as they propose that state borders have become more porous.	1	Bryan S.

el-Ojeili, Chamsy. 2010. 'Post-marxist Trajectories: Diagnosis, Criticism, Utopia.' Sociological Inquiry. 80:2 261-282.	Sociological Inquiry	2010	0	In this article, I examine the troublesome notion of ``post-Marxism.'' First, I read post-Marxism as an expression of the transformations entailed by our post-1968 entry into what world-systems thinkers call ``an age of transition.'' Second, drawing on Tormey and Townshend's work, I explore the thematic unity of post-Marxism in terms of six problems posed to Marxism-the problems of history, revolutionary subjectivity, ethics, positivism, vanguardism, and democracy. Third, I suggest that, given the many questions raised by post-Marxist efforts to go beyond these problems, and given the passing of the phase of what Holmes has called ``happy globalization,'' serious doubts are raised about the theoretical and utopian gains achieved by post-Marxism and the distance we might want to travel from the suggestions offered by the Marxian tradition.	1	Chamsy el-Ojeili

Sociological Inquiry	2010	1	The collective display of particular symbols represents an emergent form of social movement participation. This study documents the patterns of the collective display of one such symbol; the magnetic war-related ribbon (WRR). Using bivariate and multivariate analyses of a sample of 8,100 vehicles, we studied the relationships between WRR display and measures of political affiliation, patriotism, and war support. The results find that that WRR display is positively associated with affiliation with George W. Bush and the Republican Party, and various displays of patriotism and war support. This study demonstrates how advents in communication technologies, shifts in the social, economic, and political structures have converged and given rise to a new form of symbolic participation marked by the collective display of cause-related symbols.	4	Terry G.

Identification conditions are given for controlled direct effects and for natural direct and indirect effects. The interpretation of these identification conditions are discussed within the context of neighborhood research and multilevel modeling.

Despite a heightened interest in using visuals in research, efforts toward a more unified conceptual and methodological framework for dealing vigilantly with the specifics of this (relatively) new way of scholarly thinking and doing remain sparse and limited in scope. In this article, the author proposes a more encompassing and refined analytical framework for visual methods of research. The ``Integrated Framework'' tries to account for the great variety within each of the currently discerned types or methods. It does so by moving beyond the more or less arbitrary and often very hybridly defined modes and techniques, with a clear focus on what connects or transcends them. The second part of the article discusses a number of critical issues that have been raised while unfolding the framework. These issues continue to pose a challenge to a more visual social science, but can be turned into opportunities for advancement when dealt with appropriately.	1	Luc Pauwels

Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	9	The value of multiple informant methodology for improving the validity in determining organizational properties has been increasingly recognized. However, the majority of empirical research still relies on single (key) informants. This is partly due to the lack of comprehensive methodological narratives and precise recommendations on the application of this important methodology. Therefore, the authors have developed a critical review and derived clear recommendations for the key challenges that researchers face in using multiple informants: (1) Which and how many informants should be considered? (2) How should the consensus among the informants be judged? (3) How are multiple responses combined into a single, organizational response to conduct further data analyses?	3	Stephan M.

Sociological Methods \& Research. 38:4 619-651.	Sociological Methods \& Research	2010	3	This article extends the Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition method to the decomposition of changes in the wage gap between white and black men over time. The previously implemented technique, in which the contributions of two decomposition components are estimated by subtracting those at time 0 from the corresponding ones at time 1, can yield an untenable conclusion about the extent to which the contributions of the coefficient and endowment effects account for changes in the wage gap over time. This article presents a modified version of Smith and Welch's (1989) decomposition method through which the sources of the change over time are decomposed into five components. The extents to which the education, age, region, metro residence, and marital status variables contribute to the rising racial wage gap between white and black men from 1980 to 2005 are estimated using the five-component detailed decomposition method and are contrasted with the results of the old simple subtraction decomposition technique. In conclusion, this article shows that changes in the racial wage gap between 1980 and 2005 result from many contradicting forces and cannot be reduced to one explanation.	1	ChangHwan Kim

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	6	Recent critiques of depression have contested its coherence as a concept and highlighted its performance in medicalising distress. Studies of depression in a cross-cultural context have focused on language and belief systems as technical barriers to practice that need to be overcome in enacting depression work. This paper seeks to locate culture within the broader socio-structural context of depression care in general practice. The paper draws on interviews with five general practitioners (GPs), and 24 patients from Vietnamese and East Timorese backgrounds who predominantly have left their home as refugees. Each had been diagnosed with depression or prescribed antidepressants. These patients gave accounts of distress deeply embedded within, and inseparable from, lives fraught with frightening pre-migration experiences, traumatic escape and profound dislocation and alienation in their new `home'. Fragmented lives were contrasted with the nourishing social fabric of homes left behind. GP participants were involved in a process of engaging with a profoundly communal and structural account of emotional distress while defending and drawing on an individualised notion of depression in performing their work and accounting for the pain presented to them.	6	Renata Kokanovic; Carl May; Christopher Dowrick; John Furler; Danielle Newton; Jane Gunn

Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	1	This qualitative study examines the pre- and post-migration practice experiences of 73 physicians trained in South Africa who have relocated to Canada. The aims are to explore the workings of two different healthcare systems from an insider standpoint and to address the medical autonomy debate as it relates to international medical graduates (IMGs). While study respondents reported practice frustrations in both countries, they generally preferred working in a socialised health insurance environment that grants wider accessibility than a two-tiered system that favours a privileged few. Concerns such as family safety and opportunities for children also contributed to more satisfaction with Canada. We discuss our findings in relation to a broader international context and the sociological literature on medical autonomy. We argue that IMGs face different autonomy issues from other physicians and stress the need to broaden sociological inquiry of medical work by investigating how autonomy interfaces with other neglected aspects of physicians' work and non-work lives.	2	Ronald Joudrey; Krista Robson

In New Zealand, clinical priority assessment criteria (CPAC) tools have been developed to make access to elective surgery more equitable and efficient. Research was undertaken to identify how surgeons used these tools in the consultation. Forty-seven consultations with 15 different surgeons have to date been video- and audio-recorded. There were no instances where CPAC tools were explicitly used in the consultation. Drawing on the methodology of conversation analysis and the concept of news delivery as developed by Maynard, this paper argues that the delivery of diagnoses and treatment plans can usefully be seen in part as the delivery of bad or good news. Using three case studies to illustrate the argument, it is suggested that the interactional work required in the delivery of such news challenges the ability of clinicians to use protocols such as CPAC. The analysis sheds light on important consultation processes that need to be more carefully considered when designing interventions to influence clinician behaviour. In order to influence the behaviour of clinicians to achieve policy goals, greater attention needs to be paid to the interactional demands of the consultation process.	5	Kevin Dew; Maria Stubbe; Lindsay Macdonald; Anthony Dowell; Elizabeth Plumridge
Johansson, Karin, Margareta Lilja, Melissa Park & Staffan Josephsson. 2010. 'Balancing the Good - a Critical Discourse Analysis of Home Modification Services.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:4 563-582.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	0	Today an increasing number of people with functional limitations are ageing in their homes. Although the home has become an arena for assessment and implementation of services, little is known about how the interrelationships between ideological and practical circumstances influence the allocation of such welfare services. This explorative study applied a combination of critical discourse analysis and a narrative approach to closely examine such relationships in home modification services to older persons in Sweden. Data consisted of focus group discussions with street-level bureaucrats from two institutional contexts in the organisational field of home modification services and official documents related to such services. Findings showed that the attempts of street-level bureaucrats to allocate resources in accordance with the good were complicated by competing local definitions of `the good'. The process of forming local perceptions of the good included complex balancing acts between hegemonic discourses within the organisational field which influenced and shaped how `the good' was practised. Understanding the moral dimensions that enter into the complexity of allocation of home modification services across institutional settings has implications for the policies of and practices for the allocation of welfare resources.	4	Karin Johansson; Margareta Lilja; Melissa Park; Staffan Josephsson

Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:4 583-596.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	8	To further understand men's continued smoking during their partner's pregnancy and the postpartum period, a study was undertaken to explore women's perspectives of men's smoking. Using a gender lens, a thematic analysis of transcribed interviews with 27 women was completed. Women's constructions of men's smoking and linkages to masculine and feminine ideals are described. The findings highlight the ways women position themselves both as defenders and regulators of men's smoking. Femininities that aligned women with hegemonic masculine principles underpinned their roles in relation to men's smoking and presented challenges in influencing their partner's tobacco reduction. By positioning the decision to quit smoking as a man's solitary pursuit, women reduced potential relationship conflict and managed to maintain their identity as a supportive partner. Insights from this study provide direction for developing gender-specific tobacco reduction initiatives targeting expectant and new fathers. Indeed, a lack of intervention aimed at encouraging men's tobacco reduction has the potential to increase relationship tensions, and inadvertently maintain pressure on women to regulate fathers' smoking. This study illustrates how gender-based analyses can provide new directions for men's health promotion programmes and policies.	7	Joan L. Bottorff; John L. Oliffe; Mary T.

Fair, Brian. 2010. 'Morgellons: Contested Illness, Diagnostic Compromise and Medicalisation.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:4 597-612.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	4	The case of Morgellons illustrates how the emergence of a new medically contested illness intersected with and impacted on the diagnostic processes of an existing uncontested psychiatric condition, Delusional Parasitosis (DP). More specifically, the sociopolitical processes at play in the contested illness, Morgellons, dubiously reflect patient empowerment, as well the resilience and power of medical jurisdiction. This research offers insights into the contested illness and medicalisation literatures, and aims to bridge these two approaches towards the relationship between patient empowerment and medical authority, which I do through the notion of doctor-patient compromise. The data for this research come from a comprehensive qualitative analysis of Morgellons discourse through four key sources: the pro-Morgellons website Morgellons.org; the anti-Morgellons website Morgellonswatch.com; the popular media's portrayal of Morgellons; and the DP and Morgellons articles published in peer-reviewed medical journals, as made available on PubMed.	1	Brian Fair
Carpenter, Laura. 2010. 'on Remedicalisation: Male Circumcision in the United States and Great Britain.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:4 613-630.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	3	This paper compares the histories of male circumcision in the United States and Great Britain to explicate the theoretically important, yet inadequately specified, processes of demedicalisation and remedicalisation. Circumcision became medicalised to a similar extent, through similar processes, in both countries before World War II. However, by the 1960s, circumcision was almost completely demedicalised in Britain and almost universal in the US, where it became partially demedicalised after the 1970s. Medical professionals and insurance/healthcare systems drove demedicalisation in both countries; in the US, grassroots activists also played a critical role, while medical community `holdovers' and parents resisted demedicalisation. Recent research linking circumcision to HIV prevention and deaths following religious circumcision are differentially likely to produce remedicalisation in the two nations, given differences in circumcision prevalence, HIV epidemiology, insurance/health systems, activism opportunities, and status of religious groups. Research on (de/re)medicalisation should theorise the life cycle of medicalisation, explore comparative cases, and attend more closely to medical holdovers from previous eras, prevalence and duration of medicalised practices, and barriers to promoting non-medical interpretations.	1	Laura M.

Bell, Ann. 2010. 'Beyond (financial) Accessibility: Inequalities Within the Medicalisation of Infertility.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:4 631-646.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	3	There is a significant class disparity within the provision of medical treatments for infertility in the United States. Common explanations attribute this inequality to financial inaccessibility due to sparse insurance coverage and exorbitant costs. However, little is known as to why disparities still exist without the presence of such constraints, such as in states with comprehensive insurance coverage of infertility treatments. Drawing on in-depth interviews with women of low socioeconomic status (SES), this paper aims to explore the structural and political barriers to receiving medical care for infertility within the United States context. The paper argues that much of the invisible, unidentified treatment disparities of infertility stem from the social control mechanism of medicalisation. Medicalisation perpetuates the stratified system of reproduction through its structural inaccessibility and the institutionalised classism apparent within medicine's reproductive health practices and policies. The women in this study, however, actively and creatively identified ways to overcome the reproductive limits with which they were faced. In doing so, their solutions served both to accept and reject dominant norms of motherhood and medicine.	1	Ann V. Bell
Thomas, Carol. 2010. 'Negotiating the Contested Terrain of Narrative Methods in Illness Contexts.' Sociology of Health \& Illness. 32:4 647-660.	Sociology of Health \& Illness	2010	7	This paper offers an interpretive account of an ongoing transatlantic debate about illness narratives instigated by the publication in 1997 of Paul Atkinson's paper Narrative Turn Or Blind Alley? The claims and counter-claims to be found in this debate about narrative data and narrative analysis are set out sequentially, in an attempt to grasp the debate's essentials. Matters of theoretical perspective, methodology, ethics, and personal politics are found to be at stake in the writings of the four featured academics: Paul Atkinson, Arthur Bochner, Arthur Frank and Elliot Mishler. The paper moves on to consider the types of sociologies at work in their arguments, and explores the debate's implications for the author's own illness narratives research project. The paper's overall aim is to assist researchers who seek to clarify their own thinking on the use of narrative research methods in illness contexts.	1	Carol Thomas
Hanagan, Michael & Chris Tilly. 2010. 'Cities, States, Trust, and Rule: New Departures From the Work of Charles Tilly.' Theory and Society. 39:3-4, SI 245-263.	Theory and Society	2010	0	In the light of his essay ``Cities, States and Trust Networks,'' contributors to this collection were asked to consider ways of building on or departing from the late Charles Tilly's work. The authors in this collection addressed four major themes: (1) historicism and historical legacies, (2) trust networks and commitment, (3) city-state relations, and (4) democracy and inequality. Authors concentrating on historicism examined how, despite unanticipated consequences, social action nonetheless produced systematic, durable, social structures; they particularly focused on processes of identity formation and cultural reproduction. In regard to trust networks, contributors discovered a striking variety of forms and relationships and they investigated their origins and their relationship to institutions and culture. Looking at city-state relations, authors uncovered the richness and intricacy of the ties linking cities and states and showed that city-state relations were important not simply in terms of the autonomy or dependence of mutual ties, but also in the quality of these relationships. Besides the ties between cities and states other authors sought to focus on empires and wondered about the degree to which empire formation involved similar processes as state formation. Several authors developed this theme. Authors pursuing themes of democracy and inequality stressed how changes in citizenship and the expansion of parliamentary democratic forms might have complicated effects. The relationship between democracy and inequality was mediated by elites and institutions. Democracy constrained inequality but inequality also constrained democracy. Increased state capacity might enable states to remedy old inequities but it might also allow them to perpetrate new ones. The authors' varied responses suggest promising directions for research on cities, states, and trust networks.	2	Michael Hanagan; Chris Tilly

Theory and Society	2010	5	An introduction to a vast but uncompleted survey of world history, this article argues that the study of the changing relationships among cities, states and trust networks can help us understand key elements of the emergence of our modern world. Beginning in ancient Uruk in modern-day Iraq, roughly five thousand years ago, the essay defines each of its central categories: city, state and trust network. It poses four questions to be pursued throughout the rest of the study. What determines the degree of segregation or integration of cities and states? What determines the relative dominance of cities and states? What determines the extent of separation or integration between cities or states, on one side, and trust networks on the other? What difference do these variable configurations make to the quality of ordinary people's lives?.	1	Charles Tilly
Linden, Marcel. 2010. 'Unanticipated Consequences of ``humanitarian Intervention'': the British Campaign to Abolish the Slave Trade, 1807-1900.' Theory and Society. 39:3-4, SI 281-298.	Theory and Society	2010	1	Building on Robert Merton's theory of unanticipated consequences of purposive action and Charles Tilly's theory of error correction, the present article presents a stylized narrative about the British campaign to abolish the trading in African slaves, from its beginning in 1807 until the end of the nineteenth century. In the end, this campaign was largely successful, though it required error corrections that had extremely far-reaching consequences. The colonization of Africa was, to a certain extent, a second-degree unanticipated consequence. This case study suggests that three sorts of error correction can be distinguished, namely (a) measures that are taken to facilitate the effective implementation of the purposive action; (b) measures that are taken to minimize unintended consequences, after the purposive action has been carried out; and (c) new purposive actions that widen the objective and are more far-reaching than the original purposive action.	1	Marcel Linden

Theory and Society. 39:3-4, SI 299-313.	Theory and Society	2010	0	This article asks how state formation processes informed the normative frameworks of late-Medieval and early-Modern Latin European and Muslim Middle Eastern regimes. The question at hand is not why pre-Modern regimes discriminated against religious minorities (as well as other groups) during the pre-Modern period, but why Western European states consistently engaged in mass expulsions of their non-Christian subjects from the late thirteenth century onward and the neighboring states of the Middle East did not. Rather than addressing these peculiar policies as a function of religion, culture, or law the article adopts a comparative, contextual method. With the aid of Charles Tilly's theoretical perspectives it isolates critical variables in pre-Modern Middle Eastern state formation. These variables are then used to shed light on the circumstances and relationships that led to Latin Europe's mass expulsions of Jews and Muslims between 1290 and 1614.	1	Ariel Salzmann

This article looks at how the migrants moving to these emerging cities melded into communities and defended their collective rights in violent and hostile environments. It discusses a number of trust networks that were developed to meet the successive collective needs of particular social layers in rapidly changing urban societies. When a trust network became well-established and too large to allow face-to-face relations among all its members, institutions were created that operated under different rules.	1	Wim Blockmans
Shin, Hwaji. 2010. 'Colonial Legacy of Ethno-racial Inequality in Japan.' Theory and Society. 39:3-4, SI 327-342.	Theory and Society	2010	1	This essay challenges anti-historicist accounts that sever the link between the colonial past and present, replacing them with a more historically nuanced understanding of Japan's immigration policies and their relation to ethno-racial inequality. Contrary to the dominant view that transnational immigration is new to Japan, this article shows that Japan already had a history of immigration in the early twentieth century, and this history generated a lasting impact on postwar immigration policies and their integration. While recognizing the impact of structural and individual factors, this essay underscores a path-dependent approach that demonstrates how colonial exclusion led to the formation of a durable structure of inequality against low skilled labor immigrants, and thus how such a colonial legacy has continued to limit the life chances and integration of subsequent immigrants in Japan since the 1980s.	1	Hwaji Shin
Centeno, Miguel & Elaine Enriquez. 2010. 'Legacies of Empire?.' Theory and Society. 39:3-4, SI 343-360.	Theory and Society	2010	0	Using methods and themes from Charles Tilly's work, this paper presents a number of propositions related to empire-to-state transformation. We argue that variations in national state development from imperial metropole origins can be explained, at least in part, by variations in imperial administration, finance, development, identity, and inequality. Capacity is a critical determinant of the results of state transformation, while decisions about finance and investment are both economic and political. Identity and inequality are inextricably linked to empire, and our exploration of these concepts demonstrates that they are the outcomes of variable processes linked to concrete, if inadvertent, lines of imperial decisions.	2	Miguel Angel Centeno; Elaine Enriquez
Soja, Edward. 2010. 'Cities and States in Geohistory.' Theory and Society. 39:3-4, SI 361-376.	Theory and Society	2010	3	In his last major work, Charles Tilly presents a schematic history of the development of cities, states, and trust networks over the past five millennia. I reconfigure his ``look across history'' from a more assertively spatial perspective, pushing back the starting point of the geohistory of cities another 5,000 years to what is presented as the first of three ``urban revolutions.'' From this geohistorical viewpoint, cities and states do not emerge together de novo in Sumeria but the state is seen as being generated from earlier urbanization processes or what can be described as the stimulus of urban agglomeration. The generative power of cities or urban spatial causality, rarely addressed in the social science literature, is being re-discovered today as a primary source of societal development, technological innovation, and cultural creativity. In my schematic geohistory, the stimulus of urban agglomeration is traced over 10,000 years from its early role in the development of full-scale agriculture and the remarkable artistic creativity emanating from Catalhoyuk, the largest of the earliest urban settlements; through the formation of politically charged city-states and city-based empires; to the city-generated Industrial Revolution and the origins of urban industrial capitalism; ending in a look at the contemporary reconfiguration of cities and states and the shift from metropolitan to regional urbanization.	1	Edward W.

Clemens, Elisabeth. 2010. 'From City Club to Nation State: Business Networks in American Political Development.' Theory and Society. 39:3-4, SI 377-396.	Theory and Society	2010	0	Although cities were given no role in the constitutional order of the United States, the new nation posed the same potential threats to the accumulation of capital and wealth as European monarchs posed to long-powerful urban centers. In mobilizing for self-protection and advancement, American business developed new practices and discourses of citizenship that sustained a central role for the community as the locus of social provision. The strategy combined opportunity-hoarding through restricted membership in civic groups and obligation-hoarding through the alignment of diverse networks of voluntarism with this civic core. The linkage of business interests to this hybrid charitable-civic configuration constituted a source of resistance to nationalizing tendencies driven by demands for social protection. This alternative model of social provision and civic organization sustained a distinctive pattern of political membership and state development. By fiercely defending the capacity of privately governed civic networks to provide substantial social support, this history of business influence through community organizations lives on in the partial and fragmented character of the American welfare state.	1	Elisabeth S.

Davis, Diane. 2010. 'Irregular Armed Forces, Shifting Patterns of Commitment, and Fragmented Sovereignty in the Developing World.' Theory and Society. 39:3-4, SI 397-413.	Theory and Society	2010	4	Historically, the study of state formation has involved a focus on the urban and national conditions under which states monopolize the means of coercion, generate legitimacy, and marshal sufficient economic resources to wage war against enemies while sustaining citizen allegiance through the extension of social programs, new forms of national solidarity, and citizenship. In Charles Tilly's large body of work, these themes loomed large, and they have re-emerged in slightly reformulated ways in an unfinished manuscript that reflected on the relationship between capital and coercion in which he also integrated the element of commitment-or networks of trust-into the study of state formation. This article develops these same ideas but in new directions, casting them in light of contemporary rather than historical developments. Taking as its point of departure the accelerating rates of criminal violence and citizen insecurity in cities of the developing world, this essay suggests that random and targeted violence increasingly perpetrated by ``irregular'' armed forces pose a direct challenge to state legitimacy and national sovereignty. Through examination of urban and transnational non-state armed actors who use violence to accumulate capital and secure economic dominion, and whose activities reveal alternative networks of commitment, power, authority, and even self-governance, this essay identifies contemporary parallels with the pre-modern period studied by Charles Tilly, arguing that current patterns challenge prevailing national-state forms of sovereignty. Drawing evidence primarily from Mexico and other middle income developing countries that face growing insecurity and armed violence, the article examines the new ``spatialities'' of irregular armed force, how they form the basis for alternative networks of coercion, allegiance, and reciprocity that challenge old forms and scales of sovereignty, and what this means for the power and legitimacy of the traditional nation-state.	1	Diane E.

Gallo, Carmenza. 2010. 'Institutions and the Adoption of Rights: Political and Property Rights in Colombia.' Theory and Society. 39:3-4, SI 415-431.	Theory and Society	2010	0	Citizenship rights are the result of specific political bargains between different collective actors and state authorities (Tilly Theory and Society 26(34):599-602, 1997). The political bargains for rights are encoded in institutions, and these institutions develop independently from each other and take organizational characteristics that make certain rights easier to adopt than others. I argue that these institutions vary along two dimensions that affect the extent to which states can adopt rights successfully: one dimension is distributional and the second is the depth or extension of the rules that frame a given right. This article focuses on the institutional differences between property rights, especially land property, and political rights, and on the consequences of those differences on their adoption. I then illustrate my argument with examples from Colombia since 1980.	1	Carmenza Gallo

Theory and Society	2010	3	Drawing on Charles Tilly's work on inequality, democracy and cities, we explore the local level dynamics of democratization across urban settings in India, South Africa, and Brazil. In all three cases, democratic institutions are consolidated, but there is tremendous variation in the quality of the democratic relationship between cities and their citizens. We follow Tilly's focus on citizenship as the key element in democratization and argue that explaining variance across our three cases calls for analyzing patterns of inequality through the kind of relational lens used by Tilly and recognizing that patterns of contestation are shaped by shifting political relationships between the nation and the city. We conclude that Tilly's theoretical frame is nicely sustained by the comparative analysis of cases very different from those that stimulated his original formulations.	2	Patrick Heller; Peter Evans
Srinivas, Smita. 2010. 'Industrial Welfare and the State: Nation and City Reconsidered.' Theory and Society. 39:3-4, SI 451-470.	Theory and Society	2010	0	Industrial welfare history presents important challenges to developmental state theories in ``late'' industrialization. This article expands the debate by examining how nation-states create statutory welfare by addressing institutional variety beyond markets. It is simplistic to argue linear growth of national welfare or of states autonomously regulating markets to achieve risk-mitigation. I contend that welfare institutions emerge from the state's essential conflict and collaboration with various alternate institutions in cities and regions. Using histories of Europe, India, and Karnataka, I propose a place-based, work-based, and work-place based welfare typology evolving at differential rates. Although economic imperatives exist to expand local risk-pools, it is precisely the alternate institutional diversity that makes late industrial nation-states unable or unwilling to do so. This results in institutionally ``thin,'' top-down industrial welfare. Ultimately, theories that overly depend on histories of small nations, homogenous nations, or city-states, provide weak tests of the economics of industrial welfare.	1	Smita Srinivas
Marcuse, Peter. 2010. 'the Forms of Power and the Forms of Cities: Building on Charles Tilly.' Theory and Society. 39:3-4, SI 471-485.	Theory and Society	2010	0	Chuck Tilly's late work on coercion, capital, and trust is provocative when applied to changes in urban form. Extending those categories for use in tracing the history of conflicts in cities about how development should be handled highlights the changing roles of economic and physical and cultural power, and the growing importance of trust in these processes. This is a speculative article with a political hope. The speculation is around the potential of using an expanded version of key categories of Charles Tilly's to create a framework for understanding the nature of change in the form of cities over time. The political hope is to use that framework to illuminate the possibilities of social change in cities today in the direction of social justice.	1	Peter Marcuse

Theory and Society	2010	2	This article attempts to resolve a contradiction noted by Charles Tilly between my earlier writings on education and later writings on the welfare state. The earlier work on education was critical of governments' role in constructing bureaucratic school systems that reinforced inequality; the later work on the welfare state argued for the extension of government social provision. This article shows how the contradiction poses a false dichotomy. It then uses history to show how assessments of governments' role reflect the political context in which they are written but rest on consistent values and priorities. The article emphasizes, as well, the absence of a counter narrative to the political right's assertion of government policy failure; the truncated and inappropriate use of ``state'' in much writing on public policies; and the need for historians of policy to develop means of assessing the success or failure of government policies and programs.	1	Michael B.

Work and Occupations. 37:2 119-161.	Work and Occupations	2010	1	This study defines four sectors of labor markets based on union membership and public-sector employment. Using the current population surveys from 1983 to 2005, the authors decompose the growth of wage inequality into compositional changes, group-specific mean changes, and group-specific variance changes. This approach allows one to more precisely identify and assess the immediate intervening processes associated with rising wage inequality. The findings suggest that, although the increase of the demand for the skilled workers does play a significant role, the recent increase in wage dispersion cannot be fully explained by skill-biased technological change. This study's analysis instead indicates that the two main sources of increasing inequality include the ``nonunion private sectorization'' of all sectors and the reduction in the sizes of the institutionally protected market sectors. Rising inequality seems to be because of the dismantling of the institutions that formerly insulated a large proportion of workers from direct engagement with market forces as the immediate wage-setting mechanism.	2	ChangHwan Kim; Arthur Sakamoto

Work and Occupations	2010	6	In this article, a relational model of inequality is applied to understand organizational wage inequality patterns. The authors begin by laying out a relational model arguing that wage distributions emerge from actors within workplaces negotiating and contesting who should receive greater or lesser rewards for their work. These claims typically involve constructing categorical distinctions between people and jobs, attaching meaning to those categories, and actors in those categories attempting to exploit value and hoard opportunities through a process of claims making. Using the Australian National Organizations Study, the influence of relational differences between jobs on wage inequalities is modeled. It was found that jobs comprising actors with higher status and greater power in the labor process are often able to use their status and power relative to others to extract greater rewards, generating wage inequality between jobs. The effects of these relational status and labor process distinctions vary across institutional and market contexts, suggesting that the relational model is enhanced by contextualizing this generic process. The article concludes by identifying how future research might further specify a relational model of the generation of inequality.	2	Dustin Avent-Holt; Donald Tomaskovic-Devey

Work and Occupations	2010	8	This study revisits the relationship between adolescent judgments about work and later job characteristics, tackling the twin temporal dimensions of age and history. Drawing on 15 consecutive cohorts of high school seniors, the authors examine (a) whether adolescents' judgments about work become more strongly predictive of the characteristics of their jobs as they move through their 20s and (b) whether the relationship between adolescents' judgments about work and their later job characteristics has weakened across cohorts of high school seniors between 1976 and 1990. Findings indicate a limited role of history; the larger life course story of these findings is tied to age. Adolescent judgments about work, measured in the senior year of high school, became more predictive of earnings with age during this period of the life course. They were also most predictive of the level of intrinsic job characteristics at the oldest age examined, but the pattern was not one of progressive strengthening with age as it was for earnings.	2	Monica Kirkpatrick Johnson; Maria A.

American Sociological Review. 75:2 185-204.	American Sociological Review	2010	1	We examine Democrats' decline in the House of Representatives from the mid-1930s to the late 1940s. Debates over American exceptionalism in the realm of social policy pay surprisingly little attention to a profound transformation that occurred during and after World War II: on the international stage, the United States emerged as the hegemon; at home, the Pentagon became the largest and most powerful agency in the federal bureaucracy. In modeling electoral losses suffered by Democrats, we show that World War II mobilization played an important role. First, Democrats lost ground in congressional districts where the nascent military-industrial complex was created, specifically in aircraft manufacturing centers. Second, the impact of aircraft manufacturing intersected with wartime in-migration of non-whites. Democrats suffered significantly greater losses where both non-white population and aircraft manufacturing employment increased. Our findings corroborate accounts of the social welfare state that stress partisan control and path dependence. Conservative congresses of the immediate postwar years left an imposing legacy, making it difficult to establish social welfare reforms for decades to come. Whereas most accounts of the rise and fall of the New Deal emphasize different aspects of domestic processes, we demonstrate that militarism and expansion of national security agencies undermined congressional support at a critical juncture. This intersection of wartime mobilization and social policy-and not an inherent and enduring institutional impediment to social welfare-contributed to under-development of the welfare state and abandonment of universal social welfare programs in the United States.	2	Gregory Hooks; Brian McQueen

American Sociological Review	2010	3	This article investigates how experiences with public policies affect levels of civic and political engagement among the poor. Studies of `'policy feedback'' investigate policies not just as political outcomes, but also as factors that set political forces in motion and shape political agency. To advance this literature, we take up three outstanding questions related to selection bias, the distinction between universal and targeted programs, and the types of authority relations most likely to foster engagement among the poor. Using a longitudinal dataset from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study, which follows a cohort of low-income parents and their newborn children in 20 U.S. cities, we estimate effects associated with three types of means-tested public assistance. We find that these policies' effects are not an illusion created by selection bias; the effects of targeted programs can both promote and discourage engagement; and such effects tend to be more positive when a policy's authority structure reflects democratic rather than paternalist principles.	3	Sarah K.

American Sociological Review. 75:2 227-251.	American Sociological Review	2010	1	This article uses time-series data from 1900 to 2005 to explore the effects of rivalry between labor unions as a special case of inter-organizational competition. Holding constant economic and political factors that typically account for changes in union density, we investigate how competition from rival labor federations and from independent unions affect both union density and a measure for the density of the dominant federation (AFL/AFL-CIO), adjusted for membership changes from mergers and splits. We measure competition by the number of unions and the size of rivals. While much existing literature measures state regulation with categorical coding for specific periods, we measure the effect of state enforcement directly with counts of pro-labor and pro-management unfair labor practice cases adjudicated by the National Labor Relations Board. We assess the effect of left-wing political culture using the popular vote for socialist and communist candidates in presidential elections. Both the number of members in rival unions and the total number of rival unions positively impact the rate of change in overall union density and in AFL density. The size of independent unions has a negative impact on AFL/AFL-CIO density but no effect on overall union density. Unfair labor practices cases adjudicated for employers negatively affect union density but positively affect AFL/AFL-CIO density, while cases adjudicated for unions negatively affect AFL/AFL-CIO density.	2	Judith Stepan-Norris; Caleb Southworth
Maher, Thomas. 2010. 'Threat, Resistance, and Collective Action: the Cases of Sobibor, Treblinka, and Auschwitz.' American Sociological Review. 75:2 252-272.	American Sociological Review	2010	9	How and why do movements transition from everyday resistance to overt collective action? This article examines this question taking repressive environments and threat as an important case in point. Drawing on primary and secondary data sources, I offer comparative insights on resistance group dynamics and perceptions of threat in three Nazi death camps-Sobibor, Treblinka, and Auschwitz-between 1941 and 1945. Prisoners formed resistance groups at each camp, but collective revolt occurred in only certain cases: when the collective perception of threat at a given camp was viewed as both immediate and lethal. The interpretation of changing, threatening conditions, and an understanding of structural and interactional opportunities for group identity and tactical strategizing, are vital for understanding collective action in repressive environments. I conclude by discussing these lessons pertaining to threat and their implications for repressive contexts and broader social movement theorizing.	1	Thomas V. Maher
Brand, Jennie & Yu Xie. 2010. 'Who Benefits Most From College? Evidence for Negative Selection in Heterogeneous Economic Returns to Higher Education.' American Sociological Review. 75:2 273-302.	American Sociological Review	2010	29	In this article, we consider how the economic return to a college education varies across members of the U.S. population. Based on principles of comparative advantage, scholars commonly presume that positive selection is at work, that is, individuals who are most likely to select into college also benefit most from college. Net of observed economic and noneconomic factors influencing college attendance, we conjecture that individuals who are least likely to obtain a college education benefit the most from college. We call this theory the negative selection hypothesis. To adjudicate between the two hypotheses, we study the effects of completing college on earnings by propensity score strata using an innovative hierarchical linear model with data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 and the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study. For both cohorts, for both men and women, and for every observed stage of the life course, we find evidence suggesting negative selection. Results from auxiliary analyses lend further support to the negative selection hypothesis.	2	Jennie E. Brand; Yu Xie
Cha, Youngjoo. 2010. 'Reinforcing Separate Spheres: the Effect of Spousal Overwork on Men's and Women's Employment in Dual-earner Households.' American Sociological Review. 75:2 303-329.	American Sociological Review	2010	19	This study examines whether long work hours exacerbate gender inequality. As working long hours becomes increasingly common, a normative conception of gender that prioritizes men's careers over women's careers in dual-earner households may pressure women to quit their jobs. I apply multilevel models to longitudinal data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation to show that having a husband who works long hours significantly increases a woman's likelihood of quitting, whereas having a wife who works long hours does not appear to increase a man's likelihood of quitting. This gendered pattern is more prominent among workers in professional and managerial occupations, where the norm of overwork and the culture of intensive parenting are strong. Furthermore, the effect is stronger among workers who have children. Findings suggest that overwork can reintroduce the separate spheres arrangement, consisting of breadwinning men and homemaking women, to many formerly dual-earner households.	1	Youngjoo Cha
England, Paula. 2010. 'the Gender Revolution Uneven and Stalled.' Gender \& Society. 24:2 149-166.	Gender \& Society	2010	63	In this article, the author describes sweeping changes in the gender system and offers explanations for why change has been uneven. Because the devaluation of activities done by women has changed little, women have had strong incentive to enter male jobs, but men have had little incentive to take on female activities or jobs. The gender egalitarianism that gained traction was the notion that women should have access to upward mobility and to all areas of schooling and jobs. But persistent gender essentialism means that most people follow gender-typical paths except when upward mobility is impossible otherwise. Middle-class women entered managerial and professional jobs more than working-class women integrated blue-collar jobs because the latter were able to move up while choosing a ``female'' occupation; many mothers of middle-class women were already in the highest-status female occupations. The author also notes a number of gender-egalitarian trends that have stalled.	1	Paula England
Myers, Kristen & Laura Raymond. 2010. 'Elementary School Girls and Heteronormativity the Girl Project.' Gender \& Society. 24:2 167-188.	Gender \& Society	2010	2	This article examines preadolescent girls in a group setting as they coconstructed heteronormativity. The authors contend that heteronormativity is not the product of a coming-of-age transformation but instead an everyday part of life, even for very young social actors. It emerges from the gender divide between boys and girls but is also reproduced by and for girls themselves. In the Girl Project, the authors sought to understand younger girls' interests, skills, and concerns. They conducted nine focus groups with 43 elementary school girls, most of whom were age nine or younger. They observed these girls as they defined ``girls' interests'' as boy centered and as they performed heteronormativity for other girls. This article contributes to filling the gap in research on gender and sexuality from children's own points of view.	2	Kristen Myers; Laura Raymond
Taylor, Catherine. 2010. 'Occupational Sex Composition and the Gendered Availability of Workplace Support.' Gender \& Society. 24:2 189-212.	Gender \& Society	2010	12	This study examines how occupational sex segregation affects women's and men's perceptions of the availability of workplace support. Drawing on theories of gender and empirical studies of workplace tokenism, the author develops the concept of an occupational minority. Although the notion of tokenism was developed to describe processes at the level of the workplace, the author explores how being a minority at the occupational level affects workers. Using nationally representative data, she finds that in mixed-sex occupations, women report higher levels of workplace support than men; in male-dominated occupations, they perceive relatively low levels of support. Men, by contrast, perceive relatively high levels of workplace support in female-dominated occupations. That is, being a member of a numerical minority in one's occupation is an advantage for men and a disadvantage for women.	1	Catherine J. Taylor
Kmec, Julie, Steve McDonald & Lindsey Trimble. 2010. 'Making Gender Fit and ``correcting'' Gender Misfits Sex Segregated Employment and the Nonsearch Process.' Gender \& Society. 24:2 213-236.	Gender \& Society	2010	5	This article highlights the extent to which finding a job without actively searching (''nonsearching'') sustains workplace sex segregation. We suspect that unsolicited information from job informants that prompts fortuitous job changes is susceptible to bias about gender ``fit'' and segregates workers. Results from analyses of 1,119 respondents to the 1996 and 1998 waves of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth are generally consistent with this expectation. Gender ``misfits''-''individuals employed in gender-atypical work groups-are more likely to move into gender-typical work groups than neutral ones. Women misfits are more likely to move into male-dominated than neutral work groups without a job search, but they join mostly desegregated occupations and receive lower job rewards than men misfits who change jobs without searching. We conclude that the nonsearch process serves as an important mechanism that sustains sex segregation and workplace inequality.	3	Julie A. Kmec; Steve McDonald; Lindsey B. Trimble
De, Marina. 2010. 'Ways to Come, Ways to Leave Gender, Mobility, and Il/legality Among Ethiopian Domestic Workers in Yemen.' Gender \& Society. 24:2 237-260.	Gender \& Society	2010	1	Based on anthropological fieldwork in Yemen, this article examines the relationship between gender, mobility, and il/legality in the lives of Ethiopian domestic workers. Studies about migrant domestic workers in the Middle East often focus on abuse and exploitation, making a plea for the regulation of women's legal status. Yet legal migration does not automatically mean that women gain more rights and become more mobile; regulation may also entail more control. The relationship between method of entry and legal status is not fixed, and the boundaries between legality and illegality are often blurred, with women moving in and out of il/legality and legal organizations following illegal practices, and vice versa. Gendered state policies and practices also affect women's space for maneuvering, and attempts at regulation may further restrict rather than increase their mobility.	1	Marina De
Rajah, Valli. 2010. 'Intimacy, Time, and Scarcity: Drug-involved Women Account for Secretly Withholding Financial Capital in Violent Intimate Relationships.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 39:2 131-158.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	1	Research on the intimate relationships of drug-involved women has characterized these women either as passive victims of male violence and exploitation or as instrumental actors who maintain intimate relationships merely for the financial benefits they provide. This dichotomous depiction fails to capture the complexity of women's accounts of such intimate relationships. Drawing on in-depth interviews with a group of poor, inner-city, largely African American and Puerto Rican women with a history of drug addiction and violent intimate relationships, this article looks at the accounts women offer for secretly withholding financial capital from their partners. Taking a constructionist approach, it demonstrates that women account for their practices within a normative context of gender relations by withholding capital to address the changing financial needs of the couple over time. In so doing, women provide themselves with a needed sense of order and continuity, what Anthony Giddens calls ontological security. This article adds to our understanding of how drug-involved women's changing orientations to time may impact their constructions of their intimate relations. Implications for future research are discussed.	1	Valli Rajah

Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 39:2 159-186.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	1	This article reports an ethnographic study of drag queens who perform in Miami Beach. Drag queens are marginalized, both economically and socially. However, drag enables some gay men to emphasize and manipulate aspects of femininity for the means of earning attention and income and garnering situational power. Grounding their empirical findings in symbolic interaction, identity, and performance theories, the authors argue that drag queens employ nuanced strategies to negotiate their contradictory status of admired yet alienated performers. The authors use observational and in-depth interview data to explore how participants experience, cope with, and challenge their social marginality. The authors then detail the rewards of drag, focusing on the allure of the transformation, situational power, and income. A subjective understanding of drag reveals that although marginalization is a serious issue, the rewards of drag can be empowering. The authors argue that identity work emerges as a link between marginalization and rewards.	2	Dana Berkowitz; Linda Liska Belgrave

The article explores the socialization that takes place there to see how the tension between traditional and community policing is resolved. The authors found that despite the philosophical emphasis on community policing and its themes of decentralization and flexibility, the most salient lessons learned in police training were those that reinforced the paramilitary structure and culture.	2	Allison T.

Jennings, Patricia. 2010. '``god Had Something Else in Mind'': Family, Religion, and Infertility.' Journal of Contemporary Ethnography. 39:2 215-237.	Journal of Contemporary Ethnography	2010	0	Feminist scholarship has generated a large body of work that reveals that medical discourse encourages infertile women to embrace assisted reproductive technologies (ART) as a path to ``normative'' family formation. The role that religion plays in the decision-making process is absent from this body of scholarship. This study is part of a larger study on infertility. In this article, I explore how infertile women who profess some religious affinity utilize medicine and religion to achieve their reproductive goals. Findings, which are drawn from participant observation of RESOLVE meetings and face-to-face interviews with infertile women, suggest that religion intersects with gender in complex ways. For many of the women in this study, growing up in traditional ``church-going'' families coupled with their continued connection to mainstream religion reaffirmed their desire for a child-centered family. Most of the women in this study pursued some form of ART This held even for those who affiliated with religions that opposed ART (e.g., the Catholic Church). When ART failed, some women drew on religious discourse to renegotiate their views on adoption. For a small number of women, religious experience moved them to adopt ``hard to adopt'' children. I draw on these findings to suggest strategies for future research on religion and infertility.	1	Patricia K. Jennings

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	16	We use data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (N = 1,975) to examine the association between mothers' partnership changes and parenting behavior during the first 5 years of their children's lives. We compare coresidential with dating transitions and recent with more distal transitions. We also examine interactions between transitions and race/ethnicity, maternal education, and family structure at birth. Findings indicate that both coresidential and dating transitions were associated with higher levels of maternal stress and harsh parenting; recent transitions had stronger associations than distal transitions. Maternal education significantly moderated these associations, with less-educated mothers responding more negatively to instability in terms of maternal stress and more-educated mothers responding more negatively in terms of literacy activities.	4	Audrey N.

The positive association between mothers' union transitions and each outcome for White adolescents was attenuated by social protection. The association of instability with age at first sex and first nonmarital birth was weaker for Black adolescents but not for Mexican American adolescents. The weaker association was explained by Black adolescents' more frequent exposure to socioeconomic stress in the context of union instability.	3	Paula Fomby; Stefanie Mollborn; Christie A. Sennott

Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:2 254-266.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	4	Although triangulation into parental conflict is a risk factor for child and adolescent maladjustment, little is known about how triangulation affects adolescents' functioning or the factors that lead children to be drawn into parental disagreements. This prospective study examined the relations between triangulation, appraisals of conflict, and parent-child relations in a sample of 171 adolescents, ages 14 to 19 years, at 2 time points. Cross-lagged path analyses revealed that youths who experienced greater threat in response to conflict reported increases in triangulation over time, and triangulation was associated with increased self-blame and diminished parent-adolescent relations. This study highlights links between intrapersonal, dyadic, and triadic processes and suggests a mechanism by which interparental discord spills over into parent-adolescent relations.	2	Gregory M.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	2	Guided by research and theory on sibling similarities and differences, this study explored the nature and correlates of 2 processes of sibling influence-social learning and sibling differentiation-during adolescence. Participants included 2 adolescent-age siblings (M = 16.29 years for older siblings and M = 12.59 years for younger siblings, respectively) from 166 two-parent African American families. Significant nonlinear associations between these two influence dynamics and some sibling relationship qualities were discovered. For sibling differentiation, but not social learning, these links were further moderated by gender composition of the sibling dyad. Additional analyses revealed that youths' reports of social learning were generally linked to smaller differences between siblings, whereas differentiation processes were linked to greater differences in siblings' individual characteristics.	3	Shawn D.

Data were drawn from a longitudinal study of a community sample (N = 585). Parental marital conflict and divorce were measured from age 5 through age 17 years. Mother-child and father-child relationship quality at age 22 years was assessed in terms of closeness-support and conflict-control. Results indicated that both marital conflict and divorce are associated with poorer quality parent - adult child relationships. Divorce moderated the link between marital conflict and subsequent negativity in mother-child relationships, with the estimated effects being stronger in continuously married families than in divorced families, especially for women.	5	Tianyi Yu; Gregory S.

Variable-oriented analyses (structural equation modeling with a multigroup procedure) supported the spillover hypothesis, as higher levels of satisfaction in the spousal relationship were related to higher quality in the parent-child relationship and lower parental role restrictions. These connections did not differ by gender or country. With family typological analyses (mixture modeling), 4 family types were identified: families with satisfying relationships (73.4\% of the families), families with unsatisfying parent-child relationships (13.4\%), and families with either dissatisfied men (6.0\%) or dissatisfied women (7.2\%).	6	Kaisa Malinen; Ulla Kinnunen; Asko Tolvanen; Anna Ronka; Hilde Wierda-Boer; Jan Gerris

Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:2 307-317.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	1	This study examined the effects of reported maternal and paternal support, psychological control, and spanking on externalizing behavior of toddler boys. Questionnaires were administered to both parents of 104 two-parent families with a 3-year-old son. Both maternal and paternal psychological control was related to boys' externalizing behavior. Interaction effects were found, in that the association between maternal spanking and boys' externalizing behavior was stronger when levels of maternal support were high. High levels of paternal support strengthened the association between maternal support and boys' externalizing behaviors. Results suggest that the associations between specific parenting dimensions and children's externalizing behavior need to be considered within the context of other parenting dimensions that are displayed within the family.	5	Marjolein Verhoeven; Marianne Junger; Chantal Aken; Maja Dekovic; Marcel A.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	6	This study explores the relationship between residential, biological fathers' parental engagement, financial contributions, and psychological well-being in 2-parent families. Specifically, this study focuses on how fathers' parental engagement and financial contributions are related to their self-esteem, self-efficacy, and psychological distress. Analyses utilize data from the first 2 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics' Child Development Supplement and employ a subsample of father-child pairs (N = 771). The most consistent finding was that fathers' engagement in parenting and financial contributions to the family predicted improvements in fathers' psychological well-being. On the other hand, the results found very limited support for the more common proposition that healthy psychological functioning promotes increases in fathers' parental engagement and financial contributions.	1	Holly S.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	9	Parents' differentiation has been linked to negative psychological and behavioral outcomes in children, adolescents, and young adults. This line of research, however, has not been extended to families in later life. In this article, we use data from 671 mother-child dyads in 275 families in the greater Boston area to explore whether mothers' differentiation among their children is related to psychological well-being among offspring. We examined actual and perceived maternal differentiation in the domains of closeness, expectations for care, and conflict. We hypothesized that depressive symptoms would be higher when mothers differentiated among their children and when adult children perceived differentiation. Although the specific patterns varied somewhat by mothers' and children's reports, the findings indicated that, across all 3 domains, maternal differentiation was related to higher depression scores.	4	Karl Pillemer; J.

The potential moderating role of optimism and church-based social support was also examined. Mothers completed questionnaires when their child was 24 months old. Hierarchical regression revealed that mothers' perception of racism was a significant predictor of depression even after controlling for a variety of distal demographic characteristics and environmental stressors. Significant interactions suggested the importance of psychological and social characteristics in understanding maternal depression. Specifically, high levels of optimism and church-based social support buffered mothers from increased depressive symptomology attributable to perceived racism.	3	Erica C.

Journal of Marriage and Family. 72:2 360-374.	Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	7	Using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, this study examined intimate partner violence (IPV) and drinking partnerships in 741 young adults in male-female dating, cohabitating, and married relationships. Cluster analyses revealed four similar kinds of drinking partnerships: (a) congruent light and infrequent, (b) discrepant male heavy and frequent, (c) discrepant female heavy and infrequent, and (d) congruent moderate/heavy-frequent drinkers. Overall, there were no significant main effect differences across relationship type and clusters. The type of relationship and the type of drinking partnership interacted with contexts examined (i.e., type of violence severity, gender, and whether the violence was perpetration or victimization). Given the severity of IPV in couple relationships, additional empirical attention to drinking partnerships is warranted.	4	Jacquelyn D. Wiersma; H. Harrington Cleveland; Veronica Herrera; Judith L.

Journal of Marriage and Family	2010	10	This paper examines gender inequality in the determinants of job-related long-distance migration among married dual-earner couples during the 1980s and 1990s. The analysis tested the structural explanation, which attributes gender asymmetry in family migration to structural inequality in the labor market, and the comparative advantage explanation derived from relative resource theory. The analysis used individual- and family-level data from 5,504 Panel Study of Income Dynamics families, occupation-level data from the 1980 - 2000 U. S. Decennial Censuses Integrated Public Use Micro Samples, and discrete-time event history models. Gender differences in the determinants of family migration were not explained by gender differences in occupational characteristics, but the results partially support the relative resource theory by illustrating the conditioning influence of interspousal comparative advantage.	1	Kimberlee A.

Poetics	2010	20	Over the past 50 years, cognitive neuroscience has emerged as the dominant player in research on thought. In an effort to keep their voices heard, social psychologists, anthropologists, political scientists and even economists have joined cognitive neuroscientists in lively dialog. But many sociologists are stubbornly clinging to the sidelines, honoring - and in some cases strengthening rigid intellectual boundaries. Triggered by DiMaggio's (I 997) well sounded call to action, a distinct group of sociologists are challenging such boundaries and pursuing a new path. In this essay, I discuss several recent works that constitute a new and powerful page in cognitive sociology, and more broadly, in the study of culture and cognition.	1	Karen A. Cerulo

The paper adds these results to existing work on external classification systems to provide a framework for understanding the range of possible relationships between external classification systems and the cognition of individuals.	1	Hana Shepherd

Danna-Lynch, Karen. 2010. 'Switching Roles: the Process of Mental Weighing.' Poetics. 38:2, SI 165-183.	Poetics	2010	5	In this article I use a unique theoretical lens that incorporates work from sociology and cognitive psychology in order to address the question of how various forces (both institutional and internal) propel actors to ``switch'' from one role performance to another. I present data from in-depth interviews with 60 working parents from a variety of occupations to illustrate a process I call ``mental weighing''. Through mental weighing, actors sort and sift through various contextual cues and internal indicators to focus on (i.e., give weight to) those factors that are in line with the desired role performance. I itemize two different weighing activities: voluntary pushes and involuntary pulls. In describing these activities, I note the various ways that culture both enables and constrains the social actor. In this way, the study addresses the important question of what gives culture its pervasive influence while providing much called-for empirical evidence of sociocognitive practices in action.	1	Karen Danna-Lynch

Poetics	2010	3	While neuroscientists, cognitive anthropologists, and behavioral psychologists have begun to examine the dialectical relationship between space and cognition, sociologists have remained curiously silent. Sociologists concede that cognition affects our relationship to space, but seem less willing to explore how space might affect us cognitively. In this paper I argue that the spatial configuration of our environment facilitates particular cognitive modes. I examine what I call structured versus unstructured spaces. I also focus on the structuring of space and whether that structuring is imposed or implied. The structure of the space and the articulation of that structure interact to produce different modes of thought. This relationship between space and cognition has important implications for how and, perhaps, why we use culture.	1	Daina Cheyenne Harvey

We follow recent work at the intersection of culture and cognition in attempting to explicitly formulate the cognitive underpinnings of these two approaches in terms of the assumptions that they make about cultural acquisition, transmission and externalization. Our analysis suggests that in spite of very important differences in emphasis and explanatory range, toolkit and strong practice-theoretical approaches are complementary, although the specific types of modal situation for which each of them is best suited need to be more clearly specified. We develop a framework that shows how the two approaches can be deployed in conjunction as well as specifying the modal settings and situations that each will be more likely to handle best as well as those in which they will run into trouble.	2	Omar Lizardo; Michael Strand

I argue that this is unlikely, because of what we know about the limitations to our cognitive powers. I present a selective review of such results and make a few arguments for the implications regarding our understanding of culture.	1	John Levi Martin

Population Research and Policy Review	2010	0	We examine the relationship between marriage and welfare recidivism for women leaving a first welfare spell, using the 1979-2000 panels of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). Previous studies have found that women who marry around the time of welfare exit have lower rates of welfare return than women who stay single. However, more marriages occur before or after welfare exit than occur at the time of welfare exit. We find that marriages that precede or follow welfare exit by more than 12 months are not associated with significantly lower rates of welfare return. We also confirm previous findings that marriages formed within a year of welfare exit are associated with reduced rates of welfare return. However, these reduced rates mostly indicate later welfare returns rather than fewer welfare returns. Overall, our findings indicate a much weaker association between marriage and welfare independence than has been previously reported for this time period.	2	Tracy E. Roberts; Steven P. Martin
Patterson, Olivia, Frederick Weil & Kavita Patel. 2010. 'the Role of Community in Disaster Response: Conceptual Models.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:2 127-141.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	13	We focus on the role that community plays in the continuum of disaster preparedness, response and recovery, and we explore where community fits in conceptual frameworks concerning disaster decision-making. We offer an overview of models developed in the literature as well as insights drawn from research related to Hurricane Katrina. Each model illustrates some aspect of the spectrum of disaster preparedness and recovery, beginning with risk perception and vulnerability assessments, and proceeding to notions of resiliency and capacity building. Concepts like social resilience are related to theories of ``social capital,'' which stress the importance of social networks, reciprocity, and interpersonal trust. These allow individuals and groups to accomplish greater things than they could by their isolated efforts. We trace two contrasting notions of community to Tocqueville. On the one hand, community is simply an aggregation of individual persons, that is, a population. As individuals, they have only limited capacity to act effectively or make decisions for themselves, and they are strongly subject to administrative decisions that authorities impose on them. On the other hand, community is an autonomous actor, with its own interests, preferences, resources, and capabilities. This definition of community has also been embraced by community-based participatory researchers and has been thought to offer an approach that is more active and advocacy oriented. We conclude with a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of community in disaster response and in disaster research.	3	Olivia Patterson; Frederick Weil; Kavita Patel
McConnell, Eileen & Ilana Akresh. 2010. 'Housing Cost Burden and New Lawful Immigrants in the United States.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:2 143-171.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	2	Housing in the United States constitutes the largest expenditure for many households. Increasing rents and home prices, changes in the mortgage industry, and the growing importance of immigrants in the U.S. housing market underscore the value of examining the economic hardship that housing costs pose for immigrants. As is true for the native-born, immigrants' allocation of financial resources to housing influences the funds available for savings, investments, survival of emergencies, and the overall economic well-being of children and families. This project employs 2003 national-level data of legal permanent residents from the New Immigrant Survey to examine an outcome lacking sufficient empirical study: the proportion of household income spent on housing. The study examines whether disparities in immigrant housing cost burden by country/region of origin persist after accounting for differences in human capital, stage in the life cycle, assimilation, and other factors. The analyses disaggregate immigrants from Latin America, Asia, Europe and other areas into more nuanced categories. The results document that after controlling for a diverse array of variables, legal immigrants vary widely in housing cost burdens by country/region of origin. These disparities have implications for the future wealth accumulation and long-term financial security of immigrants in the United States.	2	Eileen Diaz McConnell; Ilana Redstone Akresh
Hoque, Nazrul, Margaret McCusker, Steve Murdock & Deborah Perez. 2010. 'the Implications of Change in Population Size, Distribution, and Composition on the Number of Overweight and Obese Adults and the Direct and Indirect Cost Associated With Overweight and Obese Adults in Texas Through 2040.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:2 173-191.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	2	Changes in population characteristics are associated with changes in the prevalence of physical and related health conditions with alternative types of population change leading to change in the prevalence of certain conditions. Examination of the effects of future demographic change on such conditions is, in turn, critical for understanding the future need for various types of health-related facilities and services. This article provides an example of how future demographic changes are likely to impact overweight and obese status in Texas, a rapidly growing and diversifying state. Specifically it uses population decomposition techniques to examine the relative impacts of population growth, aging and changes in the racial/ethnic composition of the population on increases in the prevalence and related costs of overweight and obesity in Texas, an important input for the formulation of statewide health policies. The number of overweight adults in Texas is projected to increase from 5.5 million in 2000 to 16.0 million in 2040, and the number of obese adults to increase from 3.5 million in 2000 to 14.6 million in 2040. The largest projected increases occur among Hispanics and other minority populations and for all race/ethnicity groups the increases are largest among those who are 65 years of age and older. Decomposition analysis indicates that of the projected increase of 10.5 million overweight adults from 2000 to 2040, 54.0\% is attributable to population increase, 15.0\% to change in age distribution, and 31.0\% to change in racial/ethnic composition. Of the projected increase in the number of obese adults, 61.6\% is due to population change and 38.4\% to change in racial/ethnic composition. The annual costs associated with overweight and obesity prevalence are expected to increase from \$10.5 billion in 2000 to \$40.3 billion in 2040. The results suggest that services to address these conditions will need to be widely dispersed across the state with particular concentrations of the elderly, Hispanics, and Other minority populations.	4	Nazrul Hoque; Margaret E.

Billingsley, Sunnee. 2010. 'the Post-communist Fertility Puzzle.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:2 193-231.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	11	Fertility has unanimously declined across the entire post-communist region. This study explores the variation in fertility trends over time among these countries and assesses to what degree three explanations are applicable: second demographic transition (SDT), postponement transition (PPT) or reaction to the economic crisis. Moreover, on the basis of SDT and PPT theoretical tenets, as well as descriptive evidence, the economic context is hypothesized to be linked to two processes of fertility decline conversely. The results show that no one theoretical explanation is sufficient to explain the complex fertility declines across the entire post-communist region from 1990 to 2003. In some countries, a great part of the decline in fertility occurred before significant postponement of childbearing began, which indicates that the dramatic decline was due to stopping behavior or postponement of higher order births. Postponement of first births, either through PPT or SDT processes, greatly contributed to fertility decline in a small number of countries. Pooled cross-sectional time-series analyses of age-specific birthrates confirm that these two distinct processes are present and show that the economic crisis explanation has explanatory power for declining birth rates. In contrast, logistic regressions show that the likelihood of postponing childbirth increases with improved economic conditions. These results confirm the importance of taking the economic context into account when discussing explanations for fertility decline. More specifically, the results indicate that the severity and duration of economic crisis, or absence thereof, influenced the extent and manner in which fertility declined.	1	Sunnee Billingsley
Baum, Scott & William Mitchell. 2010. 'Labour Underutilisation and Gender: Unemployment Versus Hidden-unemployment.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:2 233-248.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	1	As labour markets have become more complex there has been increasing interest among researchers in understanding the ways that social and labour market processes and contexts impact on various labour market states. One important area has been in understanding the differences between unemployment and hidden unemployment. This paper considers the ways in which these two labour market states differ for a sample of male and female respondents to the Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia (HILDA) survey. It presents data related to the reasons why respondents in these two labour force states consider they are jobless and analyses the characteristics of male and female respondents in the two labour market states to consider differences in outcomes. The findings suggest that there are differences in the two states of labour market outcomes and that these are further complicated when one considers processes for males and females.	2	Scott Baum; William F.

Saraff, Anjula & Harish Srivastava. 2010. 'Pattern and Determinants of Paternal Involvement in Childcare: an Empirical Investigation in a Metropolis of India.' Population Research and Policy Review. 29:2 249-273.	Population Research and Policy Review	2010	0	An analysis of various aspects of paternal involvement among Indian fathers is presented in this article. The pattern of involvement in terms of the activities participated in, and their frequency of participation have been examined. Overall level of involvement of fathers in childcare has also been determined. A number of hypotheses regarding predictors of paternal involvement have been formulated and examined with the use of empirical data. The study is based on interviews conducted with Indian couples (N = 350) having at least one child aged 10 years or younger. To understand the determinants of paternal involvement, regression has been conducted wherein paternal involvement has been regressed with 14 predictors. Results indicate that paternal involvement in childcare is mainly determined by the perception of individuals towards fatherhood-be it gender role expectations, or perception of the peer group, or fathering received by the individual fathers. Other socio-economic factors affecting paternal involvement have also been examined. As the importance of paternal involvement in childcare is increasingly being recognised, these findings have implications for programmers and policy makers. Interventions to bring about a positive change in the attitude of fathers may improve paternal participation.	2	Anjula Saraff; Harish C. Srivastava
Torche, Florencia. 2010. 'Economic Crisis and Inequality of Educational Opportunity in Latin America.' Sociology of Education. 83:2 85-110.	Sociology of Education	2010	5	Research in the industrialized world shows that the influence of family background on educational attainment has remained stable or declined over time. In contrast, very little is known about the developing world. Using high-quality data sets and a standard protocol, this article offers a comparative analysis of trends in educational stratification in four Latin American countries-Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Mexico. Latin America provides an interesting case study because the economic crisis and structural adjustment in the 1980s led to declines in family income, which may have resulted in growing inequality of educational opportunity. Findings are consistent with this hypothesis. They show a marked increase in socioeconomic inequality at the secondary and postsecondary levels for the cohorts that experienced the economic crisis. In addition, there is a decline in inequality in the lower educational transitions, which is explained by their universalization, a reduced advantage of males, and in some cases a growing advantage of females.	1	Florencia Torche
Meyer, John, Patricia Bromley & Francisco Ramirez. 2010. 'Human Rights in Social Science Textbooks: Cross-national Analyses, 1970-2008.' Sociology of Education. 83:2 111-134.	Sociology of Education	2010	19	In reaction to the disasters of the first half the 20th century and World War II, a dramatic world movement arose emphasizing the human rights of persons in global society. The contrast-celebrated in international treaties, intergovernmental and nongovernmental organizations, and much cultural discourse-was with narrower world emphases on the rights of citizens of national states. Since the 1970s, this movement has increasingly emphasized the importance of human rights education as central to sustaining human rights principles. This article examines the rise of human rights themes in secondary school social science textbooks around the world since 1970, coding data on 465 textbooks from 69 countries. The authors find a general increase in human rights discussions, especially since 1995. Human rights receive less emphasis in history texts than in civics or social studies ones, and there is less human rights emphasis in books that discuss national, rather than international, society. Human rights emphases are associated with the pedagogical student-centrism of textbooks: The proactive student is a rights-bearing student. Finally, a number of indicators of national development and especially political culture show positive effects on human rights emphases. These findings broadly support the arguments of institutional theories that the contemporary ``globalized'' world is one in which the standing of the participatory and empowered individual person has very great legitimacy.	3	John W.

Jennings, Jennifer & Thomas DiPrete. 2010. 'Teacher Effects on Social and Behavioral Skills in Early Elementary School.' Sociology of Education. 83:2 135-159.	Sociology of Education	2010	6	Although many recognize that social and behavioral skills play an important role in educational stratification, no studies have attempted to estimate teachers' effects on these outcomes. Using data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study-Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K), the authors estimate teacher effects on social and behavioral skills as well as on academic achievement. Teacher effects on social and behavioral skill development are sizeable, and are somewhat larger than teacher effects on academic development. Because-as is shown here-social and behavioral skills have a positive effect on the growth of academic skills in the early elementary grades, the teachers who are good at enhancing social and behavioral skills provide an additional indirect boost to academic skills in addition to their direct teaching of academic skills. Like previous studies, the authors find that observable characteristics of teachers and the instructional approaches utilized in their classrooms are weak predictors of teacher effects. However, the present results suggest that the teachers who produce better than average academic results are not always the same teachers who excel in enhancing social and behavioral skills.	2	Jennifer L.

Carbonaro, William & Elizabeth Covay. 2010. 'School Sector and Student Achievement in the Era of Standards Based Reforms.' Sociology of Education. 83:2 160-182.	Sociology of Education	2010	5	The authors examine whether standards based accountability reforms of the past two decades have closed the achievement gap among public and private high school students. They analyzed data from the Education Longitudinal Study (ELS) to examine sector differences in high school achievement in the era of standards based reforms. The authors found that students in Catholic and private secular schools enjoy greater math gains from 10th to 12th grade than comparable public school students. However, they found that these advantages are largely concentrated among more advanced math skills. Moreover, private school students took more academic math courses than public school students, even after controlling for family background and prior achievement. These differences in course taking accounted for most of the public-private difference in achievement gains.	2	William Carbonaro; Elizabeth Covay

Teaching Sociology. 38:2 81-92.	Teaching Sociology	2010	3	The teaching and learning movement in sociology in general and within the American Sociological Association specifically has a surprisingly long history. This history can be divided into three periods of activity: early efforts (1905 to 1960), innovation and implementation (1960 to 1980), and the institutionalization of gains (1980 to 2009). Beginning in the first period, sociologists interested in teaching and learning focused cycles of attention on the introductory sociology course in higher education, high school sociology courses, and the formation of sections within the American Sociological Association. Hans Mauksch led a period of significant innovation in the 1960s and 1970s. Many of those gains were then institutionalized under the leadership of Carla Howery beginning in the 1980s. Publication related to teaching and learning, which was once spread throughout numerous outlets has, over time, become focused in Teaching Sociology. This article presents an investigation of the past and present of the teaching and learning movement in sociology and offers some suggested direction for the movement's future.	1	Jay R. Howard

Teaching Sociology. 38:2 93-105.	Teaching Sociology	2010	3	This article describes a departmental initiative designed to integrate the teaching of graduate and undergraduate sociology through research methodology and the completion of actual research projects. The goal was to develop a multilevel team approach within which faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates would view their work as part of a connected project. The authors describe the three central components of the multilevel approach: a newly required research seminar for graduate students, an approach to teaching research methods in a joint seminar of graduate and undergraduate students, and an approach to teaching undergraduate research methods that includes having graduate students model research techniques for undergraduates. The authors then assess each of these components based on course evaluations and additional data gathered from participants. The authors conclude with a series of suggestions about how this model might be expanded and developed further in their own and other institutional contexts.	4	Sara Shostak; Jennifer Girouard; David Cunningham; Wendy Cadge
Huisman, Kimberly. 2010. 'Developing a Sociological Imagination by Doing Sociology: a Methods-based Service-learning Course on Women and Immigration.' Teaching Sociology. 38:2 106-118.	Teaching Sociology	2010	2	The author addresses the development and implementation of a service-learning project for an undergraduate course in which students interview immigrant women, incorporate the interviewees' experiences into an analytical paper, and present the findings at the end of the semester. Students are required to use C. Wright Mills's concepts of history and biography by situating the stories told by the women within the larger sociohistorical contexts in which they live. The article proceeds in four sections. The first section provides an overview of service learning and its benefits. This is followed by a detailed description of the service-learning project. In the third section, the author draws from a postclass survey, course evaluations, and her observations to illustrate the ways in which the project enhances student learning and enables students to deepen their understanding of the sociological imagination. The article concludes with suggestions for how the project can be applied in other courses.	1	Kimberly Huisman
Bird, Sharon & Karla Erickson. 2010. 'a Constructive Controversy Approach to ``case Studies''.' Teaching Sociology. 38:2 119-131.	Teaching Sociology	2010	1	On the basis of analysis of student responses to a case study titled `'Drinks and Dinner,'' the authors evaluate the pedagogical potential of using constructive controversy case studies to teach about inequality. `'Drinks and Dinner'' is designed to capture the complexity of social interactions that defy simple solutions to engage students in increasingly sophisticated discussions of subtle gender bias and the practical contingencies of power in the workplace. Having taught the case several times in two distinct institutional cultures, the authors use student reactions to this classroom exercise to consider some of the pedagogical payoffs of constructive controversy case studies. The intentional ambiguities written into `'Drinks and Dinner'' defy simple solutions and require students to discuss while incorporating, honoring, and addressing differences of opinion, not only among the characters in the story but also among the students in the classroom. In the authors' preliminary implementations of the case, they found that students applied course concepts, considered multiple viewpoints, and, in some cases, moved from individualized explanations to structural analysis of how inequality is reproduced. The authors conclude with ideas for how to implement similar cases in other courses that could benefit from requiring students to actively and collectively solve problems related to inequality and the routine use of power.	2	Sharon R.

Berkowitz, Dana, Namita Manohar & Justine Tinkler. 2010. 'Walk Like a Man, Talk Like a Woman: Teaching the Social Construction of Gender.' Teaching Sociology. 38:2 132-143.	Teaching Sociology	2010	1	The authors describe a pedagogical exercise that conveys the multilayered properties of gender to undergraduate students. They propose a simulation that demonstrates the social constructiveness of gender, maintaining that gender should be conceptualized and portrayed as a process, system of stratification, and social structure. The authors begin by detailing the theoretical premises that guide their conceptualization of gender. Next, they move to the simulation exercise they use to demonstrate their conceptualization, furnishing detailed instructions to successfully implement the exercise and providing suggestions to guide class discussions emerging thereof. The authors conclude by detailing the results of an assessment showing the learning gained through the exercise. This article addresses the lacunae in the sociology of gender, created in particular by the limited nature of scholarship on the teaching of gender as a social construction.	3	Dana Berkowitz; Namita N.

Teaching Sociology	2010	0	The purpose of this article is to document how a course in the fundamentals of sociology encouraged students to rethink negative impressions about people with AIDS. Multimethod, active learning processes were utilized to introduce the sociological imagination, critical thinking, and theory and methods in sociology. The intent was to apply basic sociological knowledge to a real-world issue, HIV/AIDS in a global perspective. In the process of developing basic skills in sociology, a consistent change was noted in students' self-reported impressions about people with AIDS in each of four semesters (N = 160). Catastrophic contagion characterized their impressions at the beginning of the semester; humanizing attributes (encouragement and empowerment) replaced catastrophic contagion at the end of the semester. Implications of these findings for teaching and learning, and deconstructing HIV/AIDS stigma, are discussed.	1	Robin D. Moremen

Although there are many potential benefits of in-depth interviewing assignments for both majors and nonmajors, few have developed tools one can use to teach this method at the first and second year, especially in substantive classes where instruction in interviewing is constrained by time and practical circumstances. In this note, the authors present an in-class exercise and tip sheet they developed to teach beginning undergraduates how to conduct quality in-depth interviews. Comparative analysis of students' preliminary and final interview guides, as well as the results of a student survey, support the teaching effectiveness of the workshop and tip sheet.	2	Victoria Healey-Etten; Shane Sharp

This system, political semiosis, is able to identify and assess the performative speech acts, the demonstrative orientational specifications, and the mimetic representations required to advance historical transformations. The features of political semiosis structure the flow of historical events by managing the specific media and generic forms that are the vehicles through which events take shape. Political semiosis provides a method for analyzing both the circulation and the materialization of events. The exemplary case of September 11 illuminates this approach's capabilities.	1	Robin Wagner-Pacifici

Using California data, this study shows that children living very close to a child previously diagnosed with autism are more likely to be diagnosed with autism. An underlying social influence mechanism involving information diffusion drives this result, contributing to 16\% of the increase in prevalence over 2000-2005. We eliminate competing explanations (i.e., residential sorting, environmental toxicants, and viral transmission) through seven tests and show that information diffusion simultaneously contributed to the increased prevalence, spatial clustering, and decreasing age of diagnosis.	3	Ka-Yuet Liu; Marissa King; Peter S.

American Journal of Sociology	2010	5	Migrants form nonfamilial ties in urban destinations, which could compete with origin families for a share of remittances. A framework of competing commitment predicts that new relationships affect remittances depending on the extent to which they substitute for the benefits provided by origin families. Analyses of data from urban migrants in Kenya show that serious nonmarital sexual partners substitute for psychosocial support from the rural family and that material transfers migrants give to these partners significantly reduce remittances. The findings have implications for the ways scholars conceive of competition, the nature of exchange, and substitution of support across intimate relationships.	1	Nancy Luke

This study utilizes 36 time use surveys from 19 countries (spanning 1965-2003) combined with original national-level data in multilevel models to examine household task segregation. Analyses reveal that men do less and women do more time-inflexible housework in nations where work hours and parental leave are long. Women do less of this work where there is more public child care and men are eligible to take parental leave. National context affects the character of gender inequality in the home through individual- and national-level pathways.	1	Jennifer L. Hook

This article uses log-linear models and data from the March Current Population Survey to describe trends in the association between spouses' earnings and estimate their contribution to growing earnings inequality among married couples from 1967 to 2005. The results indicate that increases in earnings inequality would have been about 25\%-30\% lower than observed in the absence of changes in the association, depending on the inequality measure used. Three components of these changes and how they vary across the earnings distribution are explored.	1	Christine R. Schwartz

Results show a panethnic effect-greater residential proximity within panethnic boundaries than between, net of ethnic group size and metropolitan area that is dependent on immigration. A lower degree of social distance between panethnic subgroups is observed for blacks, whites, and Latinos, and less for Asians, yet ethnonational groups continue to maintain some degree of distinctiveness within a racialized context.	2	Ann H.

The national government must pursue a Metro Policy to help cities and metropolitan areas leverage these critical assets in the service of productive, sustainable, and inclusive growth. There are early signs that the Obama Administration embraces this new vision of Metro Policy. The President's rhetoric recognizes the critical role cities and metropolitan areas play in the national economy and the need for a new generation of federal policies that leverage this economic primacy. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and FY 2010 budget invest directly in the assets that drive prosperity. But President Obama inherits a federal government replete with legacy programs, diminished in capacity, and without a coherent federalist philosophy, which will be obstacles for the structural reform necessary for Metro Policy.	1	Bruce Katz

City \& Community	2010	5	In American popular discourse and policy debates, ``public housing'' conjures images of ``the projects''-dysfunctional neighborhood imprints of a discredited welfare state. Yet this image, so important in justifying deconcentration, is a dangerous caricature of the diverse places where low-income public housing residents live, and it ignores a much larger public housing program-the \$100 billion-plus annual mortgage interest tax concessions to (mostly) wealthy homeowners. In this article, we measure three spatial aspects of assisted housing, poverty, and wealth in New York City. First, local indicators of spatial association document a contingent link between assistance and poverty: vouchers are not consistently associated with poverty deconcentration. Second, spatial regressions confirm this result after controlling for racial segregation and spatial autocorrelation. Third, factor analyses and cluster classifications reveal a rich, complex neighborhood topography of poverty, wealth, and housing subsidy that defies the simplistic stereotypes of policy and popular discourse.	2	Elvin Wyly; James DeFilippis

Analyzing in-depth interviews with 41 families who were relocated from a severely distressed public housing development, I explore how neighborhood-based social capital is drawn upon for safety by examining how people kept safe in public housing, and what happens when these social ties are taken away through forced relocation. I find that their relatively new status in these neighborhoods translates into less socializing and weaker local ties. Moreover, since they counted on social ties for protection previously, this lack of integration leaves a substantial portion feeling more vulnerable.	1	Susan Clampet-Lundquist
Graves, Erin. 2010. 'the Structuring of Urban Life in a Mixed-income Housing ``community''.' City \& Community. 9:1 109-131.	City \& Community	2010	7	Developing mixed-income communities has drawn increased attention from sociologists and other researchers in recent years, generating sharp debates over equitable access, the nature of community, and the role of policy. Debates over social relations and social influence in mixed-income communities have often overlooked what formal institutions-as opposed to race, class, and other predictors of informal neighboring-contribute to social life. This study uses ethnographic fieldwork, document analysis, and semistructured interviews in a mixed-income housing community in Boston to examine the forces shaping relationships within and across social boundaries. The results show how formal structuring of the community dissuaded interaction among neighbors. Buttressed by macrostructural forces, the private management company that ran the development discouraged interaction through rules, social signaling, and explicit communication.	1	Erin M. Graves
Willis, Paul. 2010. 'Sym-bolon Symbol-action-context.' Ethnography. 11:1 3-23.	Ethnography	2010	3	The Greek roots for the word symbol are sym (thrown) and bolon (together). In the recent idealized and abstract turn of the social sciences towards `discourse', it has been forgotten how in their production meanings carried by symbols are precisely thrown together with material, social, and interactive circumstances. Urban ethnographers are well equipped to see the signifier not as `free-floating' but as always engaged - through its intransigent opacities as well as its transparent relevancies - in socially situated context and social action as it finds its signified. Utilizing examples from my own ethnographic work, this article presents an urban and class-specific view of how symbols are thrown together with the circumstances of material want, social pressure, and ideological abjection suffered by young people at the bottom of social space in deprived urban areas. The struggle for survival here produces cultural forms and meanings which are no less creative and complex than the recognized formal creations of `art' but are formed in quite different ways under pressure and compression, rather than in `choice' and `freedom'.	1	Paul Willis
Katz, Jack. 2010. 'Time for New Urban Ethnographies.' Ethnography. 11:1 25-44.	Ethnography	2010	2	Advances in urban sociology now depend on developing the temporal dimensions of ethnographic data. For public place behavior, the need is to follow people before, through, and after the sites where fly-on-the-wall researchers traditionally have observed them. To understand how people economically exploit a city's public life, researchers must follow market responses that discount and redistribute initial advantages. For explaining the formation of neighborhoods, a multiphase social theory is required. Drawing examples from Los Angeles, nine historical processes are shown to have shaped a substantively wide range of cases, including officially preserved, Orthodox Jewish, affluent totemic, low-income ethnic immigrant, and homeless service areas. A historical approach shows that the social character stamped onto a neighborhood early in its history is often effaced or reversed by later processes, identifies new formative processes, and locates the major turning point in a different period, the 1960s, than do theories stressing globalization and deindustrialization.	1	Jack Katz
Deener, Andrew. 2010. 'the `black Section' of the Neighborhood Collective Visibility and Collective Invisibility as Sources of Place Identity.' Ethnography. 11:1 45-67.	Ethnography	2010	1	The public identity of a neighborhood does not always reflect its demographic composition. Some groups sustain their collective visibility as they experience demographic decline. Oakwood, a neighborhood in Los Angeles where African Americans once made up the largest segment of the population, is still known as the `black section of Venice' despite the fact that Latinos have outnumbered African Americans since 1980 and whites have outnumbered them since 1990. Historical and ethnographic research illuminates the divergent processes through which African Americans and Latinos became associated with Oakwood, established qualitatively distinct ties to the area, and maintained differing degrees of influence over its local culture. African Americans' social institutions, political organizations, visible patterns of public interaction, and periodic celebrations and commemorations enabled them to sustain their claim to the neighborhood, while Latino immigrants' marginal citizenship status, avoidance of public spaces, and affiliation with other places prevented them from attaining collective visibility.	1	Andrew Deener
Sheth, Anup. 2010. 'Little India, Next Exit Ethnic Destinations in the City.' Ethnography. 11:1 69-88.	Ethnography	2010	0	In Southern California, as in many other metropolitan regions across the US, some places are identified as ethnic destinations: publicly labeled or branded urban spaces designed to highlight an ethnic area to city residents and tourists. This article analyzes the social and political processes that are critical to the ethnic branding of urban places by examining a political dispute in 2003 over the placement of a freeway sign in the City of Artesia, in southeastern Los Angeles County, that would have identified the area as `Little India' to passing motorists. This article shows that ethnic labeling does not arise simply from an area's demographic composition; ethnic entrepreneurs play an important role. Ethnic tensions, which can emerge when labeling is proposed, can fragment residents and businesses in the locality. If this occurs, the decisions of political actors and their relationships to one another are critical to resolving - or exacerbating - the dispute.	1	Anup Sheth
Tavory, Iddo. 2010. 'the Hollywood Shtetl From Ethnic Enclave to Religious Destination.' Ethnography. 11:1 89-108.	Ethnography	2010	0	This article analyzes the relation between the development of religious institutions and neighborhood formation in the main Jewish Orthodox neighborhood of Los Angeles. The Melrose-La Brea neighborhood, an ethnically Jewish area since the 1930s, was transformed by religious place entrepreneurs from the East Coast in the 1970s. The emerging Orthodox community, however, was not principally populated by converting secular Jews. Instead, by developing prestigious institutions, religious place entrepreneurs made it into a viable destination for Orthodox Jews across the United States. Contrary to `supply side' models developed in the sociology of religion, I then argue that institutional `supply' may be successful without producing local `religious demand'. Moving from a market metaphor to examine the role of far reaching networks, I contend that the success of religious place entrepreneurs in this case emerged from the relation between institutional development, the production of neighborhood identity, and population movements within an ethnic geography.	1	Iddo Tavory

Ethnography	2010	0	I was raised in the New Haven suburb of Hamden and attended the town's public schools during the 1950s. This article discusses the differences of class, ethnicity, and race as I encountered them in my neighborhood and schools and the understandings of these differences that I developed. At the time, the region centered on an industrial city, and its class and status order revolved largely around the rankings of occupational roles in an industrial society. Yet, the system of stratification was being transformed both by the rising prosperity of the working class and by the efforts of second and third generation immigrant ethnic groups, principally Italian Americans, to gain recognition as the equals of other groups, including Protestants of old New England backgrounds. Lifestyles were modest compared with today, and yet the distinctions between groups and strata were clear and strongly defended.	1	Victor Lidz
Durr, Marlese. 2010. 'Small Town Life a Study in Race Relations.' Ethnography. 11:1 127-143.	Ethnography	2010	0	Moving to southern Ohio from upstate New York was a necessity: I needed the job. I wondered what it would be like to live in the Midwest as a single African American woman. I soon learned that racial, social, and sexual homogeneity compounded to make my new neighborhood into a cohesive whole from which I was excluded. Confronting daily expressions of hostility from neighbors and pointed comments about race from students, I wrote notes on my kitchen calendar to record these odious events. I was an `exception' but still an `outsider', a reminder of what people who belonged to this nearly all-white gay-partnered community did not want. My `outsider-ness' afforded me some immunity, yet veiled conversation said `she's not so different from the rest of them'. This article discusses my reawakening to homogeneity as the basis for solidifying social bonds, while I learned more about myself.	1	Marlese Durr
Lee, Victoria. 2010. 'the Mosque and Black Islam Towards an Ethnographic Study of Islam in the Inner City.' Ethnography. 11:1 145-163.	Ethnography	2010	2	This ethnographic study of a predominantly African American, Sunni Muslim mosque and the surrounding African American Muslim community explores the role that Islam plays in an inner-city neighborhood in the northeastern US. It seeks to understand the culture of the African American mosque, to shed light on why great numbers of African Americans are turning to Islam, and to determine what effects Islam has on contemporary black communities. This article draws on six months of fieldwork centered on the mosque, immersion in the mosque's community, conversations with the mosque's male and female leadership, and African American members' accounts of how they were drawn to Islam. The larger study seeks to identify ongoing social, political, and economic problems faced by the black community in the inner city and to illuminate how religion in general and Islam in particular succeed or fail in creating community solidarity, stimulating community mobilization, and serving as a driving force for social change.	1	Victoria J.

Ethnography	2010	2	Through an ongoing team fieldwork project that entails ethnographic observations and interviews at multiple research sites in southern California, this study seeks an understanding of the growth of contemporary megachurches by examining how they go about the business of attracting new members and retaining old ones. In this article, we focus on how the megachurches assist members in addressing personal issues through diagnostic and prognostic framing within large congregational gatherings and problem-oriented small groups. These processes are elaborated through the intensive examination of a small group dealing with `the problem of same-sex attraction'. The study explains the appeal of megachurches at two levels: for individuals, megachurches sharpen and fine-tune an expanding array of personal problems or issues; and, at the organizational and institutional level, they have become major players in the self-help market.	4	David A.

Ethnography	2010	1	Drawing on ethnographic field research in Bangalore, a multi-ethnic, multi-lingual city in South India, this article explores the relationship between cinema and the city and the significance of the urban setting for the cinema experience, for moviegoers and film business insiders. Contrary to received understandings of cinema as a universal and placeless experience, interviews with audiences, filmmakers, distributors and exhibitors reveal that locality is important for the framing and embedding of cinema, for the meanings associated with any particular film or genre. The article suggests that urban space-cultures which situate cinema are consequential for both the box office performance of the film and the audiences' experience.	1	Lakshmi Srinivas
Wood, Charles, Chris Gibson, Ludmila Ribeiro & Paula Hamsho-Diaz. 2010. 'Crime Victimization in Latin America and Intentions to Migrate to the United States.' International Migration Review. 44:1 3-24.	International Migration Review	2010	2	Among the challenges faced by Latin America at the onset of the 21st century is the increase in crime and violence that began in the mid-1980s, and which, to one degree or another, has afflicted most countries in the region. In this study we explore the potential implications of the upsurge in crime on migration by testing the hypothesis that crime victimization in Latin America increases the probability that people have given serious thought to the prospect of migrating with their families to the United States. Using Latinobarometro public opinion surveys of approximately 49,000 respondents residing in 17 countries in 2002, 2003, and 2004, the results of a Hierarchical Generalized Linear Model found that, net of individual and country-level control variables, the probability of seriously considering family migration to the United States was around 30 percent higher among respondents who reported that they or a member of their family was a victim of a crime sometime during the year prior to the survey. Evidence that victimization promotes the propensity to emigrate is a finding that contributes to an understanding of the transnational consequences of the increase in crime in Latin America, and adds a new variable to the inventory of factors that encourage people to migrate to the United States.	4	Charles H.

International Migration Review	2010	6	This article engages debates about migrant integration by analyzing political trust and satisfaction in 24 European countries. The evidence suggests that first-generation migrants have the most positive attitudes, while native-origin and second-generation migrant-origin individuals have similar political trust and satisfaction scores. To explain these outcomes, I focus on the importance of subjective integration factors related to the stages of migration. I claim that first-generation migrants, who have gone through the disruptive process of changing countries, will have lower expectations and be more likely to have positive evaluations of the host society. In comparison, native-origin and second-generation migrant-origin individuals have been raised in the same society and are likely to share perspectives toward that society's political institutions.	1	Rahsaan Maxwell

International Migration Review	2010	9	In recent times, many nations are experiencing an increase in anti-immigrant attitudes on the part of natives. Most papers only explore one or two sources of anti-immigrant attitudes at a time, which provides an incomplete picture of the effects at work. This paper tests eight different explanations for anti-immigrant attitudes: cultural marginality theory, human capital theory, political affiliation, societal integration, neighborhood safety, contact theory, foreign investment, and economic competition. Analysis is conducted using combined data from the European Social Survey and Eurostat/OECD and individual-, regional-, and national-level predictors. Results indicate that key predictors of anti-immigrant attitudes are regional and national interpersonal trust, education level, foreign direct investment, and political variables.	1	Elisa Rustenbach

International Migration Review	2010	3	National narratives play a key role in state consolidation and identity construction. This article proposes four factors that may affect how a regime chooses to portray the role of migrants and migration in official historical narratives: the relationship of emigrants to the colonial versus the post-independence state; the relationship between migration and sending state economic development; and the relationship between migrants and the home state elite - either benign neglect or instrumentalization. Taking Jordan and Lebanon as cases, the presentation examines school textbooks as key sources of the national narrative to discern their treatment of major population movements. It concludes with an evaluation of the four factors, finding greatest support for that of instrumentalization.	1	Laurie A. Brand

International Migration Review	2010	3	Our study examines how immigrants cluster in co-ethnic neighborhoods. We systematically explore the effects of three factors on the co-ethnic clustering of immigrants: economic resources, co-ethnic preferences, and the use of co-ethnic information sources. The study is based on a unique data set that provides rarely available rich information on housing search collected in Toronto in 2006. Focusing on Asian Indians and Chinese immigrants, the results clearly suggest that of all preferences, only co-ethnic preference is related to co-ethnic clustering of the two groups when income and use of co-ethnic resources are taken into consideration, and that levels of co-ethnic clustering are not related to the economic resources of immigrants. The findings also reveal that some effects are distinctive to specific groups. Although immigrants use various co-ethnic resources to obtain housing information, only the use of co-ethnic real estate agents is significant, and that only for the clustering of Chinese, not for Asian Indians.	2	Eric Fong; Elic Chan
Thomas, Kevin. 2010. 'Household Context, Generational Status, and English Proficiency Among the Children of African Immigrants in the United States.' International Migration Review. 44:1 142-172.	International Migration Review	2010	0	This study examines how household and parental-level determinants affect English proficiency among the children of African immigrants in the United States. Within immigrant families, the study finds that children's level of proficiency has a stronger positive association with the proficiency of their mothers than with that of their fathers. Children's level of English proficiency significantly increases as the number of other English-proficient children within their household increases. These impacts are stronger on the proficiency levels of first compared to second-generation children. Levels of proficiency are, however, lowest among children in families from Portuguese-speaking countries followed by their counterparts in families from countries where indigenous languages and Arabic are dominant. Although proficiency levels generally improve with increasing generational status, these improvements are smallest for children in families from Portuguese-speaking countries. Except for children in families from English-speaking countries, the largest improvements to proficiency with increasing generational status were observed among children in families from indigenous language backgrounds.	1	Kevin J.

Stewart, Quincy & Jeffrey Dixon. 2010. 'Is It Race, Immigrant Status, or Both? an Analysis of Wage Disparities Among Men in the United States.' International Migration Review. 44:1 173-201.	International Migration Review	2010	2	The intersection of race and immigrant status forms a unique social space where minority group members and immigrants are afforded or denied the privileges that are routinely accorded to native-born, non-Hispanic whites. Yet recent research on the intersection of race and immigrant status is inconsistent in its findings, limited to a small number of racial groups, and does not account for the geographic distribution of racial/ethnic groups. In this paper, we shed light on the intersection of race and immigrant status by answering two questions: (1) Do racial disparities in socioeconomic outcomes vary by nativity? and (2) Do native-immigrant disparities in socioeconomic outcomes vary by race? Using 2000 Census data linked to metropolitan area and sending country data, we find that racial disparities are similar and significant among natives and immigrants (Question 1). Asians, blacks, and Latinos fare significantly worse than their white counterparts in both the native and immigrant populations. Furthermore, our analysis of native-immigrant wage disparities by race reveals that the immigrant experience is considerably worse for Asians, blacks, and Latinos (Question 2). These groups also receive fewer wage returns to years spent in the U.S. and their wage disparities are magnified by the percentage of immigrants in a metropolitan area - whereas all whites receive a wage premium when living in an area with a larger share of immigrants. The results suggest that race and immigrant status work in concert to uniquely influence the social experience of immigrant minorities in the U.S.	2	Quincy Thomas Stewart; Jeffrey C. Dixon
Lancee, Bram. 2010. 'the Economic Returns of Immigrants' Bonding and Bridging Social Capital: the Case of the Netherlands.' International Migration Review. 44:1 202-226.	International Migration Review	2010	10	This paper aims at explaining to what extent social capital can help immigrants in the Netherlands make headway on the labor market. Two forms of social capital are identified. Bonding refers to a dense network with thick trust and is measured as the strength of family ties and trust in the family. Bridging implies a crosscutting network with thin trust and is measured as inter-ethnic contacts and outward orientation. It is examined to what extent bonding and bridging for immigrants in the Netherlands can be associated with a higher likelihood of employment and higher income. Results show that (1) bridging networks are positively associated with both employment and income; (2) bonding networks do not affect economic outcomes; and (3) levels of trust (neither thick nor thin) cannot explain economic outcomes.	1	Bram Lancee
Haas, Hein. 2010. 'Migration and Development: a Theoretical Perspective.' International Migration Review. 44:1 227-264.	International Migration Review	2010	58	The debate on migration and development has swung back and forth like a pendulum, from developmentalist optimism in the 1950s and 1960s, to neo-Marxist pessimism over the 1970s and 1980s, towards more optimistic views in the 1990s and 2000s. This paper argues how such discursive shifts in the migration and development debate should be primarily seen as part of more general paradigm shifts in social and development theory. However, the classical opposition between pessimistic and optimistic views is challenged by empirical evidence pointing to the heterogeneity of migration impacts. By integrating and amending insights from the new economics of labor migration, livelihood perspectives in development studies and transnational perspectives in migration studies - which share several though as yet unobserved conceptual parallels - this paper elaborates the contours of a conceptual framework that simultaneously integrates agency and structure perspectives and is therefore able to account for the heterogeneous nature of migration-development interactions. The resulting perspective reveals the naivety of recent views celebrating migration as self-help development ``from below''. These views are largely ideologically driven and shift the attention away from structural constraints and the vital role of states in shaping favorable conditions for positive development impacts of migration to occur.	1	Hein Haas

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	26	Religious congruence refers to consistency among an individual's religious beliefs and attitudes, consistency between religious ideas and behavior, and religious ideas, identities, or schemas that are chronically salient and accessible to individuals across contexts and situations. Decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research establish that religious congruence is rare, but much thinking about religion presumes that it is common. The religious congruence fallacy occurs when interpretations or explanations unjustifiably presume religious congruence.	1	Mark Chaves

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	7	Using data from the International Social Survey Program and the World Values Survey about current and former religious adherence, we calculate country-level religious-conversion rates for 40 countries. Drawing upon a theoretical model based on rational individual choice, we posit that the frequency of religious conversion depends on the cost of switching and the cost of having the ``wrong'' religion. Findings accord with several hypotheses: religious-conversion rates are positively related to religious pluralism, gauged by adherence shares; negatively related to government restrictions on religious conversion; positively related to levels of education; and negatively related to a history of Communism. Conversion rates are not related to per capita GDP, the presence of state religion, and the extent of religiosity. Effects from the types of religious adherence are minor, except for the negative effect of Muslim adherence.	3	Robert Barro; Jason Hwang; Rachel McCleary
Desmond, Scott, George Kikuchi & Kristopher Morgan. 2010. 'Congregations and Crime: Is the Spatial Distribution of Congregations Associated With Neighborhood Crime Rates?.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:1 37-55.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	4	Few studies have focused on how religious congregations are associated with crime rates, especially at the neighborhood level. Using data for more than 400 block groups in Indianapolis, we focus on the relationship between different types of congregations (e.g., evangelical Protestant, civically engaged) and eight different types of crime controlling for a variety of neighborhood characteristics. The results suggest that neighborhoods with more evangelical Protestant congregations have higher rates of both violent and property crimes. Neighborhoods with more mainline and black Protestant congregations have higher rates of property crimes, but not violent crimes. Finally, although civically engaged congregations are associated with lower neighborhood crime rates, the association may be limited to some types of property crimes. Therefore, the positive association between evangelical Protestant congregations and crime may be more general, and the negative association between civically engaged congregations and crime more limited, than previous research has suggested.	3	Scott A.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	5	I use cognitive dissonance theory as a framework to examine coping strategies used by men endeavoring to maintain a coherent sense of themselves as gay Christians. Using interviews with black gay Christian men, I uncover a strategy used to maintain that identity in the face of stigmatizing religious rhetoric. While these men have managed to reconcile their religious and sexual identities, sermons delivered by church leaders disrupt that reconciliation, causing them to have to neutralize these anxiety-inducing attitudes. This study shows that they focus accusations of illegitimacy on the speaker rather than the doctrine by denigrating the speakers' knowledge, morality, focus, and motivations. In this way, they neutralize the sting of churches' negative messages by neutralizing the moral authority of the churches' messengers. These findings offer new insight into how parishioners persist in religious communities in which their sexual behaviors or identities are condemned.	1	Richard N. Pitt

In particular, we test for the effects of group cues, identity, and a new cue-the decision-making process-in which communicating the way a source went about making a decision can affect how other cues are utilized. In contrast to decades of research, we find that a group cue has little effect, while the process cue alters how in- and out-group members think about environmental protection and the players involved in this political drama.	2	Paul A.

Lindsay, D. & Robert Wuthnow. 2010. 'Financing Faith: Religion and Strategic Philanthropy.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:1 87-111.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	1	Over the last century, a new form of strategic philanthropy arose-that of the private foundation. Foundations do not account for a large portion of donations received by religious organizations, but they can deploy important resources at critical moments. Examining data between 1999 and 2003 from the Foundation Center on grants and grant making, we find that a very small number of foundations are dominant actors in religious strategic philanthropy. These organizations introduce isomorphic tendencies within American religion. Federal tax policies and financial scandals precipitated the emergence of more organizational forms-regranting organizations, supporting organizations, and oversight organizations. Factors such as secularization, religious pluralism, and globalization have generated new challenges for private foundations, and in the aggregate, these developments have contributed to a restructuring within the world of religious philanthropy.	2	D.

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:1 112-126.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	4	Research typically defines evangelical belonging as affiliation with an evangelical denomination, but this approach excludes many self-identified evangelicals, even though previous studies of religious groups find that self-identification is a powerful predictor of political preferences. Using data from the National Survey of Religion and Politics, we investigate the usefulness of self-identification for classifying evangelicals. The effects of three types of evangelical belonging (religious tradition-only, self-identification-only, and a combination of religious tradition and self-identification) on respondents' political attitudes, party identification, and vote choice suggest that religious tradition is a good predictor of political attitudes while self-identification is a good predictor of party identification. We conclude that self-identification and tradition are both important to understanding evangelicalism and politics in America.	2	Andrew R. Lewis; Dana Huyser Bernardo
Pepper, Miriam, Tim Jackson & David Uzzell. 2010. 'a Study of Multidimensional Religion Constructs and Values in the United Kingdom.' Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:1 127-146.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	5	A growing number of studies have systematically examined the relationships between religiousness and value priorities. However, few studies have utilized multidimensional constructs of religiousness or attempted to distinguish among the value priorities of the religious. Using a general public sample and a churchgoer sample in the United Kingdom, this article examines the associations between Schwartz's values, several general religion measures, and conceptualization of God. Religiousness aligns most strongly along the conservation/openness to change value dimension, and spirituality is rotated further toward self-transcendence values. Findings suggest a shift among the religious away from an emphasis on security. God concepts are uniquely related to some value types. Particularly among the churchgoers, for whom God concepts may be especially formative, characteristics attributed to God are reflected in value priorities. These findings support the theoretical assertion that conceptualization of God is a foundational religious belief implicated in more specific values, attitudes, and beliefs.	3	Miriam Pepper; Tim Jackson; David Uzzell

Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion. 49:1 147-161.	Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion	2010	3	Adapted from a Shin Buddhist style of meditation, Naikan (''inner-looking'') is a week-long contemplative practice that involves reviewing one's life from the perspectives of others and has been called an indigenous Japanese psychotherapy due to its effectiveness in treating a variety of disorders. Data collected during an extended ethnographic study of Naikan in both Japan and Austria reveal that Naikan, a ``secularized'' practice that removes overtly Buddhist references and practices, effects changes in clients' subjectivity that are strikingly similar to those sought after in Buddhist traditions. This suggests that Naikan operates therapeutically on an existential level and employs cognitive techniques that, while originating in Buddhism, remain efficacious outside a Buddhist context. The potential for certain contemplative practices to effect transformations of subjectivity across religious and cultural contexts may be greater than commonly assumed.	2	Chikako Ozawa-de; Brendan Ozawa-de

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	22	In this article, I propose and define the new concept of cultural health capital, based on cultural capital theories, to help account for how patient-provider interactions unfold in ways that may generate disparities in health care. I define cultural health capital as the repertoire of cultural skills, verbal and nonverbal competencies, attitudes and behaviors, and interactional styles, cultivated by patients and clinicians alike, that, when deployed, may result in more optimal health care relationships. I consider cultural health capital alongside existing frameworks for understanding clinical interactions, and I argue that the concept of cultural health capital offers theoretical traction to help account for several dynamics of unequal treatment. These dynamics include the often nonpurposeful, habitual nature of culturally-mediated interactional styles; their growing importance amidst sociocultural changes in U. S. health care; their direct and indirect effects as instrumental as well as symbolic forms of capital; and their ability to account for the systematic yet variable relationship between social status and health care interactions.	1	Janet K.

Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	9	Literature on health disparities documents variations in clinical decision-making across patient characteristics, physician attributes, and among health care systems. Using data from a vignette-based factorial experiment of 256 primary care providers, we examine the cognitive basis of disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of coronary heart disease (CHD). We explore whether previously observed disparities are due to physicians (1) not fully considering CHD for certain patients or (2) considering CHD but then discounting it. Half of the physicians in the experiment were primed with explicit directions to consider a CHD diagnosis, and half were not. Relative to their unprimed counterparts, primed physicians were more likely to order CHD-related tests and prescriptions. However, the main effects for patient gender and age remained, suggesting that physicians treated these demographic variables as diagnostic features indicating lower risk of CHD for these patients. This finding suggests that physician appeals to perceived base rates have the potential to contribute to the further reification of socially constructed health statistics.	5	Karen E. Lutfey; Kevin W.

Ramirez-Valles, Jesus, Lisa Kuhns, Richard Campbell & Rafael Diaz. 2010. 'Social Integration and Health: Community Involvement, Stigmatized Identities, and Sexual Risk in Latino Sexual Minorities.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:1 30-47.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	6	The purpose of this study is to contribute to the conceptual understanding and practical application of social integration theory to health behaviors. We test whether community involvement in AIDS and GLBT organizations moderates the relationship of racial and homosexual stigmata to sexual risk behavior among gay and bisexual men and transgender persons of Latin American origin or descent. We use structural equation modeling to analyze data from a sample of 643 individuals recruited via respondent-driven sampling. Among those not involved in community organizations, homosexual and racial stigmata are related to sexual activity under the influence of alcohol and drugs, which is linked to sexual risk behavior. Among the involved group, the stigmata are not linked to sexual activity under the influence of alcohol and drugs, or to sexual risk behavior. The moderating role of community involvement seems to be more salient in those currently involved than those ever involved.	4	Jesus Ramirez-Valles; Lisa M. Kuhns; Richard T. Campbell; Rafael M. Diaz

'Victimization in Early Life and Mental Health in Adulthood: an Examination of the Mediating and Moderating Influences of Psychosocial Resources.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:1 48-63.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	8	Although numerous studies have documented the long-term effects of childhood victimization on mental health in adulthood, few have directly examined potential mediators and moderators of this association. Using data from the Welfare, Children, and Families project (1999)-a probability sample of 2,402 predominantly black and Hispanic low-income women with children living in Boston, Chicago, and San Antonio-we predict psychological distress in adulthood with measures of physical assault and sexual coercion before age 18. Building on previous research, we test the mediating and moderating influences of emotional support, instrumental support, and self-esteem. Although we observe no indirect effects of physical assault, the effect of sexual coercion is partially mediated by instrumental support and self-esteem. We also find that the effects of physical assault and sexual coercion are moderated (buffered) by emotional support and self-esteem.	4	Terrence D. Hill; Lauren M. Kaplan; Michael T. French; Robert J.

Mueller, Anna, Jennifer Pearson, Chandra Muller, Kenneth Frank & Alyn Turner. 2010. 'Sizing Up Peers: Adolescent Girls' Weight Control and Social Comparison in the School Context.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:1 64-78.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	10	Using the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and multi-level modeling, we examine the role of social comparison with schoolmates in adolescent girls' weight control. Specifically, we focus on how girls' own weight control is influenced by the body sizes and weight-control behaviors of their schoolmates. Our findings suggest that comparisons with similar others (in this case, girls of a similar body size) appear to have the strongest association with individual girls' reports of trying to lose weight. For example, the odds that an overweight girl is engaged in weight control increase substantially when many overweight girls in her school are also trying to lose weight. This study highlights how schools play an important role in shaping girls' decisions to practice weight control and demonstrates how social comparison theory improves our understanding of how health behaviors are linked to social contexts.	5	Anna S.

Schmeer, Kammi. 2010. 'Household Income During Childhood and Young Adult Weight Status: Evidence From a Nutrition Transition Setting.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:1 79-91.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	1	This article explores whether household income at different stages of childhood is associated with weight status in early adulthood in a nutrition transition setting (a developing country with both underweight and overweight populations). I use multinomial logistic regression to analyze prospective, longitudinal data from Cebu, Philippines. Results suggest that increasing prenatal income is associated with lower risk of being underweight at age 21, while increasing income during childhood is associated with an increased risk of being overweight at age 21. When gender differences are considered, prenatal income has an important protective effect against the risk of being overweight for girls. For boys, prenatal income has little effect on overweight status, but early childhood income increases their risk of becoming overweight. For both boys and girls, income in mid-childhood (ages 9-12) is associated with a particularly high risk of becoming overweight by age 21, net of earlier income. These results suggest that, in this nutrition transition setting, childhood income operates through complex developmental and behavioral mechanisms to affect early adult overweight status; and that increasing household income after birth may do little to prevent underweight status in early adulthood.	1	Kammi K.

Zajacova, Anna & Sarah Burgard. 2010. 'Body Weight and Health From Early to Mid-adulthood: a Longitudinal Analysis.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:1 92-107.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	3	We analyze the influence of body weight in early adulthood, and changes in weight over time, on self-rated health as people age into middle adulthood. While prior research has focused on cross-sectional samples of older adults, we use longitudinal data from the NHANES I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study and double-trajectory latent growth models to study the association between body mass index (BMI) and self-rated health trajectories over 20 years. Results indicate that high BMI in early adulthood and gaining more weight over time are both associated with a faster decline in health ratings. Among white women only, those with a higher BMI at the baseline also report lower initial self-rated health. A small part of the weight-health association is due to sociodemographic factors, but not baseline health behaviors or medical conditions. The findings provide new support for the cumulative disadvantage perspective, documenting the increasing health inequalities in a cohort of young adults.	2	Anna Zajacova; Sarah A. Burgard
Boardman, Jason, Casey Blalock & Fred Pampel. 2010. 'Trends in the Genetic Influences on Smoking.' Journal of Health and Social Behavior. 51:1 108-123.	Journal of Health and Social Behavior	2010	11	Using twin pairs from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States, we estimate that 35 percent of the variance in regular smoking is due to additive genetic influences. When we disaggregate the sample by birth cohort we witness strong genetic influences on smoking for those born in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1950s, but negligible influences for those born in the 1940s and 1960s. We show that the timing of the first Surgeon General's Report coincides with an increase in the genetic influences on regular smoking, but subsequent legislation prohibiting smoking in public places has significantly reduced these influences. These results are in line with existing gene-environment interaction theory, and we argue that variation in genetic influences across cohorts makes it difficult and potentially misleading to estimate genetic effects on health behaviors from data obtained from a single point in time.	3	Jason D.

Halfmann, Drew & Michael Young. 2010. 'War Pictures: the Grotesque as a Mobilizing Tactic.' Mobilization. 15:1 1-24.	Mobilization	2010	6	This article examines the uses and effects of grotesque imagery in the antislavery and antiabortion movements and considers implications for theories of movement framing and mobilization. Grotesque images can produce strong emotions that may increase the resonance of movement frames and provide physiological ``evidence'' of immorality. Such images may also produce confusion and ambiguity that deeply engages readers or viewers and potentially breaks frames. But grotesque images can also be counterproductive for activists. They can cause readers or viewers to turn away in disgust, and their use can taint activists as prurient, irrational, uncivil, or manipulative. Finally, the effects of grotesque images are likely to vary across audiences, social contexts, and the skill of the activists that deploy them.	2	Drew Halfmann; Michael P. Young
Jung, Jai. 2010. 'Disentangling Protest Cycles: an Event-history Analysis of New Social Movements in Western Europe.' Mobilization. 15:1 25-44.	Mobilization	2010	1	The theory of protest cycles has informed us that the external political environment and the internal competition among social movement organizations are distinct elements leading to the emergence, development, and decline of popular protest. This theory, however, has not been examined systematically. I conduct an event-history analysis to test and refine the theory of protest cycles using a well-known new social movement event dataset. While proposing a general way of operationalizing the core concepts in social movement studies, I show that political opportunity only matters during the initial phase of social movement mobilization, rather than throughout the movement's lifespan. What explains declining frequencies of protest occurrence during the demobilization phase is the joint effect of two internal factors: the institutionalization of social movements and the growing violence during protests.	1	Jai Kwan Jung
Currier, Ashley. 2010. 'the Strategy of Normalization in the South African Lgbt Movement.' Mobilization. 15:1 45-62.	Mobilization	2010	3	The article theorizes and presents normalization as a movement-level strategy available to social movements dealing with an internal threat. By defining themselves against an internal threat's abnormality through a process of normalization, social movement organizations assert how they and the movement operate within socially and politically respectable parameters. Drawing on ethnographic, interview, and newspaper data, I show how mainstream South African lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) movement organizations deployed normalization to marginalize and expel an internal threat, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance, between 1998 and 2006.	1	Ashley Currier
Horton, Lynn. 2010. 'Defenders of Nature and the Comarca: Collective Identity and Frames in Panama.' Mobilization. 15:1 63-80.	Mobilization	2010	1	This article examines collective identities as both a resource and constraint in framing processes of social mobilization through a case study of Panama's Kuna Indians, one of Latin America's most effectively organized indigenous peoples. It highlights tensions between movement nurturance of distinct indigenous identity as intrinsically valuable and to a degree counterhegemonic and instrumental use of an environmental frame to advance indigenous land claims. This article also explores shifts in dominant discourse and institutional practices that provide both opportunities for identity-based movements as well as risks. One way identity groups address tensions between appropriation of externally generated frames for instrumental goals and the nurturing of distinct collective identities is to manage multiple frames aimed at distinct audiences with distinct content.	1	Lynn R.

Velez-Velez, Roberto. 2010. 'Reflexivity in Mobilization: Gender and Memory as Cultural Features of Women's Mobilization in Vieques, 1999-2003.' Mobilization. 15:1 81-97.	Mobilization	2010	0	This article explores the significance of reflexivity as a cultural process in social movements. It examines the roles that gender and memory played in mobilizing women in the antimilitaty movement in Vieques, Puerto Rico, between 1999-2003. In particular, the analysis focuses on the articulations and actions undertaken by the Alianza de Mujeres Viequenses. While some emerging research stresses the novelty of women's participation in the latest effort to remove the U.S. Navy from this island, none have operationalized the event in a theoretical context and highlighted key nuances. This article engages literatures on the significance of gender in the mobilization process as well as the cultural nature of remembrance and its significance in the meaning-making process for collective actors. It does so through an examination of the mobilization of women in the antimilitary movement. Furthermore it argues for the acknowledgement of reflexivity in the examination of claims articulation for mobilization.	1	Roberto Velez-Velez
Mong, Sherry & Vincent Roscigno. 2010. 'African American Men and the Experience of Employment Discrimination.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:1 1-21.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	3	The economic marginalization of African American men has been studied in a variety of contexts, from trade union exclusion, to joblessness, to disparate wages and mobility. Discrimination is often inferred as an influential mechanism, yet seldom directly examined in its own right. Drawing on a unique sample of verified workplace discrimination cases, this article analyzes forms and processes of discrimination that African American men face in employment. Our results denote the prevalence of discriminatory firing, with on-going racial harassment and discriminatory promotional and hiring practices also quite evident. In-depth immersion into case materials highlights the centrality of racial stereotyping and significant discretion on the part of gatekeepers within organizational environments-discretion in the use of ``soft skills'' criteria to exclude and debilitate mobility, and in selective (or even targeted) use of seemingly neutral organizational policies and sanctions. Moreover, harassment on the job-something that conventional workplace inequality research has overlooked-is quite problematic and well-represented in these data. We conclude by discussing the implications of our results for the conceptualization of inequality reproduction and that pertaining to race, status, and the workplace in particular.	2	Sherry N.

Kaler, Amy. 2010. 'Gender-as-knowledge and Aids in Africa: a Cautionary Tale.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:1 23-36.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	1	This article is based on my experience with translating research about AIDS, masculinity and risk in Malawi into the public sphere. My work was misinterpreted as demonstrating that African men want to get AIDS because they think it reaffirms their masculinity. I use the concept of gender-as-knowledge to organize my analysis of this response. I argue that media representations of AIDS in 21st century Africa are filtered through a centuries-old prism of racialized gender knowledge, in which African men are presumed to be irrational, sexually voracious, and uninhibited. This article concludes with cautions about the complexities of translating social research into the public sphere.	1	Amy Kaler
Froyum, Carissa. 2010. 'the Reproduction of Inequalities Through Emotional Capital: the Case of Socializing Low-income Black Girls.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:1 37-54.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	3	The concept of emotional capital suggests that adults transfer emotion management skills to children in ways that are consequential for the social reproduction of inequalities. Using ethnographic data from a popular after-school program, this study analyzes the emotional capital transmitted to low-income black girls by staff. They passed on four aspects of emotional capital: stifling attitude, being emotionally accountable for peers, sympathizing with adult authority figures, and emotional distancing from cultural ``dysfunction.'' Staff intended to teach girls to manage their emotions as a way to counteract racism, but the socialization largely promoted emotional deference, thereby reinforcing racialized, classed, and gendered ideologies.	1	Carissa M.

Hart, Randle. 2010. 'There Comes a Time: Biography and the Founding of a Movement Organization.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:1 55-77.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	0	The social movement literature lacks a historically sensitive analysis of pathways to founding and leading a movement organization. I connect biography and history to explain the timing and form of organizational emergence. I show how Robert Welch's founding of the conspiratorial John Birch Society was pre-dated by moral shocks, a supportive culture and social network, experience organizing people in committees, as well as some dumb luck (in the form of fortuitous timing), all of which grew his reputation in the latent conservative movement. A national reputation allowed him to gather resources and unite regionally dispersed radical rightists into a coherent national organization.	1	Randle J. Hart
Gans, Herbert. 2010. 'Public Ethnography; Ethnography as Public Sociology.' Qualitative Sociology. 33:1 97-104.	Qualitative Sociology	2010	1	Since ethnography is arguably the kind of sociology of most appeal to the lay public, public ethnography, particularly participant observation research, should be a major form of public sociology. Public ethnography differs from academic ethnography when its sites and subjects are relevant to what the lay public wants and needs to know, and when it is written in non technical English. This article spells out the requirements, conditions and processes involved in making relevant ethnography acceptable to the lay public and thus turning it into public ethnography.	1	Herbert J. Gans
