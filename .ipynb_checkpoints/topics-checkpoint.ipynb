      "\n",
      "Tell me something interesting about how the The New York Times covers abortion. I've pulled every story that the Times ran that contained the word abortion between 1987 and 2008 which includes 14,269 articles totalling 14,626,680 words (90 MB). This is a lot, so I would recommend restricting your analysis to just those that were nationally focused, which incluces just 5,406 and a mere 5,906,630 words (36 MB). \n",
      "\n",
      "This dataset of articles is not far from the one the data used in [DiMaggio, Paul, Manish Nag, and David Blei. \"Exploiting affinities between topic modeling and the sociological perspective on culture: Application to newspaper coverage of US government arts funding.\" Poetics 41.6 (2013): 570-606.](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304422X13000661). This should give you a starting point for thinking about the kinds of things that can be operationalized and the kinds of analysis that can be accomplished.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two major goals for today, and keep them both in mind as you work on the mission.\n",
      "2. Understanding the benefits and limitations of topic models in the social sciences.\n",
      "1. Mastering the application of topic models in Python.\n",
